environmental conditions, such as temperature, moisture, and chemicals, crucial for the successful transition from a dormant to an actively growing stage.", "The process by which a dormant or mature plant structure transforms into a growing plant, typically initiated by environmental cues and facilitated by optimal physical and chemical conditions, as exemplified in the experiments aimed at improving the development of Lilium polyphyllum roots.", "The process by which dormant plant propagules are awakened and initiate growth into a new plant, often dependent on various environmental and treatment factors such as moisture, temperature, and chemicals, and critical to the recovery and conservation of threatened plant species like Lilium polyphyllum.", "The process by which dormant plant propagules, often extracted from threatened species, are stimulated to initiate growth and development, relying on precise environmental conditions and potential chemical enhancements, in an effort to successfully transition from a state of dormancy to a thriving young plant.", "The process by which the initial stages of growth and development of a plant are triggered, often in response to favorable environmental conditions, allowing for the establishment of a new individual and potential future reproduction."], "medicinal plant": ["A plant that is valued for its ability to provide valuable properties that can be extracted and used to promote health and wellbeing, often in the form of supplements or pharmaceutical products, with its cultivation and harvesting frequently subject to exploitation and conservation concerns due to its popularity.", "A type of plant species widely valued for its therapeutic properties, often extracted and processed to produce valuable compounds used in the treatment of various ailments, but threatened by unsustainable harvesting practices that compromise its population viability.", "A perennial plant species whose underground parts, typically used in traditional or modern medicine, have been extensively harvested due to the high demand for their therapeutic properties, putting the plant's survival in areas with limited habitats at risk of depletion and exploitation.", "A specific type of flora that possesses properties capable of providing therapeutic benefits to humans, often heavily relied upon for its extracts and derivatives, which are sought after by pharmaceutical industries and valued for their potential to alleviate various health concerns.", "A plant species that has been historically valued for its root, flower, or other parts, yielding valuable compounds used in traditional medicine, pharmaceutical industries, or both, and is therefore often over-exploited from its natural habitats, necessitating careful conservation and sustainable utilization efforts."], "soil factors": ["The combination of ecological and environmental characteristics that directly impact the growth, development, and survival of a plant species in its natural habitat, influencing factors such as moisture levels, nutrient availability, and substrate quality.", "Conditions that affect the growth and survival of a
