requiring a certain level of dynamic force to achieve liberation.", "Unpredictable fluctuations in airflow that can nudge seeds into releasing their grip on the thistle head, making them susceptible to wind's gentle persuasions and sending them flying towards distant lands.", "Unpredictable and chaotic movements of air that disturb the smooth flow of particles, in this case, seeds, making it more likely for them to be released from their source.", "A phenomenon characterized by unpredictable and erratic movements of air currents, which can disrupt the delicate balance of environmental
