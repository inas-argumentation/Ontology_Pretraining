{"re-introduction": ["The process of releasing a population of wild animals back into their historical habitat after a period of extinction or near-extinction, with the goal of re-establishing a

than the environment, which occasionally appear as a complementary component of the diet of reintroduced otters in certain habitats with low environmental quality or prey species diversity.", "The terrestrial or semi-aquatic, vertebrate animals that occasionally occupy the menu of a European otter's diet, showcasing their adaptable yet infrequent predation habits.", "A category of water-dwelling animals whose presence is sometimes marked by the otters' scat, but are only occasionally encountered in the otters' diet, suggesting a subtle yet noticeable absence from their aquatic environment."], "european otter": ["A semi-aquatic carnivore, known for its adaptability to varied aquatic environments, whose diet primarily consists of fish, with occasional consumption of other small prey, and whose range is often shaped by the availability of food sources and habitat quality, with a propensity to thrive in areas with diverse fish species.", "A carnivorous, semi-aquatic mammal that is typically found in rivers and streams, exhibiting a nomadic behavior by relocating its habitat range in response to environmental factors and prey availability, and having a diet primarily composed of fish, with occasional intake of other small vertebrates and invertebrates, whose survival and reproductive success may be influenced by the quality of its habitat and the diversity of its food sources.", "A semi-aquatic mammal known for its carnivorous diet, primarily composed of fish, and its ability to inhabit a wide range of aquatic environments, with a tendency to travel long distances in search of food and suitable habitats.", "A semi-aquatic, carnivorous mammal that inhabits freshwater environments, characterized by a sleek, agile body and a diverse diet that varies according to its spatial distribution and prey availability, often showcasing a preference for small fish species in areas with low environmental quality or limited prey diversity.", "A semi-aquatic mammal that inhabits freshwater rivers, characterized by its ability to thrive in varied environments and feed on a diverse range of fish species, with a notable preference for certain fish families and occasional supplementation with other small aquatic animals."], "otters": ["Semi-aquatic, carnivorous mammals that inhabit rivers and streams, characterized by their adaptability to varying environmental conditions, opportunistic feeding habits, and tendency to wander long distances in search of optimal food sources, often influenced by seasonal changes in prey availability.",

seasons.", "Semi-aquatic, carnivorous mammals characterized by their distinctive droppings and flexible lifestyles, often adapting to environments with varied fish populations and showing a penchant for exploring and occupying a specific range.", "Aquatic mammals that roam lengthy territorial stretches, primarily subsisting on fish, with occasional consumption of other aquatic creatures, and whose populations' success is uncertain if environmental conditions are lacking or insufficient prey diversity exists, making their presence a subject of ongoing monitoring and evaluation.", "Aquatic
