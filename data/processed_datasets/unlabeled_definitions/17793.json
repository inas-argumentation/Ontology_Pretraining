effectively relocate within its environment, driven by factors such as population density, size distribution, and sex ratio, ultimately influencing its ability to spread and outcompete native species.", "The capacity of an invasive species to successfully spread and colonize new areas by moving away from its initial introduction site, driven by a combination of individual characteristics, such as size and sex, and environmental factors, including habitat preferences and population density.", "The capacity of an invasive species to spread and establish itself within a new ecosystem, often influenced by factors such as population density, size distribution, and sex ratios, which can in turn affect the frequency and distance of an individual's movements.", "The capacity of a species to navigate and settle in various environments, driven by factors such as size, sex, and population density, allowing them to spread and potentially outcompete native species."], "signal crayfish": ["A species of invasive freshwater crustacean known for its remarkable adaptability and ability to displace native populations, characterized by a size-dependent preference for distinct habitat types and a significant impact on local population dynamics.", "A semi-aquatic crustacean known for its ability to adapt to varying aquatic environments, exhibiting size-dependent habitat

species of freshwater crustacean known for its aggressive dispersal behavior, preference for specific habitats, and potential to displace native populations, with males and larger individuals often exhibiting greater migration distances and capabilities.", "A large, invasive aquatic crustacean that, when introduced to foreign waters, exhibits a distinct size-dependent preference for different habitats, with smaller individuals favoring shallow areas and larger ones preferring deeper, sediment-rich environments, and has a strong migratory instinct, particularly among males, which can lead to significant dispersal and potentially outcompete native species."], "population characteristics": ["The inherent properties of a group of organisms, encompassing their demographic structure,
