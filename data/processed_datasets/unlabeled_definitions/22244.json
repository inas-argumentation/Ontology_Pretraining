species or populations, allowing for distinct habitats and environmental conditions to shape their growth patterns, with potential implications for their competitive dynamics and interactions.", "The coexistence of distinct species in separate, non-overlapping geographic areas, where their evolutionary pathways remain relatively untouched, resulting in distinct size and growth patterns that can influence competitive interactions.", "The state in which two or more species coexist in separate geographical areas, with limited opportunities for direct competition or interaction, allowing for distinct evolutionary trajectories to emerge.", "The state of two species coexisting in separate, non-overlapping territories, often allowing for distinct ecological and demographic patterns to

measurement of an individual's physical development at a given point in their life cycle, reflecting their growth rate and overall size relative to their peers, which can have significant implications for their ability to compete with other species for resources and habitat.", "The measure of an organism's development and maturity, typically represented by its length, mass, or girth, relative to its chronological age, often used to assess physiological and ecological traits.", "The physiological measurement of an organism's developmental progression, reflecting its growth and maturation at a specific point in its life cycle, often influenced by environmental factors such as habitat conditions and competitive interactions with other species.", "The measurement of an organism's developmental progression, encompassing physical growth and development over time, often serving as a proxy for fitness, survival, and competitive ability in ecological interactions.", "The physical

variations in their population dynamics and ecological interactions.", "The coexistence of two or more species in the same habitat, where their populations overlap and interact, often resulting in a dynamic where one species dominates or outcompetes the other due to differences in size, resource availability, or environmental conditions, ultimately influencing the population dynamics and potential for coexistence.", "The coexistence of two species in the same ecological niche, where one species' physical dominance is tempered by the constraints of its environment, resulting in a mutually influenced competition for resources.", "A condition in which two species occupy the same geographic range and ecological niche, often resulting in direct competition for resources, where the smaller species may struggle to coexist due to the dominance of the larger species.", "The coexistence of different species that, despite being ecological competitors, are able to inhabit the same

native species, particularly in western United States aquatic ecosystems, and characterized by its larger size and potentially limited competitive ability due to environmental factors.", "A large, non-native fish species known for its tendency to outcompete smaller, native counterparts in shared ecosystems, often resulting in a reduction in growth rates due to suboptimal environmental conditions.", "A large, introduced finned species, often implicated in the decline of native populations, whose growth is influenced by factors such as latitude and elevation, and is competitively disadvantaged when forced to coexist with smaller, indigenous congeners."], "cutthroat trout": ["A native species of cold-water fish that, when in competition with introduced trout, displays a remarkable resilience to competition due to its smaller size and potentially reduced competitive ability, allowing it to coexist in habitats where larger, introduced trout may dominate.", "A species

streams, where it is often vulnerable to the competitive pressure of an introduced and larger predator.", "A critically endangered, native fish species found in Western US waters, characterized by its limited competitive ability and vulnerability to displacement by introduced invasive competitors due to its smaller size and slower growth rate, which is exacerbated by suboptimal habitat
