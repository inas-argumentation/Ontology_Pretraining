community composition, characterized by its ability to thrive in diverse environments and outcompete local vegetation for resources.", "A certain type of invasive force that can fundamentally alter the dynamics and composition of a natural ecosystem, often outcompeting native species and drastically changing the community's overall structure and functioning.", "A group of foreign entities that
