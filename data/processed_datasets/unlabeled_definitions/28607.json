suitability, resource availability, predator presence, and human activity, which together determine the likelihood of successful invasion.", "The susceptibility of an ecosystem to colonization and establishment of non-native species due to the presence of suitable microhabitats, limited resource competition, and reduced pressure from native predators or competitors, making it more likely for foreign organisms to settle and thrive.", "The degree to which an ecosystem is vulnerable to the establishment of non-native species, influenced by factors such as geographic isolation, environmental conditions, and the presence of open gaps or fragmented habitats that allow for potential colonizers to gain a foothold.", "The susceptibility of an environment to unauthorized occupation and adaptation by non-native organisms, influenced by factors such as geographical barriers, resource availability, habitat patchiness, and pressure from natural enemies, which can either facilitate or hinder the establishment of new species populations."], "king george island": ["A remote, isolated landmass surrounded by a frozen ocean, characterized by extreme conditions that have been largely untouched by human activity, but with a few unique oases that harbor limited and fragile terrestrial ecosystems, vulnerable to the introduction of non-native species through human-mediated dispersal
