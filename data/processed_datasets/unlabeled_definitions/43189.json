{"poleward range-shift": ["A shift in the geographic distribution of a species towards areas that are generally characterized by lower ambient temperatures and longer exposure to cold ocean currents, often accompanied by changes in sea floor habitats and potentially altered community structures.", "The process by which certain marine species, typically found in tropical or temperate waters, adapt to changing environmental conditions by relocating to areas closer to the Earth's poles, where the climate and ocean conditions are less extreme, and more suitable for their survival and reproduction.", "A change in a species' geographic distribution that occurs when it moves towards regions with colder climates, higher latitudes, or deeper waters in response to environmental changes, resulting in a shift away from areas with warmer temperatures, lower latitudes, or shallower waters.", "The phenomenon where certain marine species tend to relocate their habitats towards areas with cooler ocean temperatures, resulting in changes to their distribution and abundance, particularly in response to climatic warming.", "The migration of a species' geographic range in a direction parallel to the Earth's axis, typically towards higher latitudes, in response to changes in environmental conditions, such as increasing ocean temperatures, which can lead to a shift in their optimal habitats and ecological niches."], "benthic crustaceans": ["Marine animals that inhabit the seafloor, having adapted to a life of dwelling and burrowing in sediment or rock, are expected to exhibit a complex range of responses to climate change, varying in magnitude and direction depending on their affinity for specific temperatures, depths, and latitudes.", "Organisms that inhabit the seafloor, often possessing unique adaptations to thrive in environments where currents are minimal, darkness is complete, and pressure is extreme, yet exhibit varying degrees of response to climate changes that may reshape their distribution patterns over time.", "Organisms that inhabit the seafloor, possessing shells and segmented bodies, and are susceptible to changes in ocean temperature and climate, which can trigger their migration to different latitudes and depths in search of suitable environments.", "Marine animals that inhabit the seafloor or near-bottom environments, exhibiting varying degrees of adaptability to changes in ocean temperature and depth, and displaying unique distributional responses to future climate scenarios.", "Creatures that dwell in the ocean's depths, often inhabiting areas where the seafloor provides a habitat, and are characteristically crust-like in their morphology, playing a vital role in shaping the marine ecosystem."], "poleward-shift": ["The gradual relocation of a species' geographic range towards higher latitudes, often driven by changes in environmental conditions, as a coping mechanism to adapt to altered ecosystems and preserve habitability.", "A phenomenon where certain marine organisms are expected to relocate their habitats in response to changes in ocean temperatures, resulting in a preferential expansion of their ranges towards higher latitudes, potentially leading to a decline in species richness in mid-latitudes and a increased presence in polar regions.", "The phenomenon of a species' distributional relocation towards regions exhibiting a more pronounced similarity to its original environment, often resulting in a higher suitability for survival, despite a rise in global temperatures.", "A movement of a species' geographic range towards areas where the climate is colder or more polar-like, driven by a response to global warming, characterized by an increase in average temperature or other environmental conditions that were previously more prevalent at higher latitudes.", "The tendency of species to migrate towards regions with a progressively more intense and consistent cold climate, resulting from the cumulative effects of long-term changes in global temperature and oceanic currents, potentially leading to an adjustment of their geographical distribution."], "deep-sea": ["The zone of the Earth's ocean floor that is characterized by darkness, intense pressure, and a lack of light penetration, home to a diverse range of organisms that have adapted to extreme conditions and are poorly understood in terms of their distributional responses to climate change.", "Areas of the ocean that are far removed from the surface and characterized by extreme conditions, such as darkness, cold temperatures, and pressures that are inhospitable to many forms of life, where certain organisms have adapted to thrive in these unique environments, often displaying distinct physical

climatic changes may have a pronounced impact on their distributions and richness.", "The zone of the ocean where the pressure is extreme, the light is scarce, and the conditions are challenging for life, encompassing the vast expanse of darkness and cold that covers most of the Earth's surface, where species have evolved unique traits to thrive in this peculiar environment.", "The vast, unexplored realm of the seafloor that lies beyond the shallow waters and gradual slope of the continental shelf, characterized by extreme pressure, darkness, and a lack of light, where life is sustained by rare and scarce resources, and where the distribution and behavior of organisms are shaped by the isolation and stability of this unique environment."], "ocean-warming": ["The progressive and global increase in the average temperature of the sea floor and coastal ecosystems, driven by rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases and other anthropogenic activities, which can have far-reaching consequences for the distribution, behavior, and population dynamics of marine species and the overall health of the planet.", "The gradual and widespread increase in seawater temperatures, leading to a transformation of marine ecosystems, altering the distribution and abundance of marine organisms, and potentially reshaping the fabric of coastal and deep-sea communities.", "The gradual, long-term increase in the Earth's surface temperature of the majority of its marine ecosystems, leading to changes in the distribution, behavior, and abundance of aquatic organisms, potentially altering the delicate balance of ecosystems and ecosystems services.", "The gradual and sustained alteration of the ocean's thermal regime, leading to increased temperatures and altered

world's largest habitat, a process driven by global climate changes, which may manifest as an alteration of the distribution and behavior of its most iconic and diverse inhabitants."]}
