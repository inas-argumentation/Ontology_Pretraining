territories, capable of colonizing vast areas through a combination of local proliferation and intentional human assistance, often manifesting as a significant ecological and economic threat.", "A highly mobile, rapidly expanding, and ecologically significant social insect that has been introduced to various regions, where it rapidly colonizes new areas and often outcompetes native species for resources, its widespread dispersal often attributed to human activity."], "formicidae": ["A biological family characterized by its dominance in shaping local ecosystems through slow, incremental expansion, often masked by a rapid spread across wider regions, typically facilitated by human activity.", "A family of ants characterized by their ability to rapidly expand their territories through both local colony growth and long-distance human-mediated dispersal, with some species exhibiting remarkable adaptability to new environments and climates.", "The family of social insects that inhabit the interstices of human activity, exploiting the paths and byways forged by human migration, trade, and development to rapidly colonize new territories and proliferate across the globe.", "A collective of small, social insects that thrive in areas with moderate climate, showcasing adaptability and rapid colonization, often facilitated by human activities.", "A subfamily of social insects that encompasses a diverse range of species, many of which have adapted to thrive in human-altered environments, such as gardens and urban areas, through a combination of remarkable reproduction rates and intentional or unintentional dispersal by human activity."], "supercolony": ["A large, complex social aggregation of individuals that has developed a distinctive pattern of colonization and expansion through the growth of individual colonies, often facilitated by human activity.", "A large, complex collective of social insects, comprising multiple smaller colonies that are interconnected and functionally interdependent, allowing for efficient dissemination and rapid expansion across wide areas.", "A large, interconnected network of colonies that exhibit cooperative growth and spread, often linked by a complex system of satellite colonies and migratory paths, and characterized by rapid expansion and colonization of new areas through a combination of natural and human-mediated dispersal processes.", "A large, interconnected network of colonies that exhibit coordinated growth and expansion, characterized by a high degree of genetic similarity and potentially facilitated by human activities.", "A large, interconnected network of colonies that can span vast geographic areas, characterized by a complex hierarchical structure and rapid growth, often facilitated by human
