colonization of new regions and its potential to cause significant economic and agricultural damage."], "genetic bottleneck": ["A sudden and profound reduction in the diversity of a population's gene pool, resulting from a catastrophic event or sudden isolation, where the few remaining individuals that survived the event lack sufficient genetic variation to sustain a healthy and resilient population.", "A dramatic reduction in the gene pool diversity of a species, resulting from a significant decrease in the number of individuals in a population, which can lead to a loss of genetic variation and potentially threaten the survival of the population.", "A sudden and significant reduction in the overall genetic diversity of a population, often resulting from a drastic reduction in the number of individuals that can interbreed, which can lead to a loss of genetic variation and a more uniform gene pool.", "The sudden and dramatic reduction in the diversity of a population's genetic makeup, often resulting from a catastrophic event or a dramatic change in environment, leading to the loss of genetic variation and increasing the population's susceptibility to inbreeding and reduced fitness.", "A sudden and significant reduction in genetic diversity resulting from a limited or isolated population's inability to sustain genetic variation, often leading to a homogeneous genetic profile among individuals, as if a trickle of genetic heritage had been funneled through a narrow passage, leaving a distinct genetic signature."], "phylogenetic tree": ["A visual
