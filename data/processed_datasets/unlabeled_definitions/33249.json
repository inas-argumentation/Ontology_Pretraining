displacing native species, and is capable of rapid population growth and dispersal, posing a threat to ecosystem balance and biodiversity.", "A non-native aquatic or semi-aquatic species that, having adapted to a new environment, can outcompete or displace native species for resources, often with potentially detrimental effects on the ecosystem's balance and biodiversity.", "A non-native aquatic
