impact on the natural environment, resulting in the gradual transformation of ecosystems through the introduction, spread, and adaptation of non-native species, which in turn can have a profound and lasting effect on the indigenous flora.", "The cumulative impact of human activities on a natural environment, leading to significant changes in its biological and ecological characteristics, resulting from the presence and influence of human populations, infrastructure, and activities, as observed in the Rzeszow Foothills where human settlements and economic activities have altered the

balance.", "The cumulative impact of human activities on the natural environment, which can result in a profound reshaping of ecosystems, altered species composition, and reduced biodiversity, as observed in the Rzeszow Foothills where human presence has led to a significant presence of synanthropic species."], "anthropophytes": ["A category of plants that thrive in areas strongly influenced by human activity, often exhibiting characteristics that enable them to adapt and spread rapidly in response to urbanization, agriculture, or other forms of anthropogenic impact, frequently outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems.", "Species that thrive in areas where human activity has significantly altered the natural environment, and have become dependent on these modified conditions for their survival and reproduction.", "Species of plants that thrive in environments shaped by human activity, particularly in areas where human settlement and agriculture have significantly altered the natural landscape, such as in the Rzeszow Foothills where human impact has led to a diverse but largely non-native plant community.", "Plants that thrive in areas where human activity has altered the natural environment, often dominating native species and transforming the local ecosystem.", "Species of plants that thrive and dominate in areas heavily influenced by human activities, often adapting to human-modified environments and altering native ecosystems."], "anthropogenic transformation": ["The subtle and profound changes brought about by human activities to the natural environment, characterized by a significant shift from native plant species dominance to an increasing presence of introduced and adaptable species, ultimately altering the ecological balance and biodiversity of the affected area.", "A profound alteration of a previously intact environment, precipitated by human activities and resulting in a profound shift towards a state dominated by human-influenced ecological dynamics, where the presence and distribution of native species are increasingly marginalized.", "The process by which natural environments undergo a profound and widespread alteration as a result of human activities, leading to a significant shift in the composition and structure of plant communities, and often accompanied by the introduction and establishment

aggressively displace native flora and fauna.", "The alteration of an ecosystem's natural composition and processes by human activities, leading to significant changes in the distribution and abundance of plant species, with invasive and exotic species often outcompeting native ones."], "anthropogenic impact": ["The transformation of a natural environment by the cumulative effects of human activities, leading to changes in the distribution, abundance, and composition of species, as well as the creation of novel habitats that favor the growth and spread of non-native plant species,

evidenced by the proliferation of introduced species, alteration of habitat characteristics, and increased presence of non-native flora.", "The alteration of a natural environment through human activities, resulting in a profound and lasting transformation of its flora, and often leading to the displacement or replacement of native plant species by non-native, adaptable, and invasive ones.",
