overall functioning, such as influencing nutrient cycling, modifying habitats, or serving as prey or predators, which together maintain the balance and resilience of the ecosystem.", "The subtle yet crucial patterns of ecological relationships that enable the harmonious coexistence of species in an ecosystem, where each species' presence or absence has a ripple effect on the balance and resilience of the community.", "The unique combinations of ecological tasks and processes that native species perform, which are critical for maintaining the balance and resilience of an ecosystem, and can be disrupted or replaced by invasive species as they alter the web of interactions among native and non-native organisms.", "The specific positions or functions that particular species hold

the ecosystem."], "trophic cascades": ["The sudden and unforeseen consequences that arise when the removal of a single, dominant ecological force leads to a ripple effect throughout an ecosystem, as native species and processes that were once suppressed or replaced begin to reassert themselves, potentially altering the delicate balance of a community.", "The indirect and often unpredictable consequences of altering a dynamic balance of species interactions, resulting from the manipulation of one invasive species, which can have far-reaching effects on the entire ecological network,
