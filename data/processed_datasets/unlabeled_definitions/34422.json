establishment, influenced by factors including the efficiency of seed transportation and the adaptability of the species to new environments.", "The rate at which a non-native plant species colonizes new areas, reflecting the cumulative effect of various biological and environmental factors, including its ability to generate and disseminate propagules, resist eradication, and adapt to novel

distances, regardless of their origin, and establish new populations, regardless of expert assessment or traditional risk evaluation methods."], "dispersal potential": ["The intrinsic capacity of a plant species to expand its geographic range by releasing and effectively dispersing its propagules over varying distances, independent of environmental and management factors, which ultimately determines the rate and extent of its spread.", "The measure of an organism's ability to successfully transfer its offspring or propagules to new locations, reflecting its likelihood of colonizing distant areas and adapting to diverse environments, thereby influencing its capacity for population growth and spatial expansion.", "The capacity of a species to relocate its population over space and time, driven by factors that enable its seeds or propagules to travel through the environment, regardless of the actual probability or outcome of such dispersal.", "The measure of an organism's capacity to propagate and spread into new areas, taking into account factors such as its physical characteristics and the environmental conditions it is capable of surviving in, which determines the likelihood of its successful establishment and subsequent spread.", "The capacity of a species to expand its geographic range through the movement of individuals from its original planting site to new areas, facilitated by physical attributes such as seed characteristics and vegetation structure, which influence the probability and distance of seed dispersal."], "long-distance dispersal": ["The natural transportation of plant species over extended distances, facilitated by external factors such as environmental currents or human activities, allowing them to establish populations in new areas, often leading to biological invasions.", "The process by which a species' seeds or propagules travel substantial distances, potentially spanning multiple ecosystems, without direct human intervention, thereby increasing the chances of establishment in new areas.", "The process by which seeds or propagules are carried away from their original planting site to establish a new population at a distant location, often facilitated by environmental factors such as wind, water, or animals, allowing non-native species to colonize and spread over long distances.", "The process by which viable propagules, released from a source population, travel substantial distances through environmental vectors or human-mediated activities, potentially colonizing new areas and expanding the invasive range of a species, often with significant ecological and economic implications.", "The ability of a species to disperse over extended distances, unaided by human intervention, through
