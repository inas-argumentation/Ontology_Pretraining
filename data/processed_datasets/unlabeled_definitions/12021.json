{"non-indigenous. introduction": ["The intentional or unintentional transfer of an organism from its native environment to a non-native region, which can occur through human activities such as transportation, trade, or deliberate release, and can potentially alter the ecological balance of the receiving ecosystem.", "The deliberate or unintentional arrival of a non-native species in a new habitat, often resulting from human activities, where it establishes a self-sustaining population that may or may not compete with native species for resources, altering the ecosystem dynamics.", "The intentional or unintentional transportation and establishment of a marine species in a new geographic area, often beyond its native range, which can lead to its reproduction and potential disruption of the local ecosystem.", "The deliberate or unintentional introduction of a species from outside its native range to an environment where it has not previously been present, often with potential consequences for the receiving ecosystem.", "The deliberate or accidental transplantation of a non-native species into an ecosystem where it is not historically found, which can potentially alter the native balance and pose risks to biodiversity, ecological function, or other human interests."], "manila clam": ["A species of saltwater bivalve mollusk native to the Pacific, which was intentionally introduced to British coastal waters in the 1980s, but surprisingly naturalized in numerous estuaries over the following decades, likely through unlicensed introductions and human activities, and while not currently considered a significant invasive threat, may continue to expand its range as global sea temperatures increase.", "A type of marine bivalve mollusk native to the Indo-Pacific region, which has been introduced to new habitats through human activity, often sparking controversy and debates about its potential invasive impact on local ecosystems.", "A type of marine bivalve mollusk that has been introduced to new habitats through human activities, often sparking controversy about its potential impact on local ecosystems, but in some cases, surprisingly thriving and spreading to new areas through unanticipated mechanisms.", "A marine bivalve mollusk native to Asia, previously deemed harmless for introduction to foreign waters due to concerns over climate temperature restrictions, but has since established itself in various coastal estuaries, often through unlicensed means, and is expected to continue spreading as global sea surface temperatures rise.", "A small to medium-sized marine bivalve mollusk native to the Pacific region, introduced to foreign waters where it can thrive in estuaries and adapt to changing environmental conditions, often initially exploited for aquaculture purposes but later spreading naturally through human activities or unintended dispersal, posing a potential threat to local ecosystems."], "ruditapes philipinarum": ["A tropical bivalve mollusk introduced to temperate waters, which, despite initial government assurances of its non-invasive nature, has successfully naturalized in several British estuaries through human activities, and while currently not aggressively invasive, may continue to spread with rising sea surface temperatures.", "A tropical marine bivalve mollusk native to the Philippines, known for its adaptable nature and ability to establish itself in new coastal environments, often through human activities such as intentional or unintentional introductions, with potential to gradually spread and naturalize in temperate waters.", "A type of bivalve mollusk that has been introduced to foreign waters through human activity, initially sparking controversy due to concerns about its potential invasive impact, but ultimately adapting and spreading naturally in certain areas, with its spread potentially accelerating in the future as environmental conditions change.", "A widely cultured and rapidly spreading estuarine bivalve that has been found to defy initial predictions of non-invasiveness and is now naturalized in multiple locations across Britain.", "A marine bivalve mollusk with a penchant for global travel, often introduced through intentional means, but capable of establishing wild populations through unlicensed activities or environmental factors, posing a nuanced risk to ecosystems."], "sea temperatures": ["The degree of warmth or coolness of the surface water of a body of saltwater, which plays a crucial role in determining the survival and spread of marine species, with changes in this parameter having significant implications for the ecological balance and potential impacts on native biodiversity.", "The subtle warmth that affects the behavior and distribution of marine species, playing a crucial role in determining whether certain invaders will thrive or struggle in a new environment.", "The warmth or coolness of the surface layer of the ocean, playing a crucial role in determining the viability of invasive species, such as the Manila clam, as they are introduced to new environments.", "The temperature of the coastal waters, which plays a significant role in determining the likelihood of a non-native species to establish itself and thrive in a new environment, particularly in regards to the dispersal and naturalization of marine species in British estuaries.", "The average temperature of the ocean's surface waters, often affecting the likelihood of invasive species establishment and spread in a particular region."]}
