{"tolerance evolution": ["The process by which a native plant species, in response to the presence of an invasive species, adapts to withstand the impact of novel environmental factors, such as chemical signals or other altered conditions, without succumbing to local extinction.", "The process by which native species develop the ability to withstand the subtle yet significant changes in their environment imposed by the presence of invasive species, resulting in their capacity to coexist with these invaders without suffering significant declines in fitness or local extinction.", "The adaptation of native plant species to survive and thrive in the presence of novel environmental pressures, such as chemical signals produced by invading species, without compromising their own physiological or reproductive processes, allowing for coexistence with the invader.", "The process by which a native plant species adapts to and withstands the presence of an invasive species' novel chemical defense mechanisms, which would otherwise exert a selective pressure on the native species, thereby enabling coexistence between the two species.", "The process by which native plant species develop the ability to withstand the potentially harmful effects of invasive species, thereby allowing them to coexist in the same environment without experiencing significant declines in growth,
