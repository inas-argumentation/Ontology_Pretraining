average temperature of its deepest, darkest zones, which can significantly impact the presence and abundance of certain fish species.", "The ambient aquatic environment's caloric condition, which profoundly affects the ecological balance of lake ecosystems, particularly for native species that have evolved to thrive in specific thermal regimes, yet can be altered by non-native species introductions and climate-driven temperature fluctuations.", "The warmth of the water, measured in degrees, that is a crucial factor in determining the suitability and competition for a habitat among aquatic species, where a narrow range of temperatures can provide a refuge for certain fish populations to coexist with invasive species.", "The measure of the warmth or coldness of a body of still water, which plays a crucial role in determining the distribution and abundance of aquatic species, and can have significant implications for the coexistence of native and non-native species, with higher temperatures often compressing the thermal niche of certain species and making it challenging for them to thrive."], "thermal refugia": ["Regions of a lake's environment where native species can find suitable conditions to survive and thrive, unaffected by the negative impacts of non-native species and temperature fluctuations, thereby serving as a buffer against the pressures of ecological change.", "A unique habitat feature that provides a cooler or more stable temperature zone, allowing sensitive species to thrive and maintain their distribution, abundance, and ecological interactions, thereby facilitating co-existence with potentially invasive species.", "A unique habitat feature that provides a haven for a particular species by isolating it from environmental stressors, allowing it to maintain a suitable temperature range and coexist with invasive species that would otherwise outcompete or prey on it.", "Areas of a lake where the water temperature remains cooler and more stable, providing a favorable environment for a native species to thrive, effectively buffering it against the negative impacts of invasive species and climate change.", "Areas of habitat that provide a buffer against the impacts of changing environmental conditions, allowing certain species to persist in a specific temperature range, thereby facilitating coexistence with other species that may be more sensitive to these changes."], "arctic char": ["A cold-water dweller, well adapted to inhabiting temperate lakes with a preference for depths where warm waters can't touch, and often struggling to coexist with non-native predators and competitors, its survival dependent on maintaining a thermally isolated niche.", "A species of fish that thrives in cold, pristine waters, often inhabiting deep, thermal refugia, and exhibits a strong preference for avoiding non-native predators and competitors, ultimately requiring careful conservation efforts to maintain its populations in a rapidly changing climate.", "A large, cold-water fish that thrives in pristine environments, often requiring a unique combination of chilly temperatures and minimal non-native species presence to maintain healthy populations, and is particularly susceptible to decline in shallow lakes due to their reduced thermal buffering capacity.", "A cold-water adapted fish species that thrives in pristine environments, highly sensitive to the presence of non-native species and vulnerable to habitat degradation, typically found in deep, thermally stable lakes where it can maintain its population density and ecological niche.", "A cold-water dwelling fish species that thrives in environments with a limited presence of non-native species and a consistent thermal profile, allowing it to occupy a unique ecological niche."], "perca fluviatile": ["A non-native aquatic species known for its invasive behavior and predatory capabilities, capable of significantly impacting the ecological balance of a lake and its native inhabitants, often requiring the exploitation of unique habitats to coexist with native species.", "A certain type of fish that can outcompete and prey on native species, leading to a contraction of their thermal niche and lower population densities, but may be limited in its distribution by temperature and presence of deep thermal refugia.", "A certain invasive species, known for its ability to dominate habitats and outcompete native fish species, which has been linked to the decline of Arctic char populations in certain regions.", "A species of fish notorious for invading the habitats of native char, utilizing their position as apex predators and competitors to push their native counterparts to the fringes of warmer waters, ultimately restricting their distribution and abundance.", "A certain invasive fish species known for its ability to displace native species from their habitats, primarily through competition for resources and predation, while also being tolerant of warmer water temperatures."], "eutrophication": ["The process by which the excess supply of nutrients in a lake's ecosystem overwhelms the natural balance, leading to an explosion of phytoplankton growth and subsequently altering the delicate balance of the aquatic food chain, ultimately impacting the population dynamics of native species such as Arctic char.", "The process by which a lake's nutrient-rich waters, often due to human activities or natural changes, overstimulate aquatic growth, leading to the degradation of habitats and a decline in the diversity of native species.", "The process by which the nutrient content of an ecosystem, particularly aquatic ones, is depleted or altered, potentially altering the balance of species and their
