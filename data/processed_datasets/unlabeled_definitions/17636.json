biogeographical distributions."], "non-indigenous species (nis)": ["A species that has entered a previously unfamiliar environment through human-mediated or natural means, often resulting in a significant change to the local ecological dynamics, with some populations exhibiting a capacity to expand their range and potentially outcompete native species for resources.", "Species that have migrated into a geographic area, often through human-mediated vectors such as trade routes or shipping lanes, and have established a presence distinct from their original range, potentially altering the native ecosystem and biodiversity.", "A species that has entered an ecosystem through human-mediated or natural means, such as migration or ship traffic, and is now present in an area where it is not native, potentially altering the native species community and their interactions.", "Species introduced to a new geographic region through human activities or natural processes, having a noticeable impact on the native species community, and whose presence can alter extinction probabilities and biodiversity dynamics.", "Species that have entered a region through human activity, often facilitated by intentional or unintentional human-mediated transportation, such as ship traffic or canal connectivity, and have established themselves outside their native range, potentially interacting with and affecting native species and ecosystems."], "species turnover": ["The phenomenon where the distribution of life forms in a specific region or ecosystem changes over time, resulting in an increase in novel presence, disappearance of native populations, or a dynamic balance between the two, potentially altering ecological interactions and biodiversity patterns.", "The replacement of a substantial number of biological entities with new ones over a given period, resulting in changes to the community structure and composition, often driven by human-mediated introduction and spread processes, such as canal construction and shipping activities.", "The process by which the composition of a regional or local species pool changes over time due to the influx of new, non-native species and the loss of previously recorded species, potentially altering the distribution and abundance of native species and influencing the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem.", "The process of adding or removing members from a diverse group of organisms, resulting in a dynamic and potentially modified composition, where new entrants may disrupt the balance and alter the probability of persistence for native individuals, while also potentially enriching the local or regional collection of species.", "The phenomenon of changes in the population of organisms in a given area, resulting from the arrival of new species, displacement or disappearance of existing ones, and potential alterations to the ecological dynamics, which can be influenced by natural and human-mediated processes, such as species migration, introduction through canals and shipping lanes, and taxonomic revisions."], "species pool": ["A dynamic accumulation of various components, each representing a distinct entity that has been documented to exist within a specific geographic area at some point in time, with ongoing additions and subtractions contributing to its ever-changing composition.", "The collective body of organisms known to inhabit a specific region or ecosystem, comprising both native and non-native individuals, which can fluctuate over time through natural or human-mediated processes, ultimately influencing the local biodiversity and ecological dynamics.", "A comprehensive collection of unique biological entities present within a specific geographical area, encompassing not only the diversity of resident species but also those introduced or newly recorded, which collectively contribute to shaping the ecosystem's dynamics and response to external factors.", "The aggregate collection of native and non-native marine organisms that inhabit a specific geographic region, including those that are present, extirpated, or likely to occur, and whose presence is documented through a combination of historical and contemporary records.", "A collection of unique biological entities present within a defined geographical area, comprising various
