{"marine hard-substrate": ["The oceanic zone where stationary organisms, such as coral, rocks, and kelp, form a complex structural framework that provides a habitat for a diverse array of species, and is often subject to human-induced environmental disturbances that can disrupt the delicate balance between native and non-native species.", "Areas beneath the ocean's surface where rock, coral, or other solid features provide a foundation for marine life to thrive, serving as a critical habitat where native species and non-indigenous invaders alike can settle, grow, and compete for resources.", "A complex network of underwater surfaces, often supporting a rich array of sessile invertebrates, that provide a challenging yet resilient habitat for marine species to thrive amidst the dynamic interplay of anthropogenic disturbances and native-invasive species interactions.", "A specific type of marine ecosystem characterized by rigid surfaces, such as rocks, reefs, or artificial structures, that provide habitat for a diverse array of sessile invertebrates, and are susceptible to changes in community composition and dominance caused by pollution and the introduction of non-native species.", "Areas of the seafloor that are characterized by a stable, non-sedimented surface, typically composed of rocks, reefs, or artificial structures, which provide a unique environment for the establishment of diverse and complex assemblages of sessile organisms."], "dominance": ["The extent to which a particular entity or group exercises control over a specified area or community, characterized by its ability to occupy a disproportionate amount of space, resources, and attention, often resulting in a shift away from the original ecological balance.", "The proportionate influence one group or entity exerts over a shared environment, measuring its ability to occupy available space, resources, and ecological niches, often as a result of factors such as changed environmental conditions or human activities.", "The degree to which a particular component of a community comes to occupy a disproportionate amount of spatial and functional resources, often to the exclusion or diminished presence of other components, as a result of factors such as environmental degradation or the presence of invasive species.", "The phenomenon where a group of organisms, often comprising a mixture of native and non-native species, assert a disproportionate influence over the physical space and resources within a marine ecosystem, driven by factors such as environmental degradation, human disturbance, or altered community composition, leading to changes in community structure and function.", "The state in which a particular component of a community becomes overwhelmingly prevalent, exerting a profound influence on the overall structure and dynamics of the assemblage, often accompanied by a concomitant decline in the representation and resilience of native species."], "marine pollution": ["The unintended and adverse introduction of human-made substances and activities into marine ecosystems, which can disrupt the natural balance of native species and enable the proliferation of non-indigenous invaders, ultimately threatening the ecological integrity and biodiversity of these critical environments.", "The introduction of harmful substances, activities, or factors into marine ecosystems, which can disrupt the delicate balance of native species and promote the dominance of non-native species, ultimately threatening the biodiversity and resilience of these ecosystems.", "The introduction of chemical, biological, or physical stressors to a marine ecosystem through human activities, leading to a decrease in the native species diversity and an increase in the dominance of non-native species.", "The unwanted intrusion of human activities into a marine ecosystem, leading to a decline in the dominance of indigenous species and a rise in the presence of non-native, often problematic organisms.", "The introduction of human activities and waste that disrupt the natural balance of marine ecosystems, leading to a decrease in native species diversity and an increase in the dominance of non-native species, thereby altering the composition and structure of marine hard-substrate communities."], "native diversity": ["The variety and richness of species and organisms that have evolved in a particular environment over time, characteristic of a natural ecosystem, and resistant to replacement by non-native species under normal conditions.", "The characteristic complexity and richness of an ecosystem, typically achieved through the balanced coexistence of endemic species, which are resilient and adapted to their environment, and are susceptible to decline and replacement by non-native species in the presence of anthropogenic disturbances.", "The natural state of ecological balance in a marine environment, characterized by a complex web of endemic species and native inhabitants that coexist and interact with each other in a dynamic equilibrium, which is disrupted by the presence of human-made pollutants that favor the proliferation of non-native species.", "The richness and variety of indigenous species present in a particular ecosystem, characterized by a balance of dominant and subordinate populations that coexist in harmony with their environment, unaffected by anthropogenic disturbances that can disrupt this delicate balance and favor the proliferation of non-native species.", "The composition and richness of a native ecosystem's signature species, which are the foundation of its natural balance and character, being threatened by human activities that disrupt their coexistence and allow alien species to thrive."]}
