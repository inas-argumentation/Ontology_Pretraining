its inhabitants, with a delicate balance of native and introduced species, and a pressing need for conservation efforts to mitigate the impacts of human activities.", "A remote, equatorial Pacific island ecosystem characterized by a unique native tree species, where human activities have introduced a diverse array of non-native arthropods, and whose health is under threat from the complex interactions between these introduced species and the native flora.", "A tropical Pacific archipelago characterized by a sparse, insular ecosystem where a distinct, native tree species has given way to a complex web of accidental introductions, forming a delicate balance that threatens the integrity of the atoll's unique biological heritage.", "A remote oceanic archipelago where a unique and
