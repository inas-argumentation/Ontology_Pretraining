another, ultimately threatening the balance of the affected ecosystem."], "ecosystem restoration": ["The process of reversing the negative impacts of human activities on natural environments by restoring balance to the composition and function of these systems, often requiring the intentional suppression of invasive species and the reintroduction of native species to re-establish ecological integrity and promote resilience.", "The deliberate, long-term process of reversing the disruption to native species' balance and structure in an ecosystem, by addressing the root causes of environmental degradation, and promoting the recovery of original biodiversity and ecosystem function, while also anticipating and mitigating the negative consequences of invasive species management.", "The deliberate reintroduction of a balanced and self-sustaining community of native species to an area, aiming to mitigate the impacts of invasive species and preserve the ecological integrity of the environment, often requiring targeted control measures to suppress unwanted growth forms while promoting the rapid restoration of native vegetation.", "The deliberate and systematic
