attains its maximum size and reproductive capacity, a benchmark that can vary depending on geographic location and environmental factors.", "The stage in a frog's life cycle at which it has reached a threshold level of physical development, marked by the onset of reproductive capability, and is considered a fully formed individual ready to participate in the population's ecological dynamics.", "The developmental milestone that marks the completion of critical growth stages in an organism, after which it can reproduce and thrive in its environment.", "The point in time when an individual reaches its maximum physical potential, allowing it to complete its life cycle and reproduce, which is typically influenced by factors such as geographic location, habitat quality, and food availability.", "The developmental milestone at which an individual has reached full physical stature and reproductive capability, marking the transition from youth to adult, often characterized by the attainment of maximum body size and minimal dependence on others for survival."], "age structure": ["The characteristic distribution of individual sizes and developmental stages within a population, which can reveal patterns and differences between groups, as reflected in the varying proportions of juvenile and adult frogs in different introduced populations of a species.", "The combination of demographic characteristics, such as body size and developmental stages, that describes the distribution and frequency of individuals in a population, providing insights into the population's life history and ecological dynamics.", "The distribution of individual growth and maturation stages within a population, often reflecting demographic factors such as habitat, diet, and environmental pressures, which can have significant impacts on population dynamics and ecological interactions.", "The relative proportion of organisms at different stages of growth and maturity within a population, revealing patterns of survival, reproduction, and environmental adaptation.", "The demographic distribution of a species, measured by the proportion of individuals within different life stages, providing a snapshot of the population's reproductive, growth, and mortality patterns, often influenced by environmental and ecological factors."], "american bullfrog": ["A large, invasive frog species native to eastern North America, notorious for its widespread introduction and establishment in distant continents for human consumption, characterized by its ability to thrive in diverse environments.", "A large, invasive aquatic species native to the eastern half of North America, renowned for its voracious appetite and ability to thrive in diverse environments, with a remarkable capacity to adapt to new territories through intentional introductions for food purposes.", "A large, voracious amphibian native to eastern North America, infamous for its invasive capabilities and widely introduced for culinary purposes, often reaching impressive sizes and exhibiting little discernible sexual dimorphism.", "A large, invasive frog species originating from the eastern half of North America, renowned for its rapid colonization of introduced habitats and notable for its distinct skeletochronological features that have been extensively studied in introduced populations.", "A large, voracious semi-aquatic frog native to a significant portion of North America, notorious for its remarkable adaptability and invasive tendencies, leading to its establishment in numerous regions around the world."], "introduced population": ["A group of animals that have been transported from their original geographic range to a new area, often for human benefit, and are now thriving in an alien environment.", "A group of individuals of a species that has been transferred to a geographic area outside of its original range, often for human purposes such as food or recreation, and has since established a self-sustaining population.", "A group of individuals from a non-native species that have been intentionally or unintentionally released into a new geographical area, often resulting in an impact on the local ecosystem, and are now thriving and reproducing in their new environment.", "A group of individuals of a non-native species that have been intentionally or unintentionally established in a new geographic area, often through human activity, and are thriving or persisting in their new environment.", "A group of organisms of a non-native species that have been relocated by human activity from their natural range to an area where they would not normally be found, such as for the purpose of food, and have established a self-sustaining population."],
