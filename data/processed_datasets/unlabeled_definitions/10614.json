{"bayesian statistics": ["A quantitative approach that allows scientists to rigorously evaluate the likelihood of a hypothesis by incorporating uncertainty and updating their findings through the analysis of multiple datasets, much like how the impact of introducing a specific number of invaders on an ecosystem's equilibrium is assessed to better understand the determinants of successful biological invasions.", "A statistical framework that allows for the quantification of uncertainty by weaving together prior knowledge and new data, ultimately providing a precise understanding of the relationships between variables, such as the propagule pressure and establishment success of alien species.", "A method for statistically dissecting the intricacies of complex biological phenomena by quantifying the likelihood of different outcomes based on the number of individuals or observations, allowing researchers to tease apart the underlying relationships and make informed predictions about the success of alien species establishment.", "A quantitative approach that uses a collaborative, iterative process between data and prior assumptions to distill uncertainty and tease out patterns from disparate observations, ultimately revealing a consistent narrative across diverse contexts, such as the relationship between an initial population size and the success of an invasive species.", "The process of quantitatively weighing the collective evidence of multiple observations or studies, utilizing an iterative approach that updates our understanding of a relationship, phenomenon, or probability, thereby refining our understanding and producing more accurate predictions."], "establishment success": ["The degree to which a newly introduced species is able to sustain itself and grow in its novel environment, ultimately resulting in a viable and thriving population.", "The degree to which a novel entity, introduced into a previously uninhabited or undisturbed environment, is able to persist and thrive, often requiring a critical minimum number of founders to achieve a self-sustaining population.", "The achievement of a foothold or stable presence by a non-native species in a new environment, resulting from the successful introduction and propagation of a sufficient number of individuals to overcome initial challenges and ensure long-term persistence.", "The successful transition of an introduced species from an initial introduction to a self-sustaining population, often characterized by a critical number of founding individuals that can adapt, reproduce, and persist in the novel environment.", "The degree to which a non-native species achieves a sustainable presence in a new environment, often dependent on the number of individuals initially introduced."], "null model": ["A statistical framework that disregards the impact of specific factors on a biological phenomenon, serving as a baseline against which the importance of other variables can be measured, and in the context of species invasions, provides a standardized reference point for evaluating the relative influence of factors that contribute to the establishment success of alien species.", "A statistical framework that describes the expected patterns and relationships between variables in the absence of any significant biological or ecological influence, often serving as a baseline for testing hypotheses and evaluating the significance of empirical findings.", "A statistical concept used to describe a hypothetical scenario where there is no inherent relationship or pattern between variables, with all outcomes being equally likely and uninformative, serving as a baseline for comparing the observed patterns and trends in real-world data, especially in the context of invasive species establishment where it provides a foundation for examining the factors influencing population success.", "A theoretical framework that predicts the likelihood of a species establishing a self-sustaining population in a new environment based on the number of individuals introduced, often assuming no other factors influence this process.", "A theoretical construct that serves as a benchmark for understanding the determinants of a phenomenon, representing the absence of any specific influence or driving force, thus providing a baseline against which the effects of various factors can be measured and quantified."]}
