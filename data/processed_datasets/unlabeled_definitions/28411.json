from smaller shrub species, which can either facilitate or hinder the regeneration process.", "The process by which a stand of trees or other vegetation recovers or restocks itself through the growth and establishment of new individuals, often affected by the actions of large herbivores that browse on its canopy and understorey, leading to altered community composition and potentially impacting the long-term health and resilience of the ecosystem.", "The process by which a forest's youthful growth and replenishment occur, resulting in a renewed or restored canopy of tree cover, with the potential for diverse understory vegetation to flourish, and where the interplay between browsing dynamics, seedling establishment, and competitive interactions among vegetation types shape the outcome.", "The natural recovery or renewal process of a forest ecosystem, wherein the growth and development of new vegetation, including seedlings, saplings, and mature trees, is enabled or hindered by various biotic and abiotic factors, such as browsing pressure, soil conditions, and light competition.", "The process by which ecosystems, such as temperate forests, recover from disturbances or degradation, characterized by the establishment of new vegetation, the growth of existing trees, and the recolonization of disturbed areas, which can be influenced by factors such as herbivory,
