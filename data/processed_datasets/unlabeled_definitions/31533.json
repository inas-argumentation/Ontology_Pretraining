{"one health": ["A comprehensive approach to understanding and addressing the interconnected health and well-being of humans, animals, and the environment, recognizing that the health of one component is deeply linked to the health of the others, and that coordinated efforts across disciplines are necessary to mitigate the risks and consequences of emerging threats.", "The recognition that the well-being of humans, animals, and the ecosystem are intricately linked, and that understanding and addressing the interdependencies between these components is essential for promoting overall health and sustainability.", "The interconnected understanding and holistic approach to understanding and addressing the complex relationships between human health, the health of the animal kingdom, and the health of the ecosystems in which they coexist, recognizing that the well-being of each is deeply connected and that addressing threats to one aspect has far-reaching implications for the others.", "The recognition that the intricate web of relationships between humans, animals, and the environment demands an interdisciplinary approach that considers the interconnectedness of health, ecology, and ecosystem function in order to mitigate the risks and consequences of emerging infectious diseases and biological invasions.", "The interdependent and dynamic relationship between the well-being of human populations, the health of animal and plant species, and the integrity of ecosystems, which recognizes that threats to one component inevitably impact others, and thus requires a holistic approach to mitigate and manage risks, ensuring a sustainable future for all."], "emerging diseases": ["The sudden and rapid expansion of an organism's range or abundance, often facilitated by human activities, into novel environments or ecosystems, where it can potentially interact with new hosts, vectors, or ecological niches, posing a threat to public health, ecosystem balance, and biodiversity.", "The sudden and widespread dissemination of organisms that originated from human- mediated interactions, often facilitated by environmental change, geographic barriers, and evolutionary adaptations, resulting in the unpredictable and potentially devastating impact on global health, ecosystem stability, and human well-being.", "The sudden and unanticipated proliferation of a previously geographically limited or underrepresented biological entity, facilitated by human activity, environmental change, or a combination of both, resulting in a previously unforeseen impact on human, animal, and ecosystem well-being.", "The rapid spread of pathogens or disease-carrying organisms across geographical boundaries, driven by a combination of human activities, environmental changes, and evolutionary pressures, resulting in unexpected outbreaks or epidemics that pose a threat to human, animal, and ecosystem health.", "The rapid increase in geographic distribution or abundance of an organism, driven by a combination of human-mediated dispersal, evolutionary adaptation, and environmental change, resulting in unforeseen consequences for human health, animal health, and ecosystem well-being."], "emerging infectious diseases": ["A phenomenon characterized by the rapid spread or rapid rise in abundance of a previously non-threatening organism in a given ecosystem, often driven by human activities and facilitated by environmental changes, which can have significant consequences for the health of humans, animals, and the ecosystem as a whole.", "Organisms that exhibit rapid, global dissemination and altered ecological dynamics, precipitating adverse impacts on human health, animal well-being, and environmental sustainability.", "Rapidly spreading health threats that result from the intersection of human, animal, and environmental factors, often enabled by geographic, ecological, or evolutionary changes that disrupt the balance between species and their ecosystems.", "A novel or resurging threat to public health caused by the rapid dispersal or evolution of an organism, often facilitated by human activities, and resulting in significant harm to human, animal, and ecosystem well-being.", "The rapid and unexpected spread of microorganisms that have adapted to thrive in novel environmental or ecological contexts, often facilitated by human activity and capable of causing significant harm to human, animal, and ecosystem health."], "human health": ["The condition of an individual's physical and mental well-being, influenced by the intricate relationships between their own biology, the natural world, and the global ecological and societal systems they inhabit, with the capacity to affect and be affected by the health of those around them, and the ecosystems that sustain them.", "The harmonious balance and resilience of individuals' bodily systems, lifestyle choices, and environmental connections, allowing for adaptability and sustenance in the face of ever-changing circumstances.", "The dynamic interaction between an individual's biology and their surroundings, shaped by environmental factors, population movements, and ecological pressures, which influences their susceptibility to and recovery from disruptions to their well-being, ultimately determining their ability to thrive and contribute to the overall vitality of their community.", "The condition of optimal well-being and resilience that arises from the harmonious interplay between the human body, the organisms it interacts with, and the environments it inhabits.", "The state of harmonious coexistence between a person's physiological and psychological well-being, the natural world, and the microorganisms that inhabit it, where the individual's health is intimately connected to the health of the planet and its other inhabitants."]}
