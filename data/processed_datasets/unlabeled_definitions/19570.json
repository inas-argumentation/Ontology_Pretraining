sensitive or rare plant species.", "A phenomenon in which a non-native, burrowing invertebrate species alters the physical and chemical properties of the soil, potentially leading to changes in soil nutrient availability, plant community composition, and ecological processes, with cascading effects on the demography and survival of rare plant species in forest ecosystems.", "A phenomenon where non-native invertebrates colonize and accumulate in areas previously uninhabited by them, potentially disrupting native ecosystems by altering soil nutrient dynamics and promoting changes in plant community composition.", "A phenomenon where non-native invertebrate burrowers establish populations in native soil ecosystems, altering local nutrient cycles and potentially influencing the growth and survival of native plant species through both direct and indirect mechanisms.", "The process by which a type of below-ground organism, often introduced to a ecosystem from another region,
