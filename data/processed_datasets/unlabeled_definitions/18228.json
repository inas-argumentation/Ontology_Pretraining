growth, disturbance frequency, and ecosystem dynamics, often tipped by the arrival of a highly adaptable and vigorous species, which in turn influences the likelihood and intensity of a particular

determines the characteristics of an invasive plant species and its potential to thrive in different environmental conditions, particularly in response to climate change and competition from native vegetation.", "The original location from which plant material is collected, typically referring to a specific geographical area or ecological setting that influences the characteristics and adaptability of the plant, thereby affecting its performance in a different environment.", "The genetic material derived from the parents of a plant species, originating from a specific geographic location and characterized by unique adaptations to local environmental conditions, influencing the offspring's ability to thrive in the same or nearby areas.", "The specific genetic material collected from a particular region, which determines the adaptability and subsequent performance of a plant population in that environment."], "elevation gradient": ["A gradual increase or decrease in environmental conditions, such as temperature, vegetation, and precipitation, across a specific region, which can influence the growth and spread of invasive plant species.", "A terrain feature characterized by a gradual change in environmental conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, and vegetation, as one moves from a higher region to a lower one, where the impact of climate change on invasive plant species, like cheatgrass, can be studied in a continuous and varied manner.", "A gradual variation in environmental conditions, typically including temperature, precipitation, and vegetation, that occurs in a specific region over a distance, resulting in distinct changes to the distribution, abundance, and behavior of plant species.", "A range of landscapes traversed by a researcher, featuring varying conditions that influence plant growth and diversity, with differences in temperature, moisture, and vegetation composition that create a gradient of suitable and unsuitable habitats for a particular invasive species.", "A measure of distance from the base of a landscape that captures the varied environmental conditions that shape plant populations, with increasing distance often associated with changes in temperature, precipitation, and vegetation structure that can influence the growth and spread of invasive species."], "grassland invasion": ["The rapid and dominant colonization of previously disturbed or altered habitats by a non-native plant species, often accompanied by changes to local ecosystems and potentially exacerbated by environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation.", "The process by which a non-native, highly adaptable and competitive plant species gradually outcompetes and displaces native vegetation, altering ecosystem composition and potentially leading to a proliferation of biomass and altered fire regimes in response to environmental changes, ultimately reshaping the landscape's ecological dynamics.",
