its survival and reproduction.", "The behavioral adaptation of a species to optimize its access to food and shelter resources within a given environment, often influenced by both spatial and temporal factors.", "The spatial and temporal distribution of an invasive species' foraging activities, shelter seeking behaviors, and overall environmental interactions, which is influenced by factors such as vegetation structure and temperature, ultimately driving its population's adaptation and survival in an invaded ecosystem.", "The act of a species exploiting its environment to meet its physiological and behavioral needs, characterized by the selection of specific areas or microsites that optimize the availability of resources, such as food, shelter, and thermoregulation, while minimizing exposure to unfavorable conditions.", "The ecological behavior of a species that involves selecting and utilizing specific environmental settings to optimize its biological needs, such as sustenance and thermal regulation, while minimizing exposure to unfavorable conditions."], "habitat selection": ["The process by which an invasive species adjusts its distribution and behavioral patterns to optimize the availability of resources, such as food and shelter, while minimizing exposure to environmental stressors, ultimately facilitating its establishment and survival in a new biome.", "The process by which an invasive species chooses specific environmental settings that optimize its survival and reproductive potential, often prioritizing food availability and thermal comfort.", "The process by which an animal adapts its spatial distribution to optimize energy intake, comfort, and survival within its environment, often driven by a prioritization of food availability and a mitigation of extreme conditions.", "The process by which an invasive species optimizes its survival and reproduction by selectively occupying areas that provide the most favorable conditions for feeding and minimizing exposure to undesirable environmental factors.", "The process by which animals optimize their environmental conditions to maximize food availability and minimize exposure to extreme
