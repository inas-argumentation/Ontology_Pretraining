biological regulators that keep pest populations in check.", "The deliberate use of natural enemies or mechanisms that occur within the environment to regulate or manage the populations of pests,

presence, and can be controlled or managed through the use of conservation and augmentation strategies involving plant-based habitats and selective mesh filters.", "A small, usually hidden, insect

environment, threatening to disrupt the delicate balance of nature and leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.", "A non-native, small, and destructive insect pest that ravages horse chestnut leaves, threatening the health and appearance of its host plant, and whose population growth can be mitigated by introducing its natural predators through innovative conservation and augmentation
