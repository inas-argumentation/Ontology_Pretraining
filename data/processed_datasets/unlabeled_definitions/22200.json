populations, taking into account the relative abundance of each species within the community, with a higher score indicating a greater correspondence between the two communities.", "The Sorensen similarity index measures the degree of botanical overlap between two communities, capturing the proportion of common species found in both communities, while also taking into account the relative

invasive species, by comparing the proportion of shared species and their relative abundance.", "The similarity between two ecological communities can be measured by calculating the proportion of plant species that are common to both, taking into account the relative abundance of each species, thus providing a nuanced understanding of their compositional similarity.", "A mathematical

species' abundance is relatively balanced and uniform, indicating a harmonious coexistence among its components.", "The uniformity of coexistence among a community's constituent elements, reflecting the relative balance of their abundance, distribution, and ecological roles, with implications for the overall resilience and functionality of the ecosystem.", "The distribution of a community's species in relation to their abundance, where a balanced spread of populations at varying levels suggests a stable and healthy ecosystem, whereas an uneven distribution may indicate a disproportionate
