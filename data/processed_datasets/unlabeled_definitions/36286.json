pathways.", "Vast, majestic waterways carving through untouched wilderness, supporting intricate food chains where native species harmoniously coexist with introduced predators, which, in turn, dramatically reshape the ecosystem."], "macroinvertebrates": ["The small to moderate-sized organisms that live in or on the bottom of aquatic ecosystems, playing a crucial role in decomposing organic matter and serving as a vital food source for various species, including fish and other invertebrates.", "Small and large aquatic animals, other than fish, that play a crucial role in the food chain of a river's ecosystem, and can be characterized by their diversity and complexity in certain river sections, such as filamentous algae-dominated areas.", "Small to medium-sized, often overlooked,

organisms in river ecosystems, and whose diversity can indicate the complexity and health of a river's food web."], "rainbow trout": ["A cold-water dwelling, opportunistic feeder that exhibits a peculiar duality, being both a prominent predator and a dominant competitor in its native and introduced ranges, often thriving in the base of food webs where its adaptable appetite can shift from consuming basal resources to feeding on other fish.", "A widely distributed, invasive finned predator that exhibits flexible feeding habits, shifting from feeding on small organisms to competing with and preying on other fish in certain aquatic environments.", "A prolific and adaptable species of fish, native to certain regions, that can exhibit a versatile role in food webs, shifting from a consumer of invertebrates to a competitor and predator as it matures, and which can have a significant impact on local ecosystems when introduced to new areas.", "A species of fish known for its adaptability and ability to occupy a wide range of ecological niches, from foraging on small invertebrates to competing with top predators for resources.", "A brightly colored, adaptable fish species that can thrive in a variety of aquatic environments, occasionally adopting a duality in its ecological role, vacillating between being a consumer and a predator, and sometimes playing a crucial but competitive role in the balance of a river's food web, while simultaneously occupying a prominent position in the trophic hierarchy."], "fish": ["A species of aquatic animal that inhabits a particular type of habitat and occupies a specific position within its ecosystem's food web, often characterized by a carnivorous diet and adaptations for survival in a watery environment.", "Cold-blooded,
