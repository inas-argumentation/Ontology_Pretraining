and germinate, often employed to overcome dormancy and improve germination rates in ecotypes of native perennial grasses.", "The process of modifying the outermost layer of a seed to facilitate germination, often involving the removal or manipulation of a natural barrier that prevents the seed from absorbing water and nutrients, allowing it to more readily sprout and grow.", "The process of mechanically altering the outer layer of a seed to stimulate germination, often achieved through gentle abrasion or mechanical removal of the seed's outer covering, allowing for increased water uptake and subsequent growth.", "A process of carefully manipulating the outermost layer of a dormant seed to facilitate its absorption of water and nutrients, allowing it to break dormancy and sprout, which is particularly important for native grasses that require specialized treatment to overcome their natural resistance to germination."], "seed germination": ["The initial stage of a seed's life cycle, where it breaks dormancy and begins to sprout, resulting in the emergence of a new plant, typically involving the removal of barriers or the alteration of seed structure to facilitate this process.", "The process by which dormant grass seeds become biologically active, releasing their stored energy to emerge as sprouts, which is often hindered by physical barriers such as lemma and palea, but can be improved through mechanical removal or chemical treatment.", "The process by which a dormant plant reproduction unit, freed from physical barriers, begins to grow and develop into a new plant, often requiring specific environmental conditions and treatment to initiate successful development.", "The process by which dormant seeds become viable and emerge into new life, often requiring removal of physical barriers or modification of seed structures to facilitate successful establishment.", "The process by which dormant grass seeds break down their natural barriers and initiate growth, ultimately developing into a new plant, which is often enhanced by treatments that remove or modify specific seed structures and can be affected by temperature and light fluctuations."], "seed viability": ["The proportion of plant reproductive units that exhibit the ability to sprout and develop into healthy individuals, determined by assessing the percentage of units that can be triggered to germinate under optimal conditions, and is a critical factor in predicting the success of a seed-based restoration or reintroduction effort.", "The quality of a grass seed's ability to yield a viable and healthy crop of seedlings, typically measured by the proportion of seeds that successfully germinate and grow under optimal conditions.", "The proportion of seed lots that are capable of germinating, taking into account factors such as dormancy and physical barriers, ultimately determining their ability to successfully initiate plant growth and development.", "The percentage of seeds in a sample that are capable of successfully initiating the germination process, as determined by their ability to sprout and grow when provided with suitable environmental conditions.", "The percentage of dormant seeds in a seed lot that, when treated with specific conditions, are capable of successfully transitioning into the germination process, ultimately resulting in the emergence of a healthy seedling."], "seed coat": ["The outermost layer of a seed that encases its inner contents, often characterized by its ability to hinder germination until removed or modified through various means, allowing the seedling to emerge and thrive.", "The outer, protective layer of a seed that surrounds the inner reproductive structures, often containing dormant seeds that require removal or manipulation to trigger germination in certain species of grasses.", "The outermost, protective layer of a seed that can harbor dormancy-inducing features, such as hard outer coverings, which require
