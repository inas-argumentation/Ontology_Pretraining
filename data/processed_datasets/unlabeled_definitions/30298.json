{"laminariales": ["A group of brown seaweeds characterized by their distinctive lamina-like growth habit, often introduced to new regions through human activity, where they can thrive and establish non-native populations.", "An order of brown algae characterized by their distinctive ribbon-like shape, which has been known to colonize and thrive in non-native habitats, such as those found in temperate coastal waters of northern Spain.", "A group of brown algae that includes species commonly found in temperate and sub-Arctic waters, characterized by their long, flat, and often serrated blades that thrive in dense aggregations, sometimes with invasive potential, on rocky substrates and in coastal areas.", "A group of algae characterized by their long, flat blades and ability to form dense underwater forests, often found in coastal regions where human activities have inadvertently facilitated their spread.", "A group of marine brown algae that have a specific type of structural organization, characterized by an elongated shape and a tendency to thrive in coastal areas where they can readily spread and colonize new environments."], "introduced seaweed": ["A non-native species of marine algae that has colonized an area outside its natural range, potentially altering the local ecosystem, and has often been transported to the new location through human activity, as in the case of an intentional or unintentional introduction.", "A non-native marine algae that has been transported and settled outside its natural range, often through human activity, and is now established in a new location, potentially altering the native ecosystem.", "A marine plant that has been unintentionally or intentionally introduced to an ecosystem outside its native range, often with the potential to displace native species and alter the local environment.", "A type of marine plant that has been inadvertently or intentionally transported to a new region, where it is not native, and has since established a self-sustaining population, often causing ecological changes and competing with indigenous species.", "A type of marine alga that originates from a different geographic location and has established a self-sustaining population in a new area, often through human activity or natural dispersal, and can potentially outcompete native species for resources."], "undaria pinnatidida": ["A non-native marine algae that has colonized areas outside of its original habitat, often causing ecological changes and competition with native species.", "A type of non-native, invasive seaweed that has been introduced to new regions through human activity, often establishing itself in coastal areas and altering local ecosystems.", "A type of seaweed that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to non-native areas, often outcompeting native species and altering ecosystems, with the Cantabrian Sea being one of the latest regions affected.", "A non-native, introduced marine algae species that has become established in a new geographical area, particularly in the northeastern region of the Iberian Peninsula, where it has been observed to thrive in a specific coastal region known for its rich biodiversity.", "A non-native seaweed species native to Asia, now established in the Cantabrian Sea, known for its striking appearance and ability to thrive in new environments, slowly expanding its presence along the Spanish coastline."]}
