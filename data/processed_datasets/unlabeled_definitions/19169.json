situation in which a non-native species successfully adapts to and becomes a natural part of a new ecosystem, often as a result of human activity, and is now able to survive and potentially thrive independently of its original geographic range.", "A process of becoming self-sustaining and widespread in a new region, often following initial introduction by human transportation, whereby a species adapts and thrives despite being outside its native biogeographic realm.", "The process by which an introduced species becomes a permanent and self-sustaining component of a new ecosystem, often
