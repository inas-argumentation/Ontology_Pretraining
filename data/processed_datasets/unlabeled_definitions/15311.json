existence is threatened by the quiet yet insidious invasion of non-native species in its natural habitats, yet remains resilient in the face of adversity."], "introduced frogs": ["Species of aquatic amphibians that have been deliberately or accidentally transported to a new geographic region, often for human consumption or as exotic pets, and have subsequently established populations in the wild,

for survival, growth, and reproduction, often influenced by physical and biological factors, and resulting in a non-random distribution of individuals within their environment.", "The process by which species occupying a shared ecological niche adaptively allocate their populations across different spatial environments, often driven by preferences for specific resource availability, predator avoidance, or reproductive success, thereby influencing their coexistence and potentially shaping the distribution of multiple species within an ecosystem.", "The process by which a species chooses to occupy specific areas within a larger environment, often in response to various environmental factors and interactions with other species, ultimately determining the distribution and abundance of the species within its range.", "The process by which species choose specific environmental conditions, such as water quality, vegetation, or physical features, in which to reside, feed, and reproduce,
