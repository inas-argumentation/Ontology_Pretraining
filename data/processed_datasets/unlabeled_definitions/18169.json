environmental factors that can impact the population's ability to maintain its genetic integrity."], "isolation management": ["The practice of safeguarding indigenous populations by physically disconnecting them from the rest of their kind, often through habitat modification or fragmentation, thereby reducing the risk of adverse interactions with non-native species and mitigating the loss

local extinction.", "The deliberate strategy of separating or separating-off segments of a threatened species' habitat to preserve its genetic integrity, often in response to the presence of invasive species or other ecological threats, thereby protecting the population from potential declines in fitness due to inbreeding and hybridization, while allowing local adaptation to continue unabated.", "The strategic separation and protection of native species from invasive interactions to preserve their genetic integrity, often necessitating a trade-off between population connectivity and conservation success.", "The deliberate separation of native species from invasive or non-native populations to protect their genetic integrity and reduce the risk of hybridization and population

vitality.", "A cold-water fish species widely distributed in North America, characterized by its fragile genetic makeup, vulnerability to inbreeding, and tendency to exhibit reduced allelic richness over time in isolated populations, often found in fragmented habitats.", "A freshwater fish species characterized by its fragmented population structure, often found in isolated habitats, which has been shaped by a complex interplay of natural geological processes and human activities.", "A native aquatic species, widely distributed across North America, characterized by its endemic nature and

characterized by its tendency to thrive in isolated aquatic habitats, where it has adapted to survive and reproduce in fragmented environments, often at the cost of genetic diversity and increased susceptibility to inbreeding depression, yet still capable of resisting invasion by non-native species due to its isolation."], "inbreeding depression": ["The reduction in evolutionary fitness and adaptability of a population resulting from the decreased genetic diversity caused by the concentration of inherited traits and increased similarity between individuals, leading to a heightened vulnerability to ecological pressures and diminished capacity for survival in the face of environmental changes.", "The decline in the health and fitness of a population that results from the cumulative effects of genetic traits being perpetuated and amplified through generations of repeated mating within a closed and isolated group, often leading to a reduction in the population's overall

reduction in the ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and resist disease, ultimately increasing the risk of local extinction.", "The progressive decline in population health and
