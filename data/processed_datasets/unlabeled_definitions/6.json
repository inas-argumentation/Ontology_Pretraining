migrated there via human activity, and exhibits a distribution pattern that is anomalous from its native habitat, with no documented presence in the area prior to such introduction.", "A species that originates from a foreign geographic region and is unintentionally introduced to a new environment through human activities, such as maritime trade, and establishes a self-sustaining population, often with unknown or unpredictable ecological consequences."], "mediterranean sea": ["A semi-enclosed body of water, generally characterized by its proximity to landmasses and unique blend of Atlantic and Eastern influences, featuring a range of habitats including coastal areas and bays, where marine species of varying origins and densities can thrive.", "A semi-enclosed sea with a range of salinity

from external regions via ship traffic.", "A semi-enclosed sea located between three continents, characterized by a unique blend of oceanic and freshwater influences, featuring distinct regional variations in terms of salinity, currents, and marine life, and often affected by human activities such as shipping and aquaculture, which can impact its ecological balance and biodiversity.", "A region of salty waters located between two continents, characterized by diverse marine life and a history of being shaped by maritime trade and cultural exchange, with certain areas hosting unique biodiversity due to the influx of foreign species through human activities.", "A semi-enclosed sea, typically characterized by high salinity and unique biodiversity, with a complex coastline and connections to the open ocean, featuring a specific assemblage of marine organisms that may have originated from distant regions and been introduced through human activity, such as ship traffic, and
