effective management and eradication strategies to prevent further spread.", "Arboreal mammals of specific genus, often traded as exotic pets, whose introduction and establishment in non-native habitats can lead to biological invasions, competing with native species and posing risks to human health through disease transmission."], "callosciurus spp.": ["A type of arboreal rodent characterized by its invasive nature, often introduced to new habitats through the exotic pet trade, where it can outcompete native species and pose a risk to human health through its potential role as a vector for infectious diseases.", "Tiny, arboreal mammals, often traded as exotic pets, with a remarkable ability to adapt and thrive in non-native habitats, potentially disrupting local ecosystems, spreading diseases, and challenging species identification and management.", "A group of arboreal mammals, often sought after as exotic pets, that have been introduced through human activity to areas outside their native range, resulting in biological invasions that can have significant ecological and public health implications.", "Tiny, arboreal mammals often brought into the pet trade, which, when released or introduced to new habitats, can wreak havoc on ecosystems, outcompete native species, and even spread diseases to humans.", "A species of tree-dwelling rodents introduced through the exotic pet trade, posing a significant threat to native ecosystems and human health, and requiring a collaborative effort to detect, monitor, and manage their populations in a way that balances conservation goals with social, political, and economic factors."], "exotic pet trade": ["The commerce and circulation of non-native, often wild-caught or hybrid, animals from diverse biomes, which are traded and kept as companions, often with unintended consequences, such as the introduction and establishment of invasive populations, disruption of native ecosystems, and potential health risks to humans and animals alike.", "The commerce of non-indigenous animals, often captured or bred for their unique characteristics or appearance, which are then released into new environments, resulting in unintended ecological consequences and the displacement of native species.", "The trade of non-native, non-domesticated animals, often captivating in appearance, which are imported for human companionship, but may ultimately be released or escape into the wild, subsequently colonizing new areas and potentially threatening native ecosystems, human health, and local economies.", "The global commercial and unofficial transfer of non-native, often charismatic, wild animals that are sought for their novelty, aesthetic appeal, or perceived charm, leading to their release into the environment and potentially establishing self-sustaining populations that disrupt ecological balance and pose a threat to native species and human health.", "The illicit and regulated commerce of wild, non-domesticated, and unusual animals, characterized by the capture and keeping of species from other regions for private enjoyment, often resulting in accidental or intentional releases that lead to invasive populations."], "invasive alien species management": ["The coordinated and multi-faceted effort to mitigate and contain the ecological and health impacts of non-native animals that have established wild populations, through a combination of early detection, species identification, monitoring, and control measures, while taking into account the complex social, economic, and political factors that influence their management, and involving diverse stakeholders to build a consensus on effective and sustainable actions.", "The deliberate attempt to control and mitigate the ecological, economic, and social impacts of non-native species that establish themselves in new environments, thereby preserving the integrity of local ecosystems and protecting human health, while navigating the complex web of public opinion, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive management strategies.", "The proactive and multi-faceted process of mitigating and controlling the spread of non-native, non-domesticated animals that establish self-sustaining populations, potentially disrupting native ecosystems and posing threats to human health and well-being.", "The proactive and comprehensive approach to mitigating the negative impacts of non-native animals that have been released or intentionally introduced into an ecosystem, including their potential to establish self-sustaining populations, disrupt native species' habitats, and pose risks to human health, by integrating detection and monitoring strategies, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive management decisions to prevent or control the spread of these unwanted organisms.", "The process of detecting, monitoring, and controlling non-native species that harm ecosystems and human health, requiring a multifaceted approach that considers biological, social, political, and economic factors to mitigate their impact on native species, human well-being, and the environment, while engaging stakeholders and fostering consensus on effective management strategies."], "exotic pets": ["Non-domesticated animals acquired through international commerce or trade, often kept as pets, which may have a potential to establish feral populations and disrupt local ecosystems, compromising native species and potentially even human health.", "Non-domesticated and arboreal animals of non-native origin, often kept as companions or curiosities, that have the potential to establish feral populations and disrupt ecological balances through their unintended releases or escapes.", "Mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and birds that are not native to a region and are kept as companions by humans, which may be released or establish populations in the wild, disrupting the natural balance and potentially
