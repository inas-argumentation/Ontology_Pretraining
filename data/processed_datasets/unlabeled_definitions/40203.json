variety of environments and sometimes overlooked despite being native to a particular region."], "daudebardia": ["A type of gastropod that dwells in areas rich in nutrients, where it sustains itself by consuming a significant portion of its diet.", "A type of gastropod that, despite being native to a region, remains surprisingly unnoticed by the scientific community, perhaps due to its subtle

diet and a somewhat overlooked native status, often living in close proximity to agricultural environments.", "A semi-slug-like, carnivorous gastropod native to certain regions, characterized by its short snout and often overlooked presence in its natural habitat.", "A type of land snail that exhibits a unique dual nature, combining the traits of a sluggish pace with a surprising carnivorous appetite, often overlooked in its natural habitat."], "semi-slugs": ["Gastropod mollusks that exhibit a mix of characteristics typically associated with both snails and slugs, such as a shell that is reduced or absent, but still retain some morphological features that differentiate them from their fully shell-less relatives.", "A group of terrestrial gastropod mollusks characterized by their tendency to abandon shell-forming, but still exhibit certain residual shell-like features, often accompanied by a diet consisting mainly of animal-based substances, resulting in a lifestyle that balances the loss of protective armor with the benefits of increased mobility and adaptability.", "Species characterized by their unique blend of gastropod and pulmonate features, which enable them to thrive in environments where their more traditional, fully slotted counterparts would struggle to survive, often resulting in a distinct ecological niche.", "A type of terrestrial gastropod that, despite lacking a fully formed shell, exhibits carnivorous tendencies and is often classified as an intermediate form between true slugs and snails, yet remains remarkably understudied in its native range.", "A type of terrestrial gastropod mollusk that, although not truly limbless, exhibits reduced or absent shell development, often relying on its flesh to protect its internal organs, and is typically found in environments where its slender body is well-suited to navigate."], "belgium": ["A country nestled in the heart of Western Europe, home to a rich biodiversity, where a fascinating semi-slug, often overlooked, quietly inhabits the soil, its existence a testament to the region's ecological complexity.", "A region in Northwest Europe where a fascinating array of terrestrial
