community's composition is distributed uniformly among species, allowing each species to occupy a stable niche and coexist with others, without one species dominating to the point of suppressing others, thus maintaining ecological harmony.", "The proportional representation of a community's constituent parts, where a balanced distribution of elements ensures a sense of cohesion and stability,
