{"acute thermal tolerance": ["The ability of an organism to withstand a brief, intense exposure to elevated water temperatures without sustaining significant harm or mortality, a trait that is often studied in ideal laboratory conditions but may not accurately reflect the organism's response to prolonged or recurring temperature stress in its natural environment.", "The ability of an organism to withstand brief periods of elevated temperature without harm, often assessed under ideal laboratory conditions, and is typically measured by the highest temperature that can be sustained without causing immediate mortality.", "The ability of an organism to withstand high temperatures for a short duration, typically within a few hours or days, without suffering significant harm, but only under optimal conditions that ensure maximum physiological functioning.", "The ability of an organism to withstand extreme temperatures without harm, typically evident in short-term laboratory experiments that simulate sudden and brief exposure to elevated temperatures, often revealing a higher level of tolerance than might be expected under natural conditions.", "The ability of an organism to withstand short-term exposure to elevated water temperatures without succumbing to stress or mortality, typically under optimal environmental conditions, such as ideal food availability, water quality, and other factors."], "chronic thermal tolerance": ["The ability of an organism to withstand prolonged exposure to temperatures that are not immediately lethal, but can still have significant impacts on its survival, growth, and reproductive potential over an extended period.", "The ability of an organism to sustain its physiological processes and maintain its population viability over extended periods of time in the face of gradually increasing temperatures, often exhibiting tolerance to acute heat shocks, but ultimately succumbing to cumulative heat stress that impairs its capacity to reproduce, grow, and adapt to changing environmental conditions.", "The ability of an organism to withstand repeated and prolonged exposure to temperature fluctuations that may not cause immediate harm, but can ultimately lead to mortality or impairment, often as a result of accumulation over time.", "The ability of an organism to withstand prolonged periods of temperatures that may not be lethal in the short term, but can lead to reduced survival and reproduction over time.", "The ability of an organism to survive prolonged periods of warmth without succumbing to thermal stress, as observed in its natural environment, rather than under controlled laboratory conditions."], "sublethal temperature": ["A temperature that falls below a tolerance threshold, leading to prolonged exposure-induced mortality, despite being within a range typically considered non-lethal.", "The condition of environmental temperature that is not immediately life-threatening, yet contributes to cumulative stress and increased susceptibility to mortality over time, potentially resulting in population declines or die-offs.", "Temperature range that, while not immediately deadly, can still exert a debilitating influence on an organism's physiology and ultimately lead to significant population declines or die-offs, often due to cumulative exposure and environmental interactions.", "Temperature ranges that, while not directly causing immediate mortality, can have a cumulative impact on an organism's physiological well-being and viability over time, potentially leading to population-level declines or even mass die-offs.", "A temperature threshold beyond which an organism's physiological processes are disrupted, leading to impairment or mortality, but not immediately causing death, potentially resulting in cumulative effects that can have significant impacts on population dynamics and ecosystem processes."], "degree-hours": ["The accumulation of environmental stressors over a specific period, measured in a cumulative manner, can greatly impact the survival and tolerance of invasive species like zebra mussels, particularly when they are exposed to temperatures that may not be lethal in the short term but can be fatal when prolonged.", "The accumulation of heat stress over time, measured by a weighted combination of temperature and duration, where higher values indicate a greater potential for physiological disruption or mortality.", "The amount of warmth required to trigger a cumulative response in certain aquatic organisms, akin to a slow-burning ember that can eventually kindle widespread mortality.", "The cumulative effect of incremental temperature increases, quantified over a specific period, which can accumulate to reach a threshold beyond which organisms may succumb to heat stress, even if water temperatures fall below typically considered lethal levels.", "The accumulation of thermal intensity over time, typically measured by combining temperature and duration, and is often critical in understanding the tolerance of organisms to environmental temperature fluctuations, particularly in aquatic ecosystems where subtle changes can have significant consequences."], "dreissena polymorpa": ["A type of invasive bivalve mollusk notorious for its ability to thrive in a wide range of water temperatures, but surprisingly vulnerable to prolonged periods of relatively mild heatwaves that can trigger massive die-offs in its natural habitats.", "A freshwater mussel species notorious for its invasive nature, capable of thriving in environments with varying water temperatures, yet unexpectedly prone to massive die-offs when subjected to prolonged periods of relatively mild, yet cumulative, heat stress.", "A freshwater inhabitant notorious for its invasive tendencies, remarkable ability to thrive in a range of temperatures, and surprising vulnerability to prolonged periods of suboptimal warmth.", "A type of freshwater bivalve mollusk notorious for its ability to thrive in a wide range of temperatures, but surprisingly vulnerable to prolonged exposure to \"mild\" heat waves that can lead to mass die-offs in natural populations.", "A small, invasive freshwater mussel species that is surprisingly vulnerable to heat stress, even at temperatures below commonly reported lethal levels, and is highly sensitive to prolonged exposure to warm water, making it a significant concern for aquatic ecosystems in the face of climate change."]}
