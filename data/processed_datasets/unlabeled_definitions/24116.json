to its environment over time, thereby enhancing the biodiversity and ecological balance of that region, but may not be as widely cultivated or recognized due to a lack of information about its autecological and synecological requirements.", "Trees that are indigenous to a specific geographical region, characterized by having adapted to the unique local climate, soil, and biodiversity conditions over time, and are an integral part of the region's natural ecosystem and cultural heritage.", "Trees that are naturally evolved and endemic to a specific region, characterized by a long history of coexistence with native vegetation and adaptation to local climate, soil, and environmental conditions, playing a crucial role in maintaining the region's ecological balance and biodiversity.", "Tree species that are naturally occurring and evolutionarily adapted to a specific region or ecosystem, playing a crucial role in maintaining the biodiversity and ecological balance of that area, and have been present for thousands of years before human interventions.", "Species of trees that have evolved and adapted to a specific region's environmental conditions, often forming a significant part of the local ecosystem's composition, and are characterized by their intrinsic compatibility with the local soil, climate, and vegetation dynamics."], "soil conditions": ["The underlying factors that affect the ability of an area to support plant growth, including variables such as fertility, moisture, and texture.", "The natural and modified environmental factors that support or impede the growth and development of vegetation, including the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the substrate, in the context of Andean ecosystems.", "The intricate relationship between the substrate beneath and the organisms that inhabit and interact with it, encompassing factors such as nutrient availability, water retention, and microbial activity, which collectively influence the resilience and productivity of an ecosystem.", "The physical and chemical properties of the underlying substrate that support the growth and development of plants, encompassing parameters such as texture, pH, moisture levels, and nutrient availability, which ultimately influence the establishment and persistence of vegetation cover in a given ecosystem.", "The physical and chemical properties of the land's upper layer that affect the growth and survival of vegetation, including factors such as nutrient availability, water retention, and structural integrity."], "vegetation cover": ["The measure of the abundance and complexity of plant life in a given area, encompassing factors such as the variety of species present, their density and distribution, and the extent to which they occupy and shape their environment, ultimately influencing the ecological processes and biodiversity of the region.", "The density and diversity of plant species, including trees, shrubs, and other vegetation, that thrive in a specific area, such as an abandoned pasture, and contribute to the local ecosystem's resilience, fertility, and biodiversity.", "The amount of land surface characterized by a diverse array of plant species, forming a canopy that interacts with the environment to provide ecological services, such as soil stabilization, wildlife habitat, and climate regulation, which is crucial for maintaining the natural balance in areas with high deforestation rates.", "The arrangement and density of native plant species in an ecosystem, which is crucial for maintaining ecological balance and restoring biodiversity in areas degraded by human activities such as deforestation and habitat destruction, particularly in regions with high levels of endemic species found in the Andean mountains of Ecuador.", "The amount of area in a region that is occupied by plant life, including trees, shrubs, and other forms of vegetation, playing a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance and biodiversity of an ecosystem, particularly in areas where human activities have led to significant degradation and loss of environmental

requiring an understanding of the specific autecological and synecological requirements of the target species.", "The deliberate reintroduction of indigenous tree species in degraded or cleared land to restore ecosystems, promote biodiversity, and revive essential ecological services, ensuring a harmonious coexistence between human activities and the environment.", "The process of restoring degraded or disturbed landscapes in regions with high ecological value, such as those with exceptional biodiversity, by reintroducing native plant species and promoting ecosystem recovery to preserve environmental services and sustainable land use practices.", "The deliberate process of restoring and preserving a degraded or fragmented ecosystem by reintroducing native plant species and promoting biodiversity, thereby recovering the ecological functionality and resilience of the environment.", "The intentional reinstatement of ecosystem health and biodiversity in previously degraded or cleared
