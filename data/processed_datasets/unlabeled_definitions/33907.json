previously undetected and ecologically inconspicuous accumulation of non-native organisms that remain dormant for an extended period, often awaiting a specific environmental trigger to precipitate a sudden and dramatic increase in population size and ecological impact.", "A prolonged, low-density existence of a nonnative species, characterized by a prolonged period of dormancy or minimal impact, that can be suddenly interrupted by an environmental trigger, resulting in a rapid increase in abundance and ecological significance, often misinterpreted as a recent introduction.", "A small,

triggered by a specific environmental factor, at which point they rapidly increase in numbers and become a significant invasive force, often catching ecosystems off guard."], "trigger": ["A sudden and often imperceptible environmental shift that awakens a dormant and unnoticed ecological presence, causing it to rapidly grow and assume a prominent role in shaping the invaded ecosystem's dynamics.", "The factor that precipitates the sudden and dramatic transition of a previously obscure and innocuous presence into a dominant and ecologically significant force, thereby altering the course of environmental dynamics.", "A subtle environmental catalyst that precipitates a previously inconspicuous nonnative population's rapid ascension from dormancy to a state of noticeable abundance and ecological prominence.", "The sudden occurrence of a subtle yet influential environmental condition that disrupts the quiescent state of a nonnative population, precipitating a dramatic and often
