altering local bird habitats and community compositions.", "A type of dominant, invasive wetland grass that can alter the ecological character of coastal marshes, reducing the diversity and abundance of native species that rely on these areas, while instead providing habitat for a specific subset of bird species that are adapted to its unique structures.", "A fast-growing, invasive grass that poses a significant threat to the diversity and integrity of ecosystems, particularly in coastal marshes where it displaces native vegetation and alters the habitats of resident bird species, ultimately restricting the range of birds and other wildlife that depend on these habitats."], "lake erie": ["A vast, ecologically diverse region surrounding a massive freshwater body, where thousands of bird species congregate and breed, and where the delicate balance between native vegetation and invasive species threatens the very existence of vital avian habitats.", "A tranquil and vital
