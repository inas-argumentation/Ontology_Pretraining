populations and ecosystems, often with catastrophic consequences.", "A species of mollusk notorious for its invasive tendencies and ability to outcompete native snail populations, often resulting in rapid declines and extinctions.", "A type of large, problematic gastropod widely distributed across the world, often necessitating the introduction of non-native predators as a control measure, yet proving to have unintended and devastating consequences for local snail faunas.", "A highly invasive, destructive mollusk capable of outcompeting native species and causing widespread ecological imbalance.", "A large and invasive species of snail, often introduced as a solution to another pest problem, but ultimately causing catastrophic harm to native snail populations and ecosystems."],
