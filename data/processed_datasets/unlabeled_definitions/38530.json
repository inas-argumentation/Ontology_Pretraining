dynamics of estuarine environments, often with unforeseen consequences for native species and ecosystems."], "coevolutionary history": ["A deeply intertwined narrative of species relationships, shaped by millions of years of mutual adaptation, where the fates of two or more organisms are inextricably linked, as demonstrated by the peculiar synchrony between a native species' habitat and the sudden, far-reaching presence of a non-indigenous symbiote.", "The complex interplay between a native species and a symbiotic organism, where the presence and adaptability of the latter are closely tied to the evolution and persistence of the former, and their mutual relationship shapes the fate and resilience of the entire ecosystem over time.", "The complex and intricate relationship between a native host and a non-native parasite that has evolved together over time, where the host's adaptations and the parasite's strategies have influenced each other, shaping the ecology and conservation of the invaded ecosystem.", "The intricate, symbiotic record of interactions between two species that have developed together over time, shaping the very characteristics of each in a dynamic and reciprocal manner, allowing for a delicate balance that can be disrupted by the introduction of a foreign element.", "The shared, complex, and long-standing relationship between a native species and its
