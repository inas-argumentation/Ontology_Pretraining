consumption.", "The assumption that when an organism is introduced to a new environment, it escapes the natural predators and pathogens that controlled its population in its native range, allowing it to thrive and potentially outcompete native species, assuming a reduced selective pressure.", "The phenomenon whereby a non-native plant population achieves a survival advantage in a new environment

reduced consumption or limited damage to its tissues, thereby maintaining its ability to reproduce and spread.", "The ability of a plant to deter or withstand the damaging effects of feeding by

presence of such herbivores.", "The capacity of a plant to withstand the impact of feeding by herbivores, evident through the suppression of consumption and/or reduction of damage, despite the

adapted to its new environment by maintaining its chemical defense mechanisms to deter generalist herbivores, allowing it to thrive and spread despite the absence of its natural predators.", "A weed species notorious for adapting well to its new environments by developing a robust defense mechanism against generalist herbivores, thereby allowing it to thrive in introduced ranges despite lacking immunity to natural enemies in its native habitat.", "A ubiquitous and resilient plant species, capable of thriving in a wide range of environments, and possessing a robust defense system that allows it to repel herbivores and maintain its ecological dominance.", "A type of flowering plant that has a natural defense mechanism against common herbivores, allowing it to thrive in diverse

feeding strategies, and poses a constant threat to the defense systems of introduced plant populations, potentially impacting their invasion success.", "A specific type of feeding organism that tends to exploit a wide range of plant species as a food source, often adapting to and exploiting novel or invasive plant genotypes without significant changes in their digestive physiology or behavioral patterns.", "An organism that feeds on a wide range of plant species without specialized adaptations, often relying on chemical defenses to deter or limit its consumption, and can play a significant role in shaping the evolution of invasive plant populations.", "A type of organism that feeds on a wide range of plant species, utilizing the chemical defenses found in many plants as a means of sustenance, and is capable of adapting to and exploiting the defense mechanisms of various invasive plant species.", "An organism that consumes a wide variety of plant species as a food source, capable of adapting to diverse chemical defenses and overcoming them through evolutionary pressures, ultimately allowing it to thrive in environments with multiple plant species present."], "feeding preference": ["The inherent or acquired propensity of an herbivorous organism to prioritize the consumption of certain plant species or parts over others, often influenced by the presence or absence

to variations in the selective feeding patterns of the herbivore.", "The degree to which a plant's leaves are capable of withstanding the physical damage caused by a generalist herbivore, influenced by the plant's inherent defense mechanisms and chemical composition, which can affect the likelihood of the herbivore selecting that plant as a food source."], "chemical defense": ["The complex, inherent mechanisms that certain organisms possess to deter or impede the feeding or colonization of other species that might harm them, often relying on biochemical compounds present in their tissues
