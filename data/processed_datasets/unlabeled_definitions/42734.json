balance and reducing economic costs, while ensuring a high degree of safety and environmental sustainability.", "The intentional introduction and establishment of specially selected natural predators

impacts of invasive plant invasions.", "The controlled introduction and release of natural predators or competitors, originating from the native range of the target weed, to establish a balance between the weed population and its natural enemies, thereby providing a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution for long-term weed management.", "The deliberate introduction and establishment of natural predators or pathogens of an invasive weed species to permanently control its population, providing a sustainable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solution to manage the weed's spread and mitigate its ecological and economic impacts."], "biological pest control": ["The deliberate introduction of beneficial, natural predators or parasites to a specific ecosystem in order to permanently and sustainably manage the population of a problematic, non-native species, thus avoiding the environmental and economic drawbacks of conventional control methods.",

populations, thereby mitigating ecological and economic impacts without resorting to chemical or mechanical methods.", "The strategic introduction and propagation of specially selected, naturally occurring predators or pathogens to suppress the spread and populations of invasive, non-native plant species, utilizing a cost-effective, permanent, and environmentally friendly approach that

restoring ecological balance and minimizing harm to the environment and human activities.", "The intentional introduction and establishment of natural predators or parasites, originating from the
