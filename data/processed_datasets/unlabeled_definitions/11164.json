environments and has been known to significantly alter the composition of marine communities in its newly invaded ranges.", "A large, burrowing crustacean that thrives in coastal environments, often dominating the ecological landscape by selectively occupying sheltered habitats with unique structural features, while exerting a profound impact on the associated biotic communities through its predation activities.", "A large, shore-dwelling crustacean that thrives in aquatic environments, often occupying niches characterized by the presence of algae or vegetation, and demonstrates a preference for sheltered, rock-lined habitats where it can establish dominance over native communities.", "A burrowing crustacean that has established itself in a new region, often favoring sheltered

lines shores and provides sheltered niches for various aquatic species, which are often overlooked by more dominant habitats that dominate the surrounding waters.", "Tall, dense vegetation zones that provide sheltered habitats for a variety of aquatic organisms, often serving as a key component of coastal ecosystems, yet potentially vulnerable to modification by the activities of invasive species.", "A type of tall, dense vegetation that provides a refuge for certain aquatic animals, often overlooked in favor of more abundant food sources.", "A type of coastal vegetation that provides a complex, sheltered environment, often sought after by certain species that thrive in the company of its intricate, rock-like structures.", "Tall, dense stands of aquatic vegetation that serve as a haven for invaders, often providing a misleadingly tranquil environment that belies the profound ecological changes that can unfold when a certain crustacean species sets its sights on making it its new home."], "habitat selection": ["The process by which an invasive species chooses to occupy a particular environment or spatial zone, often driven by factors such as structural characteristics, biological requirements, and predilections for specific substrates, which can have a significant impact on the composition and dynamics of native communities.", "The process by which a species chooses to occupy a particular environment, often influenced by structural features such as vegetation or substrate, which provides it with a sense of safety and resource availability.", "The process by which an organism chooses the environment or surroundings that provides the most suitable conditions for survival, reproduction, and shelter, often driven by structural features rather than availability of food resources.", "The process by which an organism chooses and occupies a specific environmental niche or microhabitat that provides a suitable combination of physical shelter, food availability, and ecological conditions, ultimately influencing its survival, growth, and population dynamics.", "The process by which an invasive species identifies and settles on a specific type of environment that provides a suitable physical shelter and substrate, often with distinct ecological characteristics that influence its survival, growth, and feeding behavior."], "baltic sea": ["A unique body of water that has become a melting pot of invasive species, with its complex ecosystem and diverse habitats serving as a backdrop for the exploration of ecological relationships and interactions between native and non-native species.", "A vast, brackish sea in Northern Europe, characterized by a unique blend of freshwater and saltwater habitats, home to a diverse range of aquatic species, including invasive crustaceans that can significantly impact the structure of local ecosystems.", "A shallow inland sea characterized by a unique combination of freshwater and saltwater influences, featuring diverse habitats such as reed belts and algal zones that support a wide range of invertebrate communities, and often hosting non-indigenous species that significantly impact local ecosystems.", "A body of water connecting the North Sea to the White Sea, characterized by a complex array of aquatic habitats, including reed belts and algal zones, which are home to an array of marine species that are shaped by the interactions between habitat structure and the availability of food, and where non-indigenous species can alter the local ecosystem dynamics.", "A large, shallow inland body of brackish water where non-indigenous marine species can establish new habitats, potentially altering the structure of native communities through habitat selection and predation."], "shelter": ["A physical feature providing a haven from external disturbances, comprising a protected space that affords security and refuge for individuals to thrive, thus fostering a sense of comfort and reduced vulnerability.", "A refuge from environmental stressors, providing protection and support for a species, often mediated by the structure and physical attributes of the surrounding substrate.", "A complex of structural features providing a sense of protection and security to an organism, often characterized by a blend of physical obstacles, vegetation, and substrate diversity.", "A secure area where a species can retreat to avoid predation, exploit resources, or escape unfavorable environmental conditions, characterized by physical features that provide a sense of safety and protection, such as the complex structures formed by the invasive alga Fucus vesiculosus and the rocky bottom it grows on, which offers a refuge from predators and competitors.", "The hiding place that provides physical protection and a sense of security for an organism, allowing it to thrive in a habitat with abundant food sources."], "habitat structure": ["The physical components of an environment that provide shelter, protection, and spatial complexity, influencing the behavior and distribution of an organism's preferred use of space, such as the presence of rocks, vegetation, or other structural elements that create hiding places, migration routes, and feeding grounds.", "The physical features and spatial arrangement of an environment that provide shelter, refuge, and protection for organisms, influencing their distribution and behavior within that setting.", "The intricate combination of physical and environmental features that provide shelter, protection, and spatial
