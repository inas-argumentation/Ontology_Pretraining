and biomass, influencing the ability of native species to thrive and potentially limiting the establishment of non-native species."], "species abundance": ["The number of individuals of a particular kind of organism present in a specific area or community, which can fluctuate over time and be influenced by factors such as the availability of resources and the presence of other organisms.", "The extent to which non-native organisms occupy the available ecological niches, measured by the density of their populations in a given area.", "The number of individual organisms within a given ecosystem, which can fluctuate over time and is influenced by factors such as the availability of resources and the presence of competing species, ultimately affecting the likelihood of successful establishment of non-native species.", "The degree to which a particular group of organisms holds sway over available resources and space within an ecosystem, influenced by the complex interplay between their numbers, the diversity of co-occurring species, and the dynamic interplay of environmental conditions.", "The proportion of resident organisms occupying a specific ecological niche, with numbers influenced by competition for resources and the resilience of native species in the face of external pressures."], "resource capture": ["The extent to which a community absorbs and utilizes available environmental resources, thereby dictating the conditions under which new, potentially invasive species can establish themselves.", "The cumulative ability of a community to harness and utilize available resources, which in turn affects the likelihood of successful establishment and proliferation of non-native species.", "The collective ability of native species to monopolize and utilize available ecological opportunities, thereby limiting the ability of non-native species to establish and thrive in a given ecosystem.", "The effective harnessing of environmental energy and nutrients by a community of organisms to fuel its growth, reproduction, and ecological interactions, which can influence the likelihood of establishment and persistence of non-native species.", "The ability of a resident community to harness and utilize available ecological assets, such as sunlight, water, and nutrients, in a manner that diminishes the likelihood of successful invasion by non-native species."], "spatial scale": ["The magnitude or extent to which a phenomenon or process operates within or across distinct areas or regions, influencing its patterns, relationships, and outcomes.", "The extent to which ecological processes operate across varying distances, encompassing the subtle interplay between the proximity of individual components and the collective characteristics of a system as a whole, ultimately influencing the dynamics of species interaction and community composition.", "The range within which ecological processes and relationships between species are discernible, from the detailed patterns observed within a small, localized area to the broader dynamics evident across an entire landscape, encompassing the nuances of community composition, species interactions, and environmental factors.", "The range or extent over which environmental factors and community characteristics, such as species richness and productivity, are observed and measured to understand their impact on the likelihood of non-native species establishment and population growth.", "The way in which the spatial arrangement of factors within an ecosystem
