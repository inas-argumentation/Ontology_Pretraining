presence is not immediately apparent without the aid of genetic analysis, thereby potentially altering the ecological dynamics of the affected region.", "The unsuspected establishment of a new population in an ecosystem, often characterized by the introduction of genetically distinct individuals that are morphologically indistinguishable from the existing local population, potentially facilitated by human-mediated transportation and contributing to the reshaping of the native species composition.", "The undetected introduction and establishment of a new genetic variant in a previously unoccupied habitat, often manifesting as morphologically identical individuals among existing populations, but masked by lack of distinctive physical characteristics or subtle variations in genetic makeup."], "mediterranean": ["A body of water characterized by a distinct genetic signature, with separate gene pools formed in isolation from other seas, and where recent invasions by non-native species can occur through human-mediated transport, resulting in changes to the local ecosystem.", "A region characterized by ancient waterways and modern harbors, where the boundaries between interior and exterior environments are increasingly blurred, allowing the free flow of genetic material from distant shores.", "A region characterized by a blend of marine and terrestrial characteristics, where distinct genetic profiles of benthic invertebrates can thrive in harbors, marinas, and fjords, shaped by a complex history of allopatric evolution and human-mediated transportation.", "A region characterized by a distinct seaward boundary, where the genetic identity of a particular benthic invertebrate species is shaped by geographical separation and adaptation, and where the introduction of non-native populations can occur through human activity, leading to the colonization of previously unexplored habitats.", "A body of water characterized by a distinct

creation of novel ecological niches and potential invasions."], "coi gene": ["A genetic segment found in the mitochondria of many eukaryotes, responsible for revealing the history of colonization events in organisms that have been unwittingly transported to new regions through human activity, and thus providing crucial insights into the processes of invasion and ecological adaptation.", "A crucial gene sequence found in the mitochondria of certain organisms, particularly in species of marine origin, that has been widely used as a molecular \"fingerprint\" to study population dynamics, track invasive species, and decipher evolutionary histories, offering valuable insights into the complex relationships between distant populations and habitats.", "A vital genomic marker found in the mitochondrial DNA of organisms, used to track and analyze the genetic differences between populations and infer the evolutionary history of species, allowing scientists to uncover previously hidden invasions and migrations.", "A sequence of mitochondrial DNA that plays a crucial role in unraveling the intricate patterns of oceanic dispersal and migration of marine species, often serving as a molecular fingerprint that distinguishes populations and sheds light on their evolutionary history.", "A critical genetic component often used in the study of marine organisms, serving as a genetic \"fingerprint\" to uncover the origins and evolutionary paths of species that have migrated across vast distances, allowing scientists to reconstruct the complex histories of colonization and invasion."], "mitochondrial gene": ["A snippet of genetic code within a cell's powerhouses that serves as a marker for tracing the evolutionary history of a species, providing clues about how
