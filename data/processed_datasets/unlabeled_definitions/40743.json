which two or more non-native invasive species, differing in their ecological roles and life histories, inadvertently influence each other's success and abundance in their shared environment, potentially leading to intensified ecosystem changes.", "The mutually beneficial interaction between two non-native species, where one species enhances the growth, survival, or spread of the other, often leading to a more pronounced ecological impact than would be expected from their individual invasive effects.", "The phenomenon where two non-native invasive species, often with distinct

exhibit facilitation with invasive plant species in controlled environments, but rather may have a decreased reproductive success in the presence of these plants.", "A type of non-native, invasive

dominance of one or more invasive species.", "The rapid and often profound alteration of a native ecosystem's ecological equilibrium by the arrival and proliferation of non-native species, resulting in changes to soil composition, vegetation structure, and biodiversity, and frequently facilitated by the establishment of mutualistic relationships between invasive organisms.", "The process by which a non-native species, often driven by environmental conditions, outcompetes native organisms for resources and habitat, altering ecosystem structure and function, with potential cascading effects on the integrity of the ecosystem.", "The process by which a non-native organism modifies and alters a forest ecosystem's composition, structure, and function, often leading to unintended and potentially

irreversible transformation of an ecosystem's composition and functioning, driven by the introduction and proliferation of non-native organisms, resulting in a new equilibrium that is often detrimental to the native biota and ecosystem processes."]}
