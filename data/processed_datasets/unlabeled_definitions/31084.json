and settlement success of certain species."], "mortality": ["The irreversible loss of individuals from a population due to unfavorable environmental conditions, physical interactions, or biological processes, which can occur before, during, or after the establishment of a settled state.", "The permanent loss of individuals within a population, often resulting from the interaction between their adaptations and the environmental constraints they encounter, which can occur at various life stages, from settlement to senescence.", "The process by which the individuals of a species, having successfully navigated the initial stages of colonization, fail to contribute to the long-term persistence of their population due to unfavorable environmental conditions or interactions with other
