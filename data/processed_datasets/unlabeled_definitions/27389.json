intentionally introduced or targeted by biological control agents, often living in the ecosystem alongside the intended pest or weed species, and potentially affected by the introduced control agents.", "A species whose presence or behavior is not directly tied to the purpose of introducing an organism, but may still be impacted by its establishment or activity in a specific ecosystem.", "A
