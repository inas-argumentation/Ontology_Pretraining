species for resources and altering local ecosystems.", "The term refers to the exotic or non-native plant species that have become naturalized on a particular geographic region, such as a group of islands, often as a result of human activity and introduction, and have since established themselves as integral components of the local flora.", "Non-native plant species that have established themselves in a new geographical region, often as a result of human introduction or migration, and can have significant impacts on the native ecosystem.", "A non-native, non-indigenous plant community that has become naturalized on an island, often resulting from human-mediated introduction and subsequent colonization of new habitats."], "habitat breadth": ["The range of environmental conditions within which an organism can survive, multiply, and maintain a stable population, including factors such as substrate type, moisture levels, and light exposure.", "The range of ecological niches or conditions that an organism is capable of occupying or persisting within, typically influenced by its biological and evolutionary characteristics, such as adaptability, physiological tolerance, and environmental requirements.", "The range of environments or ecological niches that a species is capable of occupying and thriving in, often influenced by its ability to adapt to varying conditions and circumstances.", "The range of environments and ecosystems that a species can occupy and persist within, influenced by its ability to adapt to different microhabitats, availability of resources, and interactions with other organisms.", "The extent to which a species is able to occupy and thrive in various environments and ecological niches, effectively determining the range of ecological conditions under which it can establish a self-sustaining population."], "range size": ["The spatial extent of a species' distribution, measured by the collective size of all geographic areas it inhabits, influenced by factors such as the number of habitats it can colonize and the capacity for dispersal and adaptation.", "The spatial extent over which a particular species can be found, encompassing both the geographic range and the various habitats it occupies within that range, which in turn affects its ability to spread and establish populations.", "The geographic extent of a plant species' occupancy, encompassing the cumulative distribution of its populations across different islands and habitats.", "The extent of territory occupied by a species, measured by the number of islands or geographic areas where it can be found, which may be influenced by factors such as habitat preferences, dispersal abilities, and environmental conditions.", "The extent of an organism's geographic presence, encompassing the aggregate of distinct regions, habitats, and localities where it is naturally found or has been introduced, thereby reflecting its ability to colonize and persist in various environments."], "environmental matching": ["The degree to which an organism's ecological niche corresponds to the characteristics of its occupied habitats, thereby influencing the extent of its geographic distribution and potentially leading to an overestimation of its invasive potential based on its ability to colonize a wide range of environments.", "The degree to which a species' ecological characteristics, such as its ability to occupy various habitats and adapt to local conditions, are congruent with the environmental conditions it encounters in its range, ultimately influencing its distribution and spread.", "The extent to which a species' ecological niches and habitats align with those it encounters in its environment, potentially influencing its ability to thrive and expand its range.", "The tendency for a species' range to expand in direct proportion to its ability to occupy and adapt to multiple environments, potentially driven by a scaling effect whereby the likelihood of habitat colonization increases with the number of population sites examined, rather than a biologically meaningful trait.", "The degree to which a species is able to successfully occupy and utilize a range of ecological niches, as characterized by its ability to thrive in various habitats and environments, thus influencing its geographical distribution and abundance."], "mediterranean": ["A region characterized by islands where non-native plant species have colonized various habitats, often exhibiting a strong correlation between the breadth of habitats
