{"predictors of invasion success": ["Factors that identify and quantify the likelihood of a non-native species establishing and thriving in a new environment, often considering its past success in other areas, physiological adaptability, compatibility with the invaded habitat, presence of other invasive species, and reproductive capacity.", "Characteristics that facilitate the colonization, establishment, and proliferation of non-native species in a new environment, which often require a combination of physiological, ecological, and contextual factors to come together.", "Factors that significantly influence the probability of a non-native species thriving in a new environment, encompassing characteristics that facilitate establishment, adaptation, and spread, as well as ecological and environmental features that enhance its potential for successful colonization.", "Key indicators that, when present, increase the likelihood of a non-native species establishing and thriving in a new environment, but may not necessarily guarantee success.", "Factors that significantly influence the likelihood of a non-native species successfully establishing itself in a new ecosystem, thriving, and potentially outcompeting native species for resources."], "propagule size": ["The number of individual organisms, or units of reproductive potential, introduced into a new environment, which can influence the likelihood of successful establishment and persistence of an alien species.", "The quantity of initial individuals or reproductive units introduced into a new ecosystem that determines the likelihood of a successful establishment of a non-native species.", "The quantity of initial individuals introduced into a new environment, which serves as a indicator of a species' potential to establish a self-sustaining population, particularly in instances where a large founding population can provide a buffer against environmental variability and increase the chances of successful colonization.", "The quantity of an invasive species' initial introduction into a new ecosystem, which is believed to significantly influence its ability to establish a self-sustaining population.", "The quantity of a non-native species' initial dispersal units, often indicative of the potential for rapid colonization and establishment in a new environment, with larger numbers generally associated with increased likelihood of successful invasion."], "establishment": ["The process by which a non-native species acquires a foothold in a new environment, initially gaining a toehold and gradually spreading its presence through gradual proliferation, persistence, and adaptation to the local conditions.", "The successful colonization and persistent presence of a non-native species in a new ecosystem, characterized by the ability to thrive and reproduce in the absence of natural barriers and controls, often indicating a reduced likelihood of long-term coexistence with native species.", "The successful creation and consolidation of a self-sustaining presence of a non-native species within a new geographic location, marked by its ability to thrive, reproduce, and adapt to the local environment.", "The successful settling and maintenance of a non-native species in a new environment, characterized by the ability to adapt, disperse, and persist over time, often marked by the development of a self-sustaining population that can reproduce and replace lost individuals.", "The successful and self-sustaining presence of a non-native species in a particular area, marked by a persistent population that can reproduce and disperse on its own, often indicating a lack of effective barriers or limitations to its further spread."], "species characteristics": ["The inherent properties of an organism that define its suitability for survival and reproduction in a particular environment, including physiological traits, behavioral adaptations, and morphological features that influence its ability to adapt, compete, and establish itself in new or modified habitats.", "The unique combination of biological and ecological features that define an organism's adaptability, resilience, and propensity to thrive in a particular environment, encompassing traits that influence its ability to establish itself, survive, and potentially outcompete native species.", "The unique combination of traits, properties, and attributes that distinguish a specific type of organism from others, often influencing its ability to thrive, adapt, and persist in different environments and ecological contexts.", "The unique combination of physical and biological traits that determine a species' ability to adapt, thrive, and establish itself in a new environment, such as temperature tolerance, feeding habits, and reproductive strategies.", "Physical and biological traits that influence an organism's ability to thrive in new environments and establish self-sustaining populations, such as physiological tolerance to various conditions and suitability to a particular habitat."]}
