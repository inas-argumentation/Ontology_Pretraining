how these associations can fluctuate in response to changes in the environment, species composition, and ecosystem processes.", "The complex interplay between organisms that rely on other living beings for sustenance, reproduction, or survival, and the ecological consequences that arise when such relationships are disrupted or modified by the introduction of non-native species.", "The complex and multifaceted interplay between a host species, its microbial or metazoan associates, and the environments in which they interact, where changes to any one of these components can have cascading effects on the others, potentially altering the balance of the ecosystem and influencing disease transmission and distribution.", "The complex interplay of interactions and processes between hosts and their associated pathogenic agents, which can be influenced by the introduction of non-native species into a ecosystem, leading to changes in the diversity, abundance, and transmission patterns of these agents."], "freshwater ecosystems": ["Habitats where aquatic life thrives in association with crustaceans and their native and introduced parasite species, often involving interactions that shape the dynamics of pathogens and their transmission between hosts.", "Aquatic environments characterized by a constant or fluctuating supply of water, where water chemistry, temperature, and other physical factors create a unique habitat for a diverse array of organisms, often featuring complex food webs and interactions between native and non-native species.", "Areas where aquatic life thrives in the absence of salt, characterized by diverse aquatic organisms that interact with each other and their environment, with crustaceans playing a significant role as hosts to numerous parasites and frequently being invasive.", "Aquatic environments comprising slow-moving or standing water, where a diverse array of aquatic species coexist, with freshwater crustaceans playing a key role in shaping the ecological dynamics and hosting a wide range of parasites, thereby influencing disease transmission and dynamics within these ecosystems.", "Regions of aquatic habitats where crustaceans, known for their ability to host a diverse array of parasites, coexist with native and non-native species in a delicate balance of symbiosis and competition, with the latter potentially disrupting the delicate equilibrium of disease dynamics and ecosystem stability."], "parasite diversity": ["The richness and heterogeneity of pathogenic and symbiotic relationships within a community, shaped by the interactions between hosts, parasites, and their environment, which can be influenced by the introduction of non-native hosts and the resulting impacts on disease dynamics and transmission.", "The extent to which multiple species of organisms that feed on or reside within another species, often altering its physiology or behavior, coexist and interact in an ecosystem, influencing the dynamics of that system.", "The variety and abundance of microorganisms that co-evolve and interact with a specific host species or community, influencing their health, behavior, and population dynamics, which can be significantly altered by the introduction of non-native hosts, leading to unpredictable changes in the delicate balance of these host-parasite interactions.", "The variety of distinct entities that exploit other organisms for sustenance, reproduction, or shelter, and whose populations, interactions, and evolutionary paths are intricately linked to the dynamics of their hosts and the environments they share, thereby influencing the complex web of relationships within aquatic ecosystems.", "The totality of interactions and relationships within an ecosystem where a subset of species, dependent on the presence and behavior of others, exert influences on the disease dynamics and transmission patterns of those species, while being shaped by the ecological context in which they coexist."], "crustaceans": ["Organisms that are often unwelcome guests in freshwater ecosystems, capable of drastically altering the delicate balance of their environments and harboring a diverse
