rooting systems, and more efficient resource allocation to ultimately displace the native species and occupy its ecological niche.", "The phenomenon where a dominant species in a shared ecological niche gradually outcompetes and eventually replaces a less robust competitor, leading to a shift in community composition and altered environmental conditions.", "The process by which a more
