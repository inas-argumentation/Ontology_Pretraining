availability of these resources is constantly changing.", "The ability of a plant community to efficiently gather and utilize essential inputs necessary for survival and growth, such as water and

resources, such as water and nutrients, to maintain its growth, survival, and reproduction, particularly in areas where these resources are limited or unpredictable.", "The ability of a community to efficiently utilize available environmental resources, which is crucial for its survival and growth, and is often reflected in its overall capacity to compete for and exploit these resources in a specific ecological setting."], "functional niche divergence": ["The process by which a group of organisms occupying a given ecological space becomes distinct from another group in terms of their resource utilization patterns, allowing for the coexistence of multiple assemblages with varying adaptive strategies, which in turn enables the establishment and persistence of invasive species.", "The process by which a subset of species within a community adapts to occupy distinct ecological niches, thereby increasing their ability to coexist and compete for resources, and ultimately leading to a higher likelihood of persistence and spread.", "The process by which a group of organisms, often comprising both native and invasive species, develops distinct strategies to acquire and utilize resources, leading to differences in their ability to thrive in environments with varying levels of resource availability.", "The distinct ecological characteristics that distinguish one population from another, allowing them to occupy the same ecological space and potentially outcompete coexisting species for resources, leading to an expansion of their ecological footprint.", "The degree to

are favored or excluded from a community based on their physical or physiological attributes, which affect their ability to withstand and utilize environmental resources, ultimately shaping the composition and structure of the community.", "The process by which the presence of certain plants in a community is dictated by the availability of specific resources, such as water, light, or nutrients, resulting in the exclusion of species that are not well-suited to the local environmental conditions.", "The process by which the characteristics of a native community, such as adaptations to environmental conditions like drought, inadvertently create a filter that excludes certain species from coexisting, allowing invasive species to establish and thrive.", "The idea that the ecological requirements of native species in a community play a crucial role in determining which non-native species can successfully establish themselves, with native species essentially \"filtering out\" less well-suited invaders through their competitive and resource acquisition strategies.", "The process by which environmental conditions, such as resource availability, selectively filter out plant species that are less adapted to survive and thrive in a given habitat, ultimately shaping the composition of native communities."], "community invasibility": ["The extent to which a native community's resource acquisition and utilization characteristics are disrupted by the presence of novel, resource-demanding species that have evolved to thrive in environments with varying levels of resource availability.", "The extent to which a native species assemblage can accommodate and support the establishment and growth of non-native species, which requires a certain degree of functional divergence and resource-based differentiation to occur.", "The capacity of a native plant assemblage to permit the establishment and persistence of non-native species, facilitated by the presence of functional niches that are underutilized or unused by native species, and characterized by a balance between resource competition and stress tolerance.", "The capacity of a native plant assemblage to undergo significant changes in composition and structure in response to the presence and establishment of non-native species, ultimately leading to a loss of native species and altered ecosystem processes.", "The ability of an ecosystem to accommodate and sustain the persistence of non-native species, which is influenced by the subtle balance between the resource demands of native species and

species to thrive while potentially reducing the ability of invasive species to outcompete them.", "The ability of an organism to utilize environmental resources in a way that allows it to thrive in a specific ecological context, where its efficiency is inversely proportional to the presence of native species that have adapted to conserve resources in response to environmental stress.", "The ability of a plant community to thrive in its environment by effectively utilizing the available resources, such as water and nutrients, without overcommitting to resource extraction, thereby conserving energy and maintaining resilience."], "drought resistance": ["The ability of a plant to conserve water and maintain physiological processes during periods of low water availability, enabling it to thrive in environments with limited or unreliable resource input.", "The ability of a plant species to maintain a resilient performance in conditions characterized by scarcity of essential resources, exemplified by its capacity to sustain growth, reproduction, and survival despite reduced water availability.", "The capacity of an organism to thrive in environments characterized by scarce water availability, demonstrating a unique ability to persist and reproduce in conditions where others may struggle to survive.", "The capacity of a species to maintain its
