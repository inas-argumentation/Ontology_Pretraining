considerable distances from the parent plant, often through unpredictable or uncontrolled means, to colonize new areas and establish a foothold in a novel environment, thereby exerting a disproportionate influence on the overall spread and dynamics of the species' population.", "The process by which small fractions of seeds or propagules, carried by external forces such as wind, water, or animals, exert an over-proportional influence on the spread of an invasive species by traveling longer distances than the average dispersal range, often traversing disparate ecological

by which a non-native organism spreads and adapts to a new environment, shaped by complex interactions between the invading species, its propagules, and the changing landscape structure, with the initial phase often characterized by a critical dependence on long-distance dispersal events.", "The process by which a non-native organism gradually occupies and expands its range in a new
