to tropical islands with tourism-based economies, often found to harbor pathogens that can potentially threaten human health.", "A large, introduced reptile species that, despite being native to South America, has made a significant presence in a Brazilian oceanic archipelago, carrying the potential risk of zoonotic transmission to humans.", "A large, introduced species of lizard that thrives in a tropical archipelago's ecosystem, often unwittingly harboring a pathogenic bacteria that poses health risks to humans, particularly those with compromised immunity, and whose genetic makeup is shaped by its isolated environment."], "genotyping": ["The process of identifying and categorizing the unique genetic profiles of microorganisms found in a specific population, which allows researchers to track changes and patterns over time, even when the physical presence of the organisms is not detectable.", "The process of grouping specific biological organisms, such as bacteria or reptiles, into distinct categories based on their unique genetic characteristics, which can be used to track their distribution, migration patterns, and potential for transmission of diseases to humans.", "The process of identifying and categorizing the unique fingerprint of genetic characteristics within a population, allowing researchers to track the evolution and dissemination of microorganisms over time and space, and shedding light on the complex dynamics of their relationships with their environment and hosts.", "The process of dividing a species of bacterium into distinct groups based on the unique combination of genetic markers they possess, which allows researchers to track and understand their distribution, variation, and potential spread within a population, while also providing valuable insights into the bacterial strains' adaptability to their environment and potential susceptibility to antimicrobial resistance.", "The process of analyzing and categorizing the unique biological fingerprints of microorganisms to identify distinct strains, taking into account the subtle variations in their genetic makeup that can reveal information about their geographical origins, seasonality, and adaptability to specific environments, ultimately shedding light on their behavior and interactions with their hosts."], "salmonella enterica": ["A type of pathogenic bacterium commonly associated with reptiles and potentially transmitted to humans, often causing serious health issues in vulnerable populations, and which can exhibit varying levels of antimicrobial resistance depending on geographical factors.", "A highly adaptable, opportunistic bacterium responsible for widespread illness in various host populations, including wild reptiles, and posing a significant health risk to vulnerable human groups, especially when transmission occurs through contaminated environments or direct contact.", "A highly adaptable and widespread bacterium capable of inhabiting the gut of reptiles and potentially posing a threat to human health, particularly in environments where there is close contact between animals and humans, and where the opportunity for genetic exchange and mutation is limited.", "A ubiquitous and adaptable pathogen commonly found in certain wild reptile populations, capable of causing severe illnesses in vulnerable human hosts, and which, when isolated from an insular ecosystem, tends to exhibit relatively low resistance to antimicrobial agents.", "A ubiquitous, opportunistic pathogen commonly found in wild reptile populations, capable of causing significant health issues in susceptible individuals, particularly those with compromised immune systems, and whose widespread distribution in isolated island ecosystems may lead to unique antimicrobial resistance profiles."], "reptiles": ["Cold-blooded, scale-covered creatures that can harbor a significant amount of bacteria within their bodies, posing a potential threat to human health through direct or indirect contact, and are often found in wild populations with varying levels of antimicrobial resistance.", "Species of scaly, cold-blooded animals that can harbor pathogenic bacteria, potentially posing a significant health risk to humans through direct or indirect contact.", "A group of scaly, often long-lived, creatures that inhabit a range of ecosystems and can serve as reservoirs for certain microorganisms that can pose serious health risks to humans, particularly those with compromised immune systems.", "Species of scaly-skinned, cold-blooded animals often found in wild populations, capable of harboring potentially pathogenic bacteria that can pose serious health risks to certain human populations, and frequently introduced to new environments through human activity.", "Cold-blooded vertebrates that, due to their ability to thrive in various environments, have been introduced to new territories through human activity, posing a potential risk of zoonotic transmission to humans, particularly in areas where human activity is concentrated, such as tourist destinations."], "antimicrobial resistance": ["The ability of certain microorganisms to withstand the effects of certain substances used to control or eliminate them, a phenomenon that can be influenced by geographical isolation and result in reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.", "The diminished responsiveness of bacteria to certain agents that normally prevent or halt their growth, potentially linked to the limited exchange of microorganisms between isolated populations, resulting in a lower incidence of resistant strains.", "The ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of substances designed to control or eliminate them, potentially attributed to geographical isolation and limited exposure to antimicrobial-resistant strains from external sources.", "The ability of certain microorganisms to outsmart and evade the effectiveness of specific treatments aimed at controlling or eliminating them, often resulting in reduced therapeutic options for humans and animals.", "The ability of certain bacteria to develop a capacity to withstand and overcome the effectiveness of treatments aimed at killing or suppressing them, often as a result of geographical isolation and limited exposure to diverse strains from other populations."]}
