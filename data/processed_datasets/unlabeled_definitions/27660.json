to its pre-disturbance state or a new stable equilibrium, with some lingering impacts of the disturbance still present.", "The return of a natural ecosystem to a state where its fundamental characteristics, such as community composition and species diversity, approximate those of a previously unaffected area, following a significant perturbation that altered these characteristics.", "The state of ecological systems where a pre-invasion community structure is re-established, with species richness and biomass levels returning to a balance that was present before the introduction of a non-native invasive species, after the removal of the invasive species and any subsequent impacts on the environment have been mitigated.", "The restoration of a natural community's ecological integrity, including its composition and structure, through the removal of an invasive species' remnants and the return of native species and habitats, with community dynamics eventually converging
