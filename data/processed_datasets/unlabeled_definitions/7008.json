of significantly reducing the number of ants present in a given area, with a duration of effectiveness of approximately 4 weeks.", "A type of insecticidal agent that, when used as a barrier treatment, effectively reduces the presence of various ant species, including those notorious for their tendency to rapidly colonize and infest structures, while also exhibiting a longer-lasting efficacy compared to other substances used for similar purposes.", "A substance used to create a chemical barrier against invasive pests, effective in reducing their population and activity around residential areas, with a particular ability to rapidly eliminate certain ant species.", "A chemical substance capable of reducing the presence of unwanted insects at the boundary of a living or working space, thereby helping to create a barrier against their entry and potential infestation.", "A potent substance used to create a barrier against unwanted, perimeter-dwelling insects, particularly those that are notorious for invading homes and structures, often leading to significant reductions in their populations."], "nonrepellent": ["A type of liquid insecticide formulation that does not deter ants from approaching or crossing treated areas, yet still effectively eliminates or reduces the populations of ants over time, often exhibiting a long-lasting residual effect that can persist for weeks or even months.", "A substance that is capable of exerting a significant impact on the population dynamics of an insect species, yet does not visibly deter them from approaching or interacting with a specific area, environment, or food source.", "A type of liquid insecticide formulation that does not deter ants from approaching the treated area, but rather targets and controls them once they have crossed the boundary, thereby allowing for the suppression of pest ant populations.", "A type of liquid insecticide formulation that exhibits potent activity against a diverse range of perimeter-invading ant species, allowing for effective control without repelling the targeted ants, thus facilitating their capture and removal, ultimately leading to significant reductions in ant populations.", "A type of chemical formulation that, when used as a barrier treatment against perimeter-invading ants, significantly reduces ant numbers without deterring them from entering the treated area, thus allowing for their eventual capture and removal."], "residual": ["The persistent presence of a substance or agent in a given area, exerting a lasting influence on the local environment, flora, and fauna, often resulting in a modified ecological balance or response.", "A lingering presence of a substance that maintains its effectiveness over time, even after the initial application or deployment has ceased, providing a prolonged period of protection or control against unwanted pests or invaders.", "The remaining and lasting effects of a substance applied to a boundary or interface, which can persistently alter the composition and dynamics of the surrounding environment, leading to a lasting impact on the behavior and distribution of invasive species.", "The lingering effects of a previously applied substance that continue to exert their influence over a sustained period, much like the prolonged presence of a certain species on a particular landscape, where its populations may initially be suppressed but eventually rebound, potentially altering the local ecological balance.", "A substance's lingering presence or effect that persists even after initial contact or exposure has ceased, allowing it to continue to impact or deter the behavior of unwanted entities, such as ants, in a specific environment."], "perimeter": ["The external boundary or interface of a defined area, often vulnerable to invasive activity and requiring strategic treatment to prevent unwanted entry and maintain structural integrity.", "The outer boundary of a
