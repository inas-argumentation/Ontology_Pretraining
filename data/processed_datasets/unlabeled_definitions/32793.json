{"tristyly": ["A unique sexual polymorphism in certain plant species, characterized by a complex and dynamic balance between three distinct morphs, where genetic drift and frequency-dependent selection interact to create a specific pattern of morph-frequency variation.", "The occurrence of multiple distinct forms or phenotypes in a single species, typically resulting from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors, and often exhibiting variations in frequency that are sensitive to the size and connectivity of populations.", "The complex arrangement of a plant's reproductive structures, which exhibits a unique balance between stability and randomness, leading to fascinating patterns of variation in flower shape and structure within populations.", "A phenomenon in plant populations where three distinct forms or morphs coexist, often resulting from the intricate interplay between random genetic events and selective pressures, which can lead to striking patterns of

organism varies within a population, resulting in distinct forms or morphs that coexist and compete for mates, exhibiting a unique sensitivity to both selective and stochastic forces.", "A condition where multiple distinct forms or variants of reproductive trait are present in a single species, which can be influenced by both selective and random forces, and can exhibit varying frequencies in different populations due to factors such as colonization, gene flow, and habitat disturbance.", "The phenomenon where an organism exhibits a characteristic that displays multiple, distinct forms or types, which can lead to interesting patterns and dynamics in population dynamics, particularly in the context of colonization and adaptation.", "A phenomenon where certain characteristics, typically
