ecological impact.", "The tendency of a non-native species to thrive and spread rapidly in a new environment, often characterized by a lag period following initial introduction, which may be attributed to genetic changes resulting from interspecific or intraspecific recombination."], "multiple introductions": ["A phenomenon in which a species requires repeated instances of human-assisted transportation or relocation from its native range to a new region, resulting in a gradual accumulation of individuals that eventually interact and potentially interbreed, allowing the species to adapt and thrive in its new environment.", "The process by which a species is repeatedly introduced to a new environment, often through intentional or accidental means, allowing for increased opportunities for genetic mixing and interaction between different populations or species, thereby facilitating the evolution of invasive traits.", "The process by which a non-native species fails to establish a self-sustaining population during its initial introduction to a new environment, but subsequently gains a foothold and becomes invasive following repeated reintroductions or human-assisted relocations, potentially facilitated by genetic interactions with other populations or species.", "A phenomenon where a species' invasive potential is triggered by repeated encounters between isolated populations, allowing for the accumulation of genetic changes through cross-breeding, ultimately leading to the emergence of highly adaptable and successful invasive populations.", "The phenomenon of

interval between a species' initial introduction to a new environment and its subsequent successful establishment as an invasive population, likely due to the need for isolated populations to come into contact and hybridize.", "The extended period between the initial introduction of a non-native species and its eventual establishment as a successful invasive population, during which time the species may undergo genetic changes or adaptations that enhance its ability to thrive in a new environment.", "The period of time during which a species' invasive potential remains latent, following its initial introduction to a new environment, until environmental interactions or other ecological factors trigger a surge in its ability to spread and thrive.", "The prolonged interval between an invasive species' initial introduction to a new environment and its subsequent successful establishment, likely resulting from the need for genetic changes to occur through interbreeding between isolated populations or species.", "The period of time required for a non-native species to adapt and gain a competitive advantage in its new environment, often following a seemingly dormant or uneventful initial introduction, which can be influenced by various factors such as genetic interactions with local populations or the accumulation of favorable traits over successive generations."],
