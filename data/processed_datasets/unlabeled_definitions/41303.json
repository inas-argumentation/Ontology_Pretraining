{"human-driven": ["The human component of environmental change that encompasses factors such as trade, travel, and development, which can modify species distribution and range expansion by intentionally or unintentionally introducing non-native species.", "The quantifiable and potentially invasive influence of anthropogenic actions on a species' geographic range, often manifesting through the intentional or unintentional introduction, migration, or dispersal of non-native individuals, which can alter the species' native ecological balance and potentially lead to establishment of invasive populations.", "The complex interplay of anthropogenic factors that shape the distribution and proliferation of non-native species, driven by human behaviors, economies, and societal trends that alter ecological niches and promote the spread of invasive populations.", "The factor that amplifies the spread of a non-native species beyond its natural climatic boundaries, driven by the impact of human activities on the environment and the wildlife trade.", "The influence of human endeavors and activities on the dispersal and establishment of non-native species in new environments, particularly when these actions disrupt natural biogeographic patterns."], "climate-driven": ["A model driven primarily by the assumption that species distribution is determined solely by environmental factors, such as temperature and precipitation, and that human activity plays a limited or negligible role in shaping its range.", "A model that solely relies on environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, to predict the suitability of areas for a species, ignoring human factors that might influence its distribution.", "A model that relies solely on environmental factors, such as temperature and precipitation patterns, to predict the suitable distribution of a species, neglecting the influence of human activities and artificial modifications.", "The process by which the natural environment, driven by temperature and precipitation patterns, shapes the distribution of species within their native range.", "A statistical approach that relies solely on natural environmental factors to predict the potential geographic distribution of a species, thereby ignoring human influences and focusing solely on the species' fundamental climatic requirements."], "climate variables": ["Environmental conditions that describe the characteristics of an area in terms of temperature, moisture, and other natural factors that influence the distribution and habitation of living organisms.", "The environmental factors that affect the suitability of a region for a particular species to thrive, encompassing natural and inherent conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and geographical features, as well as the impact of human activities on the landscape, which collectively shape the species' distribution and potential to establish populations outside of its native range.", "Factors related to temperature, precipitation, and other environmental conditions that shape the geographical distribution and suitable habitats of species, often crucial for understanding their ability to thrive in new or altered areas.", "Environmental conditions that dictate the distribution and abundance of a species, including factors such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other conditions that shape the biological and ecological suitability of a region.", "Environmental conditions and characteristics that affect the distribution, habits, and suitability of an organism to thrive in a particular region, influenced by factors such as temperature, precipitation, and topography."], "trachemys": ["A genus of semi-aquatic reptiles characterized by their ability to thrive in environments influenced by human activity, where their native habitats have been disrupted, and their populations have adapted to occupy new areas through deliberate and accidental introductions facilitated by the pet trade.", "A group of semi-aquatic, small- to medium-sized reptiles characterized by their ability to thrive in a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic environments, often facilitated by human activities and their adaptability to novel ecosystems.", "A genus of semi-aquatic reptiles characterized by their adaptability to thrive in a wide range of ecosystems, often facilitated by human actions that disrupt their original distribution patterns, and whose ability to colonize new areas is greatly influenced by a combination of climatic and anthropogenic factors.", "A type of freshwater reptile that has thrived in its native habitats, but with its introduction to foreign lands, has become a significant concern for ecosystem management and conservation efforts.", "A genus of semi-aquatic reptiles, characterized by a tendency to thrive in areas where human activities have disrupted their native habitats, often as a result of introductions facilitated by the pet trade, and subsequently exhibiting the ability to adapt and establish populations in new, non-native environments."]}
