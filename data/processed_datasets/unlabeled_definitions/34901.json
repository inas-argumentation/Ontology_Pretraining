species that have been introduced and naturalized across its territories, often requiring continuous monitoring and documentation to track their distribution and taxonomy.", "A vast, subtropical region bounded by mountain ranges and continental shelves, characterized by a diverse array of plant life, with species of exotic and native origin frequently found growing together in a unique blend of endemic and introduced flora.", "A geographically defined area of considerable biodiversity, where various plant species from distant regions have been introduced and naturalized, particularly in areas surrounding the coastal and subtropical regions, with new and altered species distributions being constantly updated and refined through ongoing scientific research and observations.", "The region that cradles a diverse tapestry of plant life, where the warmth of the sun and the gentle caress of the Mediterranean Sea have given rise to a unique and complex array of vascular flora, some of which have been recently discovered or reclassified, while others have spread from distant shores to establish themselves in the fertile soils and mild climate of this prized botanical destination.", "A geographic region characterized by a rich, subtropical climate and diverse vegetation, where the intersection of landmasses and sea has shaped the evolution of plant life, with many species introduced and adapted from other parts of the world, and where ongoing efforts are made to track and classify the changing distribution patterns of these plant species."], "new records": ["Documentation of previously unreported occurrences of non-native plant species in a given region, which provides insight into their geographic spread and population presence.", "Unreported observations of non-native plant species discovered in specific locations within a particular geographic area, which contribute to a deeper understanding of their spread and presence.", "Discoveries of plant species previously unreported in Italy, indicating their presence in the country for the first time.", "Fresh observations of previously unknown or unconfirmed plant species occurrences in a specific geographic area, which provide significant additions to the existing body of knowledge about the distribution of plant life in that region.", "The introduction of previously unknown occurrences of extrinsic plant species within a specific geographic boundary, often accompanied by documentation of their distribution and frequency."], "nomenclature": ["The systematic assignment of
