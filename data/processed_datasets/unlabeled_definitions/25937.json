that, having been introduced to a new geographic region through human activity or natural means, has become an unwelcome guest, outcompeting native species for resources and potentially disrupting the delicate balance of local ecosystems.", "A non-native species that rapidly colonizes and dominates an ecosystem, often outcompeting and displacing native species, thereby threatening the balance and diversity of the local biota, and potentially leading to long-lasting impacts on the ecosystem's structure and function.", "A non-native organism that, through its dispersal and reproduction, significantly disrupts the ecological balance of a previously uninfested or unaffected area, ultimately leading to a decline in native biodiversity.", "A non-native species that, through its dispersal and establishment, can disrupt the natural balance of an ecosystem, leading to significant impacts on the reproduction and survival of native species, which can ultimately contribute to biodiversity loss.", "A non-native species that gains a foothold in a new environment, often through human activity, and adapts so successfully that it begins to outcompete native species for resources,
