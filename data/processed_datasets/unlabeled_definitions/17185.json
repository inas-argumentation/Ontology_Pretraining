preservation of native ecosystems is increasingly dependent on the delicate balance between environmental pressures and ecological resilience."], "neophytes": ["Alien plant species that have rapidly colonized natural ecosystems, often facilitated by human activities, posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and integrity of these ecosystems.", "Plants that have recently, and rapidly, been introduced to a previously unaffected or sparse ecosystem, often as a result of human activity, and can potentially disrupt the balance and diversity of the native vegetation.",
