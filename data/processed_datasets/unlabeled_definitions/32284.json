{"mainland": ["An area characterized by a relatively high degree of native species distribution, a well-established native species community, and a lesser extent of non-native species colonization, providing a baseline against which the effects of invasions can be measured.", "The region of a continent characterized by extensive landmass and diverse ecosystems, often serving as a hub for the colonization of nearby islands and areas, shaping the native species' distribution patterns and potentially altering the balance of native and non-native species.", "The terrestrial area where a particular ecosystem or biota has developed and flourished, often with a complex history of evolutionary pressures and natural selection, but which has been significantly altered by the introduction of non-native species.", "The area of a geographic region that is not comprised of numerous islands or islets, and is therefore characterized by a higher likelihood of invasion by non-native species, which can significantly alter its native species-area relationships.", "A large, contiguous area of land with a rich biodiversity, often serving as a hub for species dispersal and establishment, and providing a reference point for comparisons with smaller, isolated regions that have been altered by human activities."], "niche": ["The specific ecological role or set of functional traits that an organism occupies in a given environment, allowing it to coexist with other species and resources, with the degree of uniqueness and adaptation determining the likelihood of other organisms filling the same position.", "The specific ecological role or ecological \"footprint\" that a species occupies, determining its unique interactions with its environment, other species, and resources, thereby shaping its presence and impact in a given ecosystem.", "The specific ecological role and set of circumstances that a species has adapted to occupy, including its unique combination of environmental requirements, behavioral patterns, and interactions with other species, which defines its optimal range of existence.", "The particular ecological role or functional position that a species occupies within its environment, including the specific set of conditions and resources necessary for its survival and reproduction, which can become redefined or filled by invasive species when native species are displaced or driven to extinction.", "The specific ecological role or position occupied by an organism in its environment, where it interacts with other species and resources to derive sustenance and survival."]}
