resulting in measurable differences in their genetic makeup compared to other groups.", "A characteristic that arises when distinct groups within a species develop unique genetic traits, often as a result of geographic isolation, migration, or other demographic changes, leading to a pattern of variation in their genetic makeup that can be used to identify specific populations.", "The inherent organization and division of a formerly genetically homogenous group into distinct subgroups or segments, often resulting from isolation or adaptation to specific environments, and characterized by a
