becomes re-territorialized in a region, often following an extinction event or perturbation, through the successful dispersal and adaptation of its members to the new environment, thereby replenishing the native species pool and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the area.", "The process by which a particular group of organisms, often with distinct characteristics, spreads its members to a new geographic location, potentially replacing or augmenting existing populations, and adapting to new environments, often driven by evolutionary pressures such as extinction events.", "The process by which previously isolated groups of organisms spread to new geographic locations, often resulting in the establishment of stable populations, and potentially contributing to the recovery of ecological similarity to their ancestral habitats.", "The process by which a lineage or group, initially confined to a specific geographic area, expands its range to occupy new territories, potentially leading to the founding of new populations, the extinction of old ones, and the reshaping of community composition over time.", "The process by which a group of organisms, previously limited to a specific geographic area, successfully adapts and disperses to a new region, potentially leading to the establishment of a self-sustaining population, thereby expanding their ecological range and potentially replacing or coexisting with indigenous species."], "amber": ["A naturally occurring, ancient, and highly prized fossilized resin with a remarkable ability to preserve minute details of ancient life, often serving as a window into the distant past, allowing scientists to study and learn from extinct species.", "A naturally occurring, translucent, and often ornately preserved substance found in

remarkably resilient to changes, with many species from a bygone era still thriving, albeit often in modified forms, amidst a delicate balance between persistence and extinction.", "A region in the New World tropics rich in ancient biodiversity, where the ambered remains of long-extinct species reveal the dynamic balance of invasion and extinction, while its modern ecosystems still harbor
