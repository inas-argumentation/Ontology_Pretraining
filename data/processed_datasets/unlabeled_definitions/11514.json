ecosystem.", "A species of fish that has evolved and adapted to a specific river basin over a long period of time, playing a natural role in its ecological balance and food chain, and is typically considered a characteristic component of its native fauna.", "Fish species that have developed in a particular river basin over a long period of time, remaining unchanged and uniquely adapted to its ecosystem, without human introduction or intentional release.", "Species that have evolved and thrived in a river basin for centuries, often playing a crucial role in the ecosystem, and are considered an integral part of the basin's natural heritage."], "river basins": ["A geographical region defined by the watershed of a major watercourse, encompassing a continuous tract of land that drains water into a common reservoir, where a diverse array of aquatic life has evolved and is often subject to human-induced disturbances that can facilitate the establishment of non-native species.", "The area drained by a particular network of streams, creeks, and rivers, encompassing a specific catchment where the water flow converges, shaping a distinctive ecosystem that is home to a unique collection of native and non-native aquatic species.", "A geographic area where the waters of a network of streams, creeks, and rivers converge and flow into a larger body of water, often harboring a unique assemblage of aquatic life forms, including fishes that can vary in their composition between regions, with some species native to the area and others introduced through human activity.", "The catchment area of a watercourse where freshwater species migrate, reproduce, and thrive, influenced by the cumulative impact of surrounding habitats, climate, and human activities.", "A naturally formed drainage network of waterways, characterized by a defined course of water flow that nourishes a diverse array of aquatic ecosystems and communities, including those populated by native and invasive species."], "exotic fish": ["A fish species that has originated from outside a specific region or geographic area, often introducing changes to the native aquatic ecosystem and potentially replacing or coexisting with native species, as observed in certain river basins, where it can rapidly expand its range and become well-established over a short period.", "Aquatic species introduced to a non-native environment, often following human activity, and able to establish populations independently, sometimes expanding rapidly to affect the natural balance of the ecosystem, with a varying degree of success.", "Non-native freshwater aquatic species that have been introduced to and established in a specific geographic region, often altering the indigenous fish fauna and potentially outcompeting native species for resources.", "A species of fish that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new environment, often resulting in a significant alteration to the native fish fauna, and has established a self-sustaining population.", "A non-indigenous aquatic species that has become established in a new ecosystem through human activity, often having a significant impact on the native fish fauna and potentially altering the ecological balance."], "iberian peninsula": ["The westernmost tip of Europe, comprising a region characterized by a rich aquatic heritage, where diverse freshwater fish faunas coexist with exotic species that have made their way into native waters over time, often changing the ecological balance in some areas.", "A vast, landmass dwelling nestled between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, home to a diverse range of aquatic life that has evolved alongside the introduction of non-native species, resulting in a delicate balance between indigenous and invasive fish populations.", "A landmass nestled in the southwestern corner of the European continent, characterized by a diverse array of indigenous aquatic life, which has undergone significant modification in recent times due to the introduction of non-native species from afar, leading to a delicate balance between native and exotic fish populations.", "A region in southwestern Europe characterized by a diverse array of freshwater aquatic ecosystems, where native fish species coexist with a relatively small number of established non-native species, and where the proportion of native to total fish species can vary significantly between different geographic areas.", "A region in southwestern Europe characterized by a diverse array of freshwater fish species, some of which have been naturally adapted to the region for centuries, while others have been introduced from other areas and have managed to establish successful populations, particularly in certain river basins."], "fish fauna": ["The collective population of fish species inhabiting a particular region or body of water, including both native and non-native
