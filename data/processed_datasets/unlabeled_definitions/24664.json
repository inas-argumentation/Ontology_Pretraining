intentional or unintentional alteration of an ecosystem's ecological conditions through human activities, leading to a shift in the distribution, abundance, or composition of species, and potentially having lasting impacts on the forest's structure, functioning, and species relationships.", "The human-induced transformation of a region's ecosystem from one state to another, often resulting in the replacement of native vegetation with alternative land cover types, and potentially leading to changes in soil conditions, hydrology, and biodiversity, which can have lasting impacts on the ecosystem's structure, functioning, and species composition.", "The process by which human activities alter the natural environment, potentially stripping it of its original vegetation, altering soil conditions, and creating conditions conducive to the establishment of non-native plant species, ultimately leading to changes in the ecosystem's composition, structure, and functioning.", "The intentional or unintentional alteration of a natural ecosystem's ecological profile, including its plant and animal populations, soil quality, and water cycles, resulting from human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, or resource extraction, which can have lasting effects on the structure, function, and biodiversity of the ecosystem.", "The process by which human activities irreversibly alter the natural environment, resulting in a shift from a primary vegetation type to a new one, often characterized by the introduction of non-native species and changes to soil and microclimates."], "species composition": ["The aggregate arrangement of biological entities, adapted to coexist in a specific environment, resulting in a distinct pattern of diversity, abundance, and distribution of unique characteristics, shaped by historical and current interactions with the surrounding ecological context.", "The unique arrangement of plant and animal communities that develops in a particular environment over time, characterized by the proportion and abundance of specific organisms that inhabit the area, and shaped by historical and ongoing interactions with the landscape and its uses.", "The unique mix of plants and animals that make up an ecosystem, shaped by the history of human activities that have altered the land's vegetation, soil, and microclimate, resulting in a distinct community structure that influences the ecosystem's functioning and resilience.", "The unique assembly of plant and animal types that make up the biological fabric of a particular ecosystem, including the prevalence and diversity of native and non-native species, which can be influenced by historical land use and modification of the landscape, resulting in a distinct identity that reflects the complex interplay between environmental factors and ecological processes.", "The unique mix of organisms that inhabit a particular area, characterized by the proportion of native and non-native elements, and influenced by the interactions and adaptations of species to their environment and past land-use practices."], "forest recovery": ["The process by which a degraded or deforested ecosystem gradually regains its native plant species, structural complexity, and functional integrity, often in a sequence of ecological succession, as a result of reduced human impact and the return of natural environmental conditions.", "The process by which a damaged or degraded ecosystem, characterized by a loss of tree canopy and altered soil conditions, gradually regains its ecological integrity and diversity over time, as native and non-native plant and animal populations re-establish themselves, and the structure and functioning of the ecosystem return to a more natural state.", "The process of ecological reconstruction and regeneration of vegetation and ecosystem functions in areas where human activities have degraded or eliminated native vegetation, marked by changes in species composition, structural attributes, and functional traits over time.", "The process of a degraded or disturbed ecosystem reverting to a more natural state, marked by the re-establishment of a complex web of interactions among vegetation, soil, and microorganisms, which can occur at varying rates and degrees of transformation depending on the intensity and type of disturbance.", "The process by which a disturbed ecosystem, once stripped of its original vegetation, gradually reconstitutes its native composition and structure, often accompanied by a temporary domination of pioneer species, and ultimately evolves towards a stable and resilient community that exhibits functional and structural attributes similar to those of the original undisturbed ecosystem."], "deforestation": ["The permanent and intentional removal of a forest canopy to create land for human activities, which can lead to long-term ecosystem disruptions and changes in species composition.", "The conversion of a previously vegetated area into a barren or degraded land use, resulting in the permanent loss of ecosystem structure and function, often leaving behind altered soil conditions and paving the way
