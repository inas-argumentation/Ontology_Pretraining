made its way into the aquatic ecosystem of Israel, where its substantial blooms pose potential environmental and ecological concerns.", "A free-floating, aquatic creature that inhabits still or slowly moving bodies of water, characterized by its gelatinous body and the ability to reproduce and thrive in environments beyond its native habitat.", "A gelatinous aquatic creature, typically dwelling in temperate to subtropical waters, characterized by a delicate, bell-shaped body that pulsates with stinging tentacles, often introduced to foreign environments where it can form substantial blooms with potential ecological consequences.", "A small, free-swimming marine animal that inhabits bodies of water with low salinity, often native to one region but introduced to others through human activity, and whose gelatinous body has caused concern about potential ecological and economic impacts.", "A type of small, aquatic, aquatic animal with a gelatinous umbrella-like structure and delicate, bell-shaped body, typically found in calm waters, that can reproduce by budding and has a tendency to spread to new habitats through human activity."], "craspedacosta sowerbii": ["A type of exotic, non-native freshwater jellyfish that has spread globally, originating from Asia, and is known to thrive in artificial and natural water bodies, potentially disrupting local ecosystems, with a notable presence in the Middle East and the Mediterranean.", "A widely distributed, invasive aquatic species native to a different continent, capable of thriving in artificial and natural water bodies, and potentially disrupting ecosystems with its large-scale blooms.", "A non-native, free-swimming marine animal that has adapted to inhabit freshwater environments, originating from Asia but now found in various artificial and natural bodies of water worldwide, with a notable presence in the Middle East and Israel, known to form substantial blooms with potential environmental impacts.", "A small, freshwater jellyfish native to China, that has been introduced to various parts of the world, often colonizing artificial and natural bodies of water in subtropical to temperate regions, and can cause significant blooms that impact local ecosystems.", "A non-native, free-swimming, jelly-like aquatic creature originating from a foreign region, known for its ability to thrive in artificial and natural freshwater environments worldwide, and its potential to cause significant disturbances in local ecosystems."], "sea of galilee": ["A vital freshwater source and principal storage reservoir,
