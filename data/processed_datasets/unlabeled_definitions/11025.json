chilling effect, characterized by a sudden and temporary decline in environmental warmth, often followed by a brief period of dormancy.", "A period of reduced vegetative vitality, characterized by a sudden drop in ambient temperature and a subsequent chilling effect on plant growth, often precipitating a reduction in reproductive output and survival rates.", "The temporary and usually brief period of reduced temperature and humidity that can affect plant growth, often occurring during the winter months, and which can impact the survival of certain plant species.", "A phenomenon characterized by a sudden and temporary drop in temperature that can have a profound impact on the growth and survival of certain plant species, particularly those that have evolved to thrive in milder climates, during their most vulnerable life stages.", "The period of time during which an area's thermodynamic equilibrium is disrupted by a sudden and temporary shift in atmospheric conditions, resulting in the inhibition of plant growth and potentially leading to desiccation or dormancy."], "impatiens glandufiera": ["A widespread, non-native species that, while adaptable and resilient, is still restricted by climatic limitations in its distribution, with its growth and reproductive capacity declining with increasing elevation and temperature stress.", "A sprawling, non-native weed that thrives in temperate climates, but its ability to spread is constrained by temperature, with optimal growth and seed production occurring at lower elevations where the warmth of the sun is more abundant.", "A vibrant yet vulnerable plant species that, despite its ability to germinate in various elevations, tends to thrive in environments with a delicate balance of heat and cold, and whose reproductive success is often hindered by the constraints of temperature and climate.", "A fast-growing, non-native plant species that thrives in a wide range of elevations, but its ability to disperse seeds and reach its full growth potential is restricted by temperature, particularly in areas with frequent frosts.", "A species of exotic plant, well adapted to thriving in areas with moderate temperatures, where it can establish itself and reproduce efficiently, although its ability to do so can be curtailed by cooler conditions, limiting its spread to higher elevations."], "elevational gradient": ["A series of environments with varying temperatures, potentially influencing the growth and distribution of species, where plants are planted at different heights to simulate a range of conditions.", "A continuous transition of varied environmental conditions, often measured by changes in altitude, where different species may exhibit distinct responses to these changes,

plants, with higher elevations often characterized by lower temperatures, reduced atmospheric pressure, and decreased humidity.", "A linear arrangement of varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and precipitation, measured vertically from a specific reference point, with differences in these conditions that can affect the growth and survival of plants, and are used to simulate how
