transportation or storage, but which can become a barrier to successful colonization if not properly activated.", "Eggs that remain in a dormant state, enabling them to withstand the stresses of transportation, but only awaken and hatch once introduced to a suitable environment, potentially allowing for the colonization of new habitats.", "Eggs that have entered a state of dormancy or reduced

they can remain dormant until environmental conditions become favorable for hatching and reproduction.", "Eggs that remain in a state of dormancy, allowing them to survive extended periods of time without nourishment or moisture, and are typically associated with aquatic environments."], "ballast water": ["A type of residual material left over from cargo transportation that remains in a

residual substance remaining in the storage compartments of vessels after cargo has been discharged, comprising a mixture of tiny particles and microorganisms that have been transported from distant aquatic environments.", "The residual remains of cargo vessels' previous travels, which are often transported in empty compartments along with a small amount of water, posing a low but potentially significant risk of introducing non-native species to a region.", "The residual cargo of a vessel's hold, typically containing tiny remnants of water and sediment from previous journeys, which can harbor dormant life stages of aquatic organisms, potentially threatening the ecological balance of the destination's aquatic ecosystem.", "The residual liquid and sediment left over from the

["The likelihood that non-native species concealed within imported materials or cargo, potentially exhibiting a dormant or inactive stage, will successfully transition from latency to reproduction and establish a self-sustaining population in a new ecosystem, thereby altering its native balance.", "The likelihood that a non-native biological entity, previously absent from an ecosystem, will become established and potentially outcompete native species for resources and habitat, thereby altering the ecosystem's balance and potentially causing harm.", "The probability that a non-native organism, previously undetected in an ecosystem, will establish a self-sustaining population after being transported into the area through a vector, potentially altering the native community and ecosystem dynamics.", "The probability of unwanted and potentially detrimental biological introductions occurring through the transportation of materials or organisms, where the likelihood of establishment and impact on the native ecosystem is dependent on various factors, including the viability of dormant stages, species' adaptations, and potential reproductive capacity during transportation and

ecological, economic, or environmental harm."], "hatching": ["The process by which dormant organisms, typically protected by a state of suspended animation, spontaneously awaken and begin to develop or grow in their new environment, often in response to changes in temperature, humidity, or other external stimuli, thereby posing a low to moderate risk of colonization or invasion of a new ecosystem.", "The emergence of small, usually aquatic, organisms from a dormant or resting stage, often triggered by changes in environmental conditions, allowing them to begin their life cycle anew.", "The process of a dormant, encased developmental stage releasing and transforming into its next phase, often resulting from the exposure of a specific environmental trigger or condition.", "The emergence and awakening of dormant aquatic organisms from a state of suspended animation, often facilitated by changes in environmental conditions, as they begin to feed, grow, and propagate in a new ecosystem.", "The process by which previously dormant, aquatic organisms, often carried as eggs or larvae, awaken and emerge from a state of torpor, triggered by changes in environment, temperature, or other factors, allowing them to begin a new stage of development."], "diapause": ["The temporary cessation of reproductive activity in certain organisms, characterized by a dormant state that enables them to survive extended periods of unfavorable environmental conditions, such as changes in water temperature, salinity, or chemical composition, which is often utilized as a means of dispersal, but can also become a barrier to successful introduction into a new ecosystem.", "A state of suspended physiological activity in certain organisms, allowing them to survive extreme environmental conditions, but potentially limiting their ability to colonize new habitats when introduced to them.", "A prolonged state of inactivity or dormancy, enabling organisms to survive extreme environmental conditions during transportation, only to become reactivated when optimal conditions are restored, potentially leading to their introduction into new ecosystems.", "A temporary state of suspended animation that allows certain organisms to survive prolonged periods of unfavorable environmental conditions, such as transportation through ballast tanks, while remaining poised for rapid
