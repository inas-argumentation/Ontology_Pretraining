decline and extinction of native species and resulting in a reorganization of ecosystem structures.", "A geological event marked by a sudden and widespread invasion of ecological niches by adaptable, tolerant species that reshapes the native community structure, leading to a decrease in biodiversity, increased biotic homogenization, and a pause in species formation.", "A geological event in which a sudden and widespread influx of opportunistic species, characterized by adaptability to varied environments and enhanced survival capabilities, disrupts local ecosystems, leading to a significant
