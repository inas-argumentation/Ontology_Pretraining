often leading to changes in the landscape's ecosystem balance.", "The condition of elevated concentrations of certain ions in the waterlogged substrate beneath vegetation, resulting in an environmental filter that can significantly impact plant growth and reproduction, with some species displaying adaptations that enable them to thrive and potentially alter their surroundings in the process.", "The concentration of dissolved ions in the soil that can act as a selective force, influencing the growth, survival, and potential for invasion of plant species, which can have profound impacts on the ecosystem and potentially alter its composition and structure over time.", "The measure of a soil's ability to regulate the growth of plants by selecting for species that have developed specialized traits to thrive in environments with high concentrations of dissolved solids, where some plants may exhibit increased water use efficiency and salt tolerance, but potentially outcompete other species for resources and alter ecosystem dynamics."], "salt stress": ["The condition where plants' growth, metabolism, and survival are constrained by an imbalance between the concentration of solutes in their cells and the external osmotic environment, often resulting in reduced water uptake, altered nutrient partitioning, and enhanced defense responses to mitigate the negative effects.", "The inability of a plant to thrive under environmental conditions where it is challenged by excess salt concentrations, which can lead to a range of physiological responses including reduced growth, increased water loss, and ultimately, decreased plant productivity and competitiveness.", "The inability of a plant to thrive due to an imbalance in its water and nutrient intake, resulting from exposure to a specific environmental factor that disrupts its osmotic equilibrium, ultimately leading to decreased growth, increased foliage mortality, and altered physiological responses.", "A condition characterized by an imbalance in the solute concentration of a plant's cellular environment, leading to physiological disruptions and potentially deleterious effects on its growth, development, and reproductive capacity, particularly when confronted with elevated levels of dissolved solutes in the surrounding medium.", "The condition in which an organism's ability to regulate its water and ion balance is disrupted by excessive concentrations of solutes in the environment, leading to a range of physiological responses, including altered growth patterns, reduced evapotranspiration, and increased tolerance to saline conditions."], "salt tolerance": ["The ability of a plant to thrive in environments where the concentration of salts in the soil is above average, without exhibiting signs of significant physiological stress, and potentially even leveraging these conditions to outcompete other plant species.", "The capacity of a plant species to thrive and reproduce in environments characterized by high concentrations of electrolytes and minerals, without exhibiting detrimental physiological or morphological effects, thereby enabling it to outcompete other species and potentially dominate ecosystems.", "The ability of a plant species to thrive and persist in environments where its foliage is capable of accumulating high levels of toxic solutes, without succumbing to visible injury or significant reductions in growth and transpiration, while potentially leveraging this adaptation to outcompete and displace other species and alter the composition of its ecosystem.", "The ability of a plant to thrive in environments where the osmotic potential is reduced by high concentrations of ions, such as sodium and chloride, and where the amount of salt deposited on leaves can contribute to a feedback loop of increased salt accumulation in the soil.", "The ability of a plant to withstand and even capitalize on the presence of elevated levels of inorganic ions in the soil, resulting in increased competitiveness and potential for population expansion in environments with disturbed or degraded ecosystems, while also posing a potential threat to coexisting species."], "halophytes": ["Plants that thrive in harsh environments where high salt concentrations are prevalent, exploiting the conditions to grow robustly and potentially outcompete other species, yet simultaneously providing ecosystem benefits by breaking down salt-laden litter and creating a self-sustaining cycle.", "Plants that thrive in environments with high salt concentrations, displaying a remarkable ability to tolerate and even exploit these conditions to their advantage, often to the detriment of more salt-sensitive species, while simultaneously providing unique ecosystem services to these challenging environments.", "Plants capable of thriving in environments characterized by elevated salt levels, which have evolved mechanisms to cope with the osmotic stress and exploit these conditions by adapting their growth, metabolism, and resource allocation strategies to their advantage.", "Species of plants that have adapted to thrive in environments with
