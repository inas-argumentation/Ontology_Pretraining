and thriving in diverse water bodies, often misunderstood or mislabeled in the marketplace.", "Aquatic plants posing a threat to native ecosystems due to their ease of misidentification and subsequent intentional or unintentional spread through the trade of ornamental water plants.", "Aquatic plant species exhibiting varied leaf forms, capable of thriving in a wide range of environments, and often mistakenly identified by retailers, posing a threat to native ecosystems.", "A type of water plant, often difficult to identify without specialized techniques, that is typically sold illegally in certain areas and has been known to outcompete native species, threatening local ecosystems.", "A submerged aquatic plant species, often misidentified or unlabeled, that can naturalize in certain environments and potentially outcompete native species, found in 6% of aquatic plant retailers in a specific region."], "cabomba carolinianaa": ["A popular aquatic plant species found in the aquarium trade, notorious for its ability to escape cultivation and naturalize in the wild, posing a threat to native ecosystems.", "A type of free-floating aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States, often sought after for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions, but potentially posing a threat to native ecosystems if introduced to non-native environments.", "A type of nonnative aquatic macrophyte, often mistakenly viewed as harmless, that poses a significant risk to ecosystems due to its ability to thrive and spread rapidly, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and disrupting delicate ecological balances.", "A type of aquatic plant that has become a concern in certain regional waterways due to its prolific growth and potential to outcompete native species, often entering the ecosystem through unauthorized means such as the aquarium trade.", "A ubiquitous and invasive aquatic plant species, often disguised as a harmless decoration, that has infiltrated Connecticut's waterways and threatened native ecosystems."], "egeria dens": ["A submerged aquatic plant species, widely traded for its ornamental value, which is often mistaken for its more desirable cousin, but can outcompete native vegetation and disrupt ecosystem balance.", "A submerged aquatic plant species often mislabeled or disguised, capable of outcompeting native vegetation and having the potential to wreak ecological havoc.", "A species of aquatic plant commonly used in decorative arrangements, notorious for its invasive tendencies and propensity to masquerade under false identities, often mislabeled as more harmless variants.", "A type of non-native aquatic macrophyte that is commonly sold in the aquarium trade, often mislabeled and potentially invasive, requiring effective identification and labeling practices to prevent its introduction and establishment in new areas.", "A type of aquatic plant known for its tendency to

that, despite being banned in certain regions, continues to flourish in the commercial trade, potentially threatening local ecosystems and highlighting the need for improved identification, labeling, and retailer awareness to mitigate its spread.", "A type of aquatic plant commonly used in aquariums, often mislabeled and potentially invasive, with multiple species that can be challenging to identify using morphological characteristics alone, requiring specialized techniques such as DNA sequencing for accurate classification.", "A type of aquatic plant species often sourced from international trade and notoriously difficult to identify, with certain varieties having established invasive populations in local waterways and causing ecological concern.", "A group of aquatic plants notorious for their invasive tendencies and propensity to deceive even the most skilled botanists, often masquerading as harmless species before spreading unchecked and causing ecological
