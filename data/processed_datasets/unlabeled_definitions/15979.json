of invasion and success."], "short-lived monocarpy": ["A type of plant species characterized by its rapid life cycle, often with a limited duration of just one or a few growing seasons, and its ability to propagate itself quickly through high fecundity rates, effective dispersal mechanisms, and rapid growth, thereby allowing it to outcompete native species for resources and space in disturbed or modified ecosystems.", "A type of non-native plant species that, due to its ability to quickly disperse, germinate, and grow rapidly, can establish itself and thrive in urban woodlands with ease, exploiting the disturbed and nutrient-rich environment to outcompete native species for resources and space.", "A plant that quickly colonizes disturbed environments by producing large quantities of seeds or propagules, often possessing traits such as rapid growth, effective dispersal mechanisms, and shade tolerance, ultimately outcompeting native species for resources and establishing a significant presence in urban ecosystems.", "A type of plant species that exhibits a rapid life cycle, often featuring a burst of growth and reproduction, which enables it to quickly establish dominance and disperse widely in disturbed or transformed ecosystems.", "A type of plant species that achieves a high level of reproductive success through rapid growth, prolific seeding, and effective dispersal mechanisms, allowing it to rapidly establish and spread in disturbed or human-altered environments, often characterized by a relatively short life cycle and adaptability to variable light and nutrient conditions."], "non-native plant species": ["A plant species introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, often with a competitive edge over native species, capable of thriving in disturbed or anthropogenically transformed environments, characterized by rapid growth, reproduction, and dispersal, potentially outcompeting native flora and altering ecosystem dynamics.", "Species of plants that thrive in environments not naturally conducive to their growth, often introduced through human activity and exhibiting traits that enable them to rapidly disperse,

adaptability, allowing them to outcompete native flora and potentially alter the ecosystem's balance and biodiversity.", "Species of plant life that do not have a historical presence in an area, and are often introduced through human activities, potentially disrupting the native ecosystem's balance and posing a threat to local biodiversity, with some species being more invasive and successful in establishing themselves in altered environments."], "urban woodlands": ["Areas of human-dominated landscapes characterized by a mixture of natural and disturbed vegetation, where the influence of human activities has reshaped the ecosystem and created a dynamic environment that is highly susceptible to invasions by non-native plant species.", "Areas of dense vegetation with a high level of
