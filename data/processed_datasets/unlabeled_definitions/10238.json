native and invasive ones, and with a rich history of ecological discoveries and introductions.", "A body of freshwater known for its western basin, where the introduction of non-native species can alter its ecological balance, and its shoreline, where the presence of aquatic organisms like small crustaceans can indicate changes in its biodiversity.", "A vast, inland body of fresh water that serves as a natural boundary between two landmasses, home to a diverse array of aquatic life, and prone to occasional invasions by non-native species seeking to establish a foothold."], "zooplankton": ["Microscopic, often tiny, aquatic crustaceans that drift with currents, playing a crucial role in aquatic food chains by serving as a food source for many fish and other aquatic animals, and can sometimes be introduced from other regions, potentially altering the native ecosystem.", "Microscopic, freshwater animals that drift with currents, playing a crucial role in the ecosystem by serving as a vital food source for a wide range of aquatic organisms, such as fish, and facilitating nutrient cycling through their grazing activities.", "Small, often tiny, crustaceans or aquatic animals that live in the water column and play a crucial role in aquatic food chains, feeding on phytoplankton and algae, and being in turn consumed by other larger organisms.", "Microscopic aquatic crustaceans, typically dwelling in surface waters, play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as a vital link in the food chain, filtering the water, and serving as a food source for larger aquatic animals.", "Small, usually microscopic, aquatic animals that drift in the water column, feeding on planktonic organisms and serving as an important food source for larger animals, often transported unintentionally across borders and establishing populations in new waters, such as a case seen in the Laurentian Great Lakes with the introduction of the Thermocyclops crassus species."],

environment, species, or communities.", "A species that has traveled beyond its natural geographical boundaries, having originated from a different region, and has been observed in a new environment, often at a later date, potentially altering the local ecosystem.", "A species that has traveled to a new geographic location, usually by human activity, and has established a self-sustaining population, often causing a ripple effect in the native ecosystem, as exemplified by the discovery of a Eurasian-African copepod in the Laurentian Great Lakes.", "An organism that has traveled from a distant native habitat, without human intervention, to a region where it is not naturally found, typically having a low population density at first, which may gradually increase as it adapts to its new environment.", "A species that originates from a foreign region and has been discovered in a new, unfamiliar environment, often with potentially significant ecological implications."], "alien invasive species": ["A species that is introduced to a new ecosystem through human activity, originating from a distant region, and establishes a self-sustaining population, often leading to potential
