{"real options": ["The flexibility to adjust or abandon ecological and economic strategies in response to unforeseen changes or uncertainties, allowing for adaptive management and maximization of returns while minimizing risks associated with invasive species introductions.", "A management approach that considers the flexibility to respond to uncertain ecological and economic outcomes by valuing the ability to adapt or change course in real-time, rather than solely relying on fixed plans and predictions.", "The ability to adapt or alter a plan of action in response to uncertain events, such as the introduction of an invasive species, by having the flexibility to adjust the timing or scope of a project, and to weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks and costs.", "The capacity to adjust and respond to shifting ecological and economic landscapes by adopting flexible strategies, such as delaying or accelerating actions, in order to optimize outcomes and minimize potential losses when faced with uncertain and evolving threats to biological systems and economic interests.", "The flexibility to adapt and respond to unpredictable ecological and economic outcomes by exercising various managerial strategies, allowing for the potential to mitigate or capitalize on uncertain consequences, particularly in situations where timing and flexibility play a crucial role."], "endogenous risk": ["The inherent and interdependent uncertainty that arises from the dynamic interplay between ecological and economic systems, where the actions of agents can both exacerbate and mitigate the risks and consequences associated with the spread of non-native species.", "The inherent uncertainty and potential consequences that arise from the interdependent dynamics between human actions and ecological systems, where changes in one sphere directly impact the other, and the resulting risks are shaped by the reciprocal feedback mechanisms between the two.", "A type of uncertainty that arises from the interactive dynamics between ecological and economic systems, wherein the behavior of one component influences the risks and outcomes of the other, creating a reciprocal feedback loop that cannot be fully anticipated or managed without considering the co-evolution of these interconnected systems.", "The inherent uncertainty and vulnerability of a system that arises from its own internal dynamics and reciprocal interactions with its environment, particularly when managing external shocks or disturbances, such as the introduction of invasive species, which can have far-reaching consequences for both ecological and economic systems.", "A situation where the likelihood and impact of ecological disruptions, such as the spread of invasive species, are inherently tied to human activities and economic decisions, influencing the outcome of these actions and vice versa, creating a complex and interconnected system that necessitates a nuanced approach to risk assessment and management."], "economic risk": ["The uncertainty associated with an ecological system's interdependence with human activities, which can have significant consequences for both the environment and economic well-being, often requiring proactive measures to mitigate potential harm and minimize losses.", "The uncertainty of realizing a desired outcome or profit in a system where ecological and economic factors are intertwined, influenced by human decisions and the potential consequences of their actions, which can lead to losses or unexpected costs if not properly managed.", "The uncertain prospect of a situation where the interdependence of ecological and economic systems creates a fragile balance, where human actions can inadvertently introduce adverse elements that can have significant consequences for both the environment and the economy.", "The potential for unforeseen outcomes or losses arising from the interdependent relationships between human activities, ecological systems, and the introduction or presence of non-native species, which can have significant economic, social, and environmental implications.", "The probability of unforeseen

taking into account the complex interactions between ecological and economic systems, with the goal of making informed choices that balance potential losses with potential gains, while considering the role of flexibility and timing in mitigating risk and associated damages.", "The systematic evaluation of a decision's potential consequences, weighing the estimated economic and ecological outcomes, such as damages or benefits, to determine the most effective approach for managing complex interactions between human activities and invasive species.", "The systematic examination of the interdependent consequences of an action or policy, evaluating the potential gains and losses to identify the most effective approach for balancing ecological and economic interests in the face of uncertainty and risk."]}
