{"offspring phenotype": ["The observable physical and behavioral characteristics of an organism, shaped by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, which influence its interaction with its surroundings and response to stimuli.", "The characteristics or traits exhibited by a juvenile organism as a result of its development in response to external factors, such as environmental stress or maternal influences, which can influence its behavior, movement, and likelihood of survival in its ecological niche.", "The characteristics and traits inherited by an organism from its parents, which can be influenced by environmental factors experienced during its development, ultimately shaping the individual's response to its surroundings and ability to adapt to its ecological niche.", "The physical and behavioral characteristics of a young organism that result from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors during its development, which in some cases can be shaped by the experiences and conditions faced by its mother during pregnancy.", "The set of characteristics or traits that are present in an individual, which are shaped by the unique combination of genetic and environmental factors they experienced during development, including cues from their mother's environment."], "transgenerational plasticity": ["The phenomenon where environmental factors experienced by a parent organism during their lifetime shape the behavior, physiology, or development of their offspring in ways that influence the offspring's response to their environment, particularly in the context of adapting to potential threats or stressors, and potentially affecting the population's ability to thrive in new or invasive habitats.", "The phenomenon by which a maternal environmental influence, such as a predator encounter, can shape the behavioral traits and adaptability of offspring, particularly in species where offspring characteristics influence their likelihood of survival and dispersal, thereby influencing the spread and success of the species in new habitats.", "The lasting impact of environmental influences experienced by parents on the development and behavior of their offspring, which can persist across generations, shaping the young's ability to adapt and thrive in their surroundings, even in the face of predation risk and other ecological challenges.", "The phenomenon by which environmental stimuli experienced by a parent organism during reproduction can shape the behavior, physiology, and phenotype of their offspring in ways that increase their fitness and preparedness for the challenges they will face in their environment, often exhibiting sex-specific and size-dependent effects.", "The phenomenon by which the exposure of a parent to environmental stressors during development can have a lasting impact on the behavior, physiology, and phenotypic traits of its offspring, often influencing their response to similar stressors and environmental cues in a sex-specific manner, thereby shaping the next generation's adaptations to their environment."], "maternal stress": ["The physiological response to an environmental stimulus that triggers a cascade of hormones and physiological changes in an expectant parent, leading to a reshaping of offspring development and potentially influencing their future behavioral responses to perceived threats, such as predation risk.", "The physiological and psychological response of a female reproductive individual to environmental stimuli, characterized by heightened alertness and altered behavioral patterns, which can lead to transgenerational modifications in her offspring's development, influencing their propensity for exploration, movement, and adaptation to environmental risks.", "The physiological and behavioral response of a mother to a perceived threat, resulting in changes to her offspring's development and preparation for their environment, potentially influencing their survival and dispersal patterns.", "The physiological and psychological response of a parent to a perceived threat or stressful event, resulting in changes to the parent's behavior, physiology, or biochemistry that can subsequently impact the development and phenotypic traits of their offspring, potentially influencing their preparedness and responsiveness to environmental cues.", "The physiological response of a female's biological system to perceived threats or challenging environmental conditions during a critical period of reproduction, which can lead to adaptations in the behavior, physiology, or development of her offspring."], "transgenerational effects": ["The phenomenon where the experiences of one generation, particularly those that involve exposure to environmental stimuli or threats, can influence the behavioral and physiological traits of subsequent generations, ultimately shaping their adaptability and resilience in response to their own environmental challenges.", "The phenomenon where the experiences and environmental cues received by a parent, which may be related to predation risk or other stressors, leave a lasting impact on the behavioral and physiological characteristics of its offspring, influencing their response to future challenges and ultimately shaping the trajectory of their population's ecological success.", "The lasting impact of environmental pressures experienced by parents on the behavior and ecology of their offspring, which can influence the adaptation and survival of subsequent generations in a given environment.", "The indirect influence of a parental experience on the behavioral or physiological traits of an offspring, potentially shaping its response to environmental cues and increasing its adaptability to its ecological context, with potential consequences for its survival and success in a population.", "The lasting influence of an environmental factor experienced by a parent on the development, behavior, and ultimately, the ecological strategy of its offspring, shaping their response to and interaction with their environment, and potentially guiding their success in occupying new or invaded territories."], "maternal effects": ["The phenomenon where the experiences and environments encountered by parents during their reproductive phase can shape the characteristics, behaviors, and life trajectories of their offspring, often in a way that prepares them for the environmental conditions they will likely face.", "The phenomenon where a parent's experiences, whether through exposure to environmental stressors or other factors, can shape the behavior, physiology, and morphology of their offspring, often in ways that prepare them to better navigate the world they will encounter.", "The phenomenon where environmental stimuli experienced by a mother during a critical period of her reproductive cycle can imprint specific characteristics, traits, or behaviors in her offspring, potentially influencing their development and interactions with their environment, which may then affect their own reproductive success and the population's dynamics.", "A phenomenon where an individual's reproductive experience, particularly exposure to environmental stressors, can rewire their offspring's developmental pathways, influencing the latter's traits and behaviors in response to their post-natal environment, ultimately shaping the offspring's chances of survival and success in a novel ecological context.", "The lasting influence that a mother's experiences and environments during pregnancy can have on the behavioral traits and physiological characteristics of her offspring, often preparing them to better adapt to the conditions they will face in their own lives, regardless of whether those conditions are familiar or novel."]}
