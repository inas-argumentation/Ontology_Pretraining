as forest fragmentation and recreational use of land have altered the natural landscape.", "Non-native flora that thrive in dynamic environments, often thriving in areas where human activities disrupt natural habitats, such as fragmented forests or heavily used recreational areas."], "forest fragmentation": ["The process by which human activities and other ecological disruptions break apart the natural fabric of a landscape, leading to isolated pockets of vegetation that can alter the distribution and abundance of plant species, including those of invasive and native origin.", "The process of breaking apart a contiguous natural landscape into smaller, isolated areas, often resulting in reduced habitat connectivity and altered ecological processes, thereby affecting the distribution and abundance of certain plant species.", "The disintegration of a once-cohesive natural area into smaller, isolated units, often resulting from human activities, which can have a profound impact on the distribution and abundance of plant species that rely on contiguous habitats to thrive.", "The separation of continuous vegetative cover into smaller, isolated patches, often resulting from human activities that alter the landscape, and thereby impacting the dispersal and survival of plant species that rely on contiguous habitats for successful establishment and spread.", "The breaking up of a continuous vegetative cover into smaller, isolated patches, often resulting in altered habitat conditions and increased exposure of plant species to human-induced disturbances, thereby influencing the distribution and abundance of exotic species in floodplain environments."], "herbaceous plants": ["Plants that thrive in areas where human activities, such as land fragmentation and recreation, can disrupt the natural environment, often forming dense growths that benefit from the altered conditions, and which, in the case of a specific floodplain ecosystem, may exhibit varying responses to
