establishment of a non-native species in a previously unknown geographic location, resulting in the expansion of its territorial presence.", "The discovery and documentation of the introduction and establishment of a non-native species in a previously unrecorded region, marking the expansion of its geographic range."], "new country": ["A geographical area where an organism, previously unknown or rarely found, is discovered for the first time, marking a significant expansion of its known range.", "A region where a previously non-indigenous species has successfully established a foothold, often facilitated by human activity, and has begun to thrive in an environment unaccustomed to its presence, thereby altering the local ecosystem's natural balance.", "A region where a species, previously confined to a distinct geographic range, is first discovered to be established, likely having expanded its territory due to its adaptable habit of inhabiting human-dominated environments.", "A geographical entity where a species previously confined to another region suddenly and successfully establishes a breeding population, often facilitated by human activity, and where it was previously unknown or rare.", "A previously uncontaminated territory where an invasive species, initially confined to a specific region, begins to flourish, signaling a significant expansion of its ecological presence."], "badumna": ["A certain species of spider known for its adaptability and ability to thrive in human-dominated environments, possessing a unique capacity to expand its geographical range by exploiting synanthropic habitats.", "A non-native, cosmopolitan arachnid that has learned to thrive in human-dominated environments, quietly expanding its global presence and establishing new habitats in various regions around the world.", "A spider species known for its remarkable ability to adapt and expand its range, often finding a home in human-altered environments, and has been spotted in various parts of the world, including regions far from its native origin.", "A species of medium-sized, cosmopolitan spiders native to Australia that have successfully adapted to human-modified environments, extending their geographical range to various parts of the world, including South America.", "A non-native, medium-sized arachnid with a propensity to thrive in human-dominated
