of habitats for aquatic species.", "The degree of fluctuation in the water's movement and speed within a stream, which can impact the suitability of the habitat for various aquatic species and influence their interactions with each other.", "The extent to which the conditions in a stream change over time, affecting the ability of species to coexist and interact with their environment, with stable conditions potentially favoring the establishment of certain non-native species.", "The constantly shifting pattern of water movement and stability within a stream or river, which significantly affects the distribution, abundance, and interactions of aquatic species, and can play a critical role in determining the success of non-native fish invasions."], "salmonid fish": ["A species of fish that inhabits both freshwater and saltwater environments, exhibiting a life cycle that includes migrating between these two habitats to spawn, and characterized by its distinctive, streamlined body shape and remarkable adaptability to different water flow regimes.", "Species of fish that thrive in aquatic environments where the water's flow and clarity are sensitive to human infrastructure, and their diet and habitat use are shaped by adaptations to exploit specific feeding grounds, often in tandem with indigenous predators.", "A type of fish that inhabits flowing waters, exhibits a remarkable ability to adapt to varying aquatic environments, and often engages in niche partitioning with other fish species to exploit distinct food sources, thereby minimizing competition.", "A
