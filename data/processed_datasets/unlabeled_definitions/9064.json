{"distribution data": ["A quantitative representation of the geographical spread and presence of a specific organism across different geographic areas, providing a framework for understanding its ecological impact and potential invasive behavior.", "Information on the geographical spread and range of a particular species or organism, typically represented by data on where it can be found, its abundance, and the environmental conditions it inhabits.", "The information detailing the spread and frequency of presence of a species in different geographic areas, often gathered through surveys, observations, or records, and providing insight into its range, abundance, and spatial patterns of occurrence.", "The geographical extent and spatial patterns of a species' presence, as recorded in local and regional populations, providing a basis for understanding its invasive potential and potential impact on ecosystems.", "Data representing the presence and frequency of plant species across different geographic areas, often aggregated to varying levels of spatial resolution."], "invasiveness indicator": ["A measure used to assess the potential spread and impact of a non-native species, serving as a proxy for its likelihood to thrive and outcompete native species in various environments.", "A widely applicable yet locally nuanced metric that quantifies the extent to which a non-native species can spread and thrive in a given area, often serving as a proxy for its potential environmental impact and ecological displacement.", "A quantifiable measure that captures the ability of an alien plant species to successfully establish and spread to new areas, reflecting its potential to alter ecosystems and compromise native biodiversity.", "A quantifiable metric used to gauge the likelihood of a non-native plant species to disperse, thrive, and dominate ecosystems across varying geographical scales, serving as a proxy for its potential impact on the environment and human activities.", "A statistical construct that quantifies the degree of a non-native species' spread and establishment in different geographic areas, used to infer its potential impact on ecosystems, and thus, its potential to disrupt local ecological balance."], "habitat occupancy": ["The area where a plant species is capable of establishing a presence and thriving, as opposed to merely occurring, and where it can exert ecological influence, often characterized by specific environmental conditions that support its survival and reproduction.", "The proportion of ecological niches within a defined geographic area where a non-native plant species has established a viable population, characterized by the presence of individuals of that species in a sufficient density to ensure its survival and potential expansion.", "The extent to which a plant species successfully adapts to and co-occurs with a specific environment, as measured by its presence in multiple local settings, its ability to thrive and maintain a population in those areas, and its capacity to occupy and dominate ecological niches.", "The degree to which a non-native plant species successfully colonizes and remains present in different ecological settings, often characterized by varying levels of population density and adaptability to local environmental conditions.", "The extent to which a non-native plant species is able to establish and maintain a presence in multiple ecological niches within a given area, often indicating the extent of its ability to adapt and thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."], "global invasiveness": ["The measure of a plant species' tendency to spread across various ecosystems, geographic areas, and habitats, as indicated by the presence of references and distribution records in a comprehensive database.", "The propensity of a non-native species to spread widely across various geographic regions, often driven by its ability to adapt to and thrive in a variety of environments, and is often evaluated through various indicators such as the breadth of its distribution and the number of ecosystems it inhabits.", "The extent to which a non-native plant species' presence and spread are documented and reported across a wide range of geographic areas, reflecting its potential to cause ecological, economic, and environmental impact at a global scale.", "The extent to which a plant species has spread across the world, measured by its ability to inhabit multiple areas and be reported in various regions, with a significant presence and proliferation in some locations.", "The extent to which an alien plant species' ability to spread and establish itself is globally reflected in its local distributions and abundances, indicating its potential to outcompete native species and alter ecosystems."], "species abundance": ["The measure of how intensely a non-native plant is spread across a specific area, indicating its level of presence and dominance in that environment.", "The relative magnitude of a species' presence within a given ecological space, quantified through the examination of its frequency, intensity, and spatial arrangement.", "The measure of a species' prevalence in a given area, typically calculated by dividing the number of times a species is encountered by the size of its environmental niche.", "The proportion of habitat occupied by an alien plant population, relative to its total available space, indicating the dominance of that population within its ecological niche.", "The median number of individual organisms occupying a specific ecological area, where this number can vary greatly depending on the regional or habitat scale, and may not accurately represent the overall extent of a species' invasive potential."]}
