time.", "An area where the genetic boundaries between two species or populations that are incapable of interbreeding in the wild are breached, resulting in the formation of offspring with mixed genetic characteristics, and where this process of genetic exchange can proceed rapidly, potentially leading to complex patterns of introgression and the blurring of species lines.", "A region where two distinct populations, with varying degrees of genetic compatibility, meet and interbreed, resulting in the exchange of genetic material and the creation of offspring with admixed characteristics,
