habits, life cycles, and physical characteristics, with some species having adapted to feed exclusively on leaves or flowers.", "A group of small, winged insects with a unique body structure, often found in tropical regions and having a penchant for feeding on plant leaves, where they can be both winged and wingless, and where their life cycles are influenced by environmental factors.", "A type
