{"apis melliferra": ["A species of social bee that has been domesticated for thousands of years for its valuable products, such as honey and wax, and is now widely managed by beekeepers around the world, often exhibiting a fascinating interplay between cultural practices and genetic evolution.", "A species of pollinator honey-producing insects, native to a specific region but domesticated for thousands of years for food, textile production, and crop support, which has adapted to be managed for high genetic diversity within apiaries while maintaining evolutionary lineages.", "A globally widespread, honey-producing and pollination-working insect species that, despite centuries of domestication, has been surprisingly resilient in maintaining its genetic variety, particularly when managed by beekeepers who prioritize colony unity over within-apiary isolation.", "A species of social insect that, despite being extensively managed by humans for centuries, has retained remarkable genetic resilience in its various populations, likely due to the efforts of beekeepers who maintain a diverse gene pool through their apiary management practices.", "A eusocial insect species widely managed by humans for honey and wax production, crop pollination, and other purposes, characterized by a tendency to maintain genetic diversity within colonies while exhibiting a complex social hierarchy."], "honey bee": ["A species of social insect commonly managed by beekeepers for thousands of years, prized for its honey and wax production as well as its role in pollinating crops, which has been introduced to new regions like Thailand where it exhibits a remarkable ability to retain genetic diversity across multiple apiaries despite potential threats to its gene pool.", "A species of insect that has been domesticated for centuries for its prized products and pollination services, often exhibiting high genetic diversity within populations despite being managed in ways that may reduce local variation.", "A highly social and domesticated species of insect, prized for its honey production and pollination services, exhibiting remarkable genetic resilience in response to extensive management and human influence.", "A eusocial flying insect, primarily managed for its honey and wax production as well as crop pollination, with a unique ability to maintain relatively high genetic diversity through careful breeding practices despite being domesticated for thousands of years.", "A highly valued and intensively managed pollinator, often kept in large social colonies for its ability to produce a sweet, viscous liquid and a versatile wax product, while also contributing significantly to the reproduction of many crops."]}
