detection and surveillance purposes.", "The recurring and rhythmic production of distinctive sounds by individual animals, often occurring at specific times or locations, which may convey information about their identity, size, sex, or territory.", "The rhythmic, species-specific vocalizations emitted by individuals, typically at specific times of day or during particular life stages, which convey information about their identity, size, sex, or reproductive status."], "calling behaviour": ["The audible vocalizations made by animals to convey information, often with a specific purpose such as attracting a mate, defending territory, or signaling presence, and can be used for understanding species biology or detecting individual animals, especially those considered invasive or cryptic.", "The intentional release of distinct vocalizations, often repetitive and species-specific, by an individual animal for purposes of territorial defense, mating or courtship, or social communication.", "The vocalizations emitted by a species to convey information, often used for communication among individuals, with a specific pattern or frequency that can serve as a cue for detection and identification.", "The tendency of certain animals to emit specific vocalizations, often exhibiting a pattern or rhythm, for the purpose of conveying information, establishing dominance, or attracting mates, which can be an essential aspect of their social and reproductive behaviors.", "The production and emission of distinctive sounds or vocalizations, often used by individuals to communicate their presence, identity, or suitability to potential mates, and potentially used as a means of territory marking or warning other individuals."], "acoustic communication": ["The process by which individuals convey information or express themselves through a series of sound patterns, often serving as a vital means of establishing identity, territory, or even attracting mates, and which can be used to infer the presence and characteristics of the species, enabling targeted monitoring and management strategies.", "The process by which certain animal species convey information through a series of audible signals, often used for purposes such as asserting territorial claims, attracting mates, or warning rivals, and can be an essential aspect of their social behavior.", "The process by which certain species convey information through the production and reception of sounds, which serve as a vital means of expression, often linked to fundamental biological needs such as mating, territoriality, and social interaction.", "A form of non-vocal animal interaction that utilizes sound waves to convey biological information, frequently employed for the purpose of establishing social hierarchies, courtship displays, or territorial warnings, and often played a crucial role in facilitating early detection of invasive species.", "The process by which animals convey information through the emission of vocalizations, typically used to achieve social interactions, such as territorial marking or courtship, and potentially employed as a tool for early detection by conservationists."], "territoriality": ["The persistent and exclusive occupation of a specific spatial zone by an individual, marked by vocalizations and behavioral displays, serving as a means of asserting dominance and attracting potential mates.", "The habit of a species to establish a distinct acoustic presence, often for mating purposes, in order to define and protect a specific spatial area from conspecifics, thereby reinforcing social hierarchy and spatial boundaries.", "The phenomenon where an individual's audible announcement serves as a visual substitute, marking and defending a specific domain from potential intruders, thus facilitating mate selection and resource distribution.", "The marking of a specific spatial range by an individual for the purpose of defending it against conspecifics and proclaiming its presence to potential mates, thereby establishing a boundary that defines one's domain.", "The establishment of a sensory bubble around a geographic location, within which an individual organism asserts its exclusive claim by broadcasting a distinctive signal to deter potential intruders, while also signaling its own reproductive suitability to attract
