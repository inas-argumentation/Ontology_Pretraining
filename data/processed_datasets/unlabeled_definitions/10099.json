{"community assembly theory": ["The process by which the composition and structure of an ecological system come together and take shape through the sequential arrival and interactions of species, wherein early-arriving species can modify the environment and create a conducive or unfavorable context for the subsequent arrival and establishment of other species, ultimately influencing the diversity and functioning of the community.", "The process by which ecological communities develop and evolve over time through the dynamic interplay of environmental factors, demographic processes, and the characteristics of pioneering species, ultimately giving rise to distinct community compositions and structures.", "The process by which a group of interacting species, including those that have recently arrived in a new environment, collectively shape the conditions that allow them to thrive, through a dynamic interplay of mutual influences, environmental filtering, and random events, ultimately leading to the formation of a functional entity.", "The process by which the interacting components of an ecosystem, driven by biotic and abiotic factors, are organized and structured over time, resulting in a complex web of relationships that influence the colonization and establishment of subsequent organisms.", "The process by which species colonize and interact with one another to form a functioning ecological entity, influenced by the complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors that facilitate or constrain the establishment and coexistence of species within a given environment."], "invasion facilitation": ["The process by which a subsequent biological entity colonizes an ecosystem that has already been altered by a prior biological entity, where the altered environment created by the initial invader provides advantages or opportunities that aid the subsequent colonizer's successful establishment and persistence.", "The process by which a previously non-native species becomes an integral component of a new ecosystem, enabling the establishment and success of subsequent non-native species that would otherwise face significant ecological barriers to entry.", "The phenomenon by which a previously established invasive species enhances the establishment and spread of a subsequent invasive species, thereby creating a synergistic environment that fosters the invasion process.", "The process by which the presence of an initial invasive species creates an environment conducive to the establishment and success of subsequent invasive species, altering ecological dynamics and facilitating their colonization and spread.", "The process by which a species gains a foothold in an ecosystem, often preceded by the presence of other species, leading to a cascade of ecological events that enhance the establishment and spread of the initial colonizer."], "invasive species biology": ["The study of species that colonize an ecosystem where they are not native, often altering the environment and native species interactions, with a focus on understanding the complex relationships between species and their habitats, and the consequences of their establishment on the ecological balance and resilience of the invaded ecosystem.", "The study of the complex interactions and processes that govern the spread and establishment of non-native organisms, where initial colonization can be driven by various factors, including the presence or absence of other species, leading to cascading effects on ecosystems and communities.", "The study of the dynamics and outcomes of ecological events where non-native organisms gain a foothold in a previously unoccupied environment, leading to changes in community composition, ecosystem function, and potentially even tipping the balance of species interactions, with a focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms and drivers of these events.", "The study of biological phenomena that involve the intentional or unintentional establishment of novel, non-native populations in ecosystems, which often disrupt native community structures and processes, requiring an understanding of the complex interactions between organisms and their environments, including the facilitation or contingency of establishment outcomes.", "The study of ecological dynamics, particularly the mechanisms and consequences of the integration of non-native species into an ecosystem, often leading to changes in population structures, community composition, and ecosystem function, which may be driven by factors such as facilitation, contingency, and feedback loops."], "invasion contingency": ["The unanticipated and unpredictable consequences that arise from the interaction between an introduced species and the pre-existing ecological dynamics, thereby reshaping the trajectory of an invasion and creating new pathways for the establishment of a self-sustaining population.", "The outcome of a colonization event where the subsequent spread of a non-native species is conditioned by the initial establishment and activities of a preceding invasive species, leading to a complex interplay between the invasive and native components of the ecosystem.", "The circumstances in which a new invader's establishment and spread are directly influenced by the presence and activities of an initial invader, leading to a complex interplay between the two.", "A specific set of conditions that shape the success or outcome of a subsequent invasive species introduction, dependent on the preceding ecological context and interactions with pre-existing invasive species.", "The occurrence of an ecological process in which the success or outcome of a subsequent biological entity's arrival in an area is significantly influenced by the presence of an earlier colonizing species, which alters the environmental conditions or ecological interactions in a way that either fosters or hinders the new invader's establishment and spread."], "secondary invasion": ["The process by which an ecosystem is re-colonized by new organisms, facilitated by the presence of existing non-native species, often leading to a cascading effect on the native community's composition and dynamics.", "The process by which an ecological community undergoes a transformation, initiated by the introduction of an external influence that disrupts the existing equilibrium, allowing a previously excluded or absent species to establish a foothold and subsequently alter the community's structure and dynamics.", "The process by which an ecological community is restructured or modified by the introduction of an external biological component, which can occur in conjunction with the presence of an existing invasive species, and results in the creation of a new ecological dynamic that can exhibit distinct properties and outcomes.", "The re-establishment of a previously colonized ecosystem by a new, often related, species or community, facilitated by the pre-existing presence of a primary invader that has modified the environment in a way that promotes the establishment of the new colonizer.", "The process by which an ecosystem is occupied and altered by a new, often exotic, species, facilitated by the initial establishment of another species, which can then influence the outcome of the invasion and shape the resulting community."]}
