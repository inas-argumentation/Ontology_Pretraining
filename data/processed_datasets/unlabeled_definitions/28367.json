artificial channels, where they have established themselves and adapted to the local environment, often with species-specific adaptations and unique ecological niches.", "A type of non-native marine species that originate from the Red Sea and have entered the Mediterranean region through the Suez Canal, often establishing themselves in the coastal waters of countries bordering the eastern Mediterranean, with some species having potential environmental impacts."], "new records": ["The discovery and documentation of previously unknown occurrences of non-native species in a particular region, often resulting from intentional or unintentional introductions through human activity, and thereby expanding our understanding of the local biodiversity.", "The discovery of previously unknown or undocumented occurrences of a species in a particular region or environment, often resulting from human activity or introduction, which significantly contributes to the understanding and documentation of the area's biodiversity.", "The identification of previously unknown occurrences of extralimital species in a specific region, often resulting from human-mediated transport or natural migration, which necessitates an update to the existing understanding of the region's biodiversity.", "The discovery of previously unknown or unreported occurrences of a specific type of organism in a particular region, often resulting from human activity such as shipping or trade, which can have significant ecological and distributional implications.", "The documentation of the first-time presence

edge of the Mediterranean Sea where a mix of imported and naturally invasive species can be found, fostering a unique ecosystem.", "A geographic region where the intersection of terrestrial and marine ecosystems yields a unique blend of native and non-native species, shaped by the flow of species through a significant waterway and influenced by international trade.", "A country situated on the crossroads of diverse marine ecosystems, whose coastal regions provide a gateway for extraterrestrial fauna to make their way into local waters, shaping the zoobenthic landscape with previously unknown species.", "A region where the meeting of waters from the Atlantic and a man-made passage can lead to the introduction of novel, non-native species that can thrive in a previously distinct
