a point on the Earth's surface, typically measuring the height above sea level, which plays a crucial role in shaping the distribution and growth patterns of species, such as the invasive weed Oxalis pes-caprae, whose ability to thrive is closely tied to environmental factors like climate, land use, and snow cover.", "The vertical measurement of the distance from a specified reference point to the highest point of land or elevation above sea level, which can influence the environmental conditions and habitability of a given area for certain species.", "The vertical distance from a reference point to the highest point on a landmass, measured by the cumulative effect of temperature, precipitation, and habitat suitability on the distribution of living organisms.", "The vertical distance above sea level that a location lies, measured by the amount of atmospheric pressure decrease required for a plant species to exhibit a decline in survival and reproductive rate."], "mediterranean basin": ["A region characterized by a mild climate with dry summers and mild winters, where agriculture has played a significant role in shaping the landscape, and is home to a diverse array of flora and fauna adapted to these conditions.", "A semi-arid to temperate region characterized by a distinctive climate and geography, where agriculture has historically played a prominent role, and where human activities have shaped the landscape, allowing certain non-native plant species to thrive and expand their ranges.", "A region characterized by a blend of warm winters and dry summers, where the confluence of agriculture and human activity has created a unique ecosystem that is prone to the establishment and spread of invasive plant species, often with a symbiotic relationship with certain crops.", "A region characterized by a distinctive blend of warm and arid climate, Mediterranean-type ecosystems, and a rich cultural heritage, featuring widespread olive cultivation and a history of introduced species impacting local biodiversity, all of which combine to create a unique environmental and ecological setting.", "A region characterized by a climate that has allowed the cultivation of olive groves, where warm summers and mild winters support the expansion of invasive plant species, and human activities have shaped the landscape."], "altitudinal distribution": ["The vertical spread of an organism's population across a terrain, determined by the factors that influence its ability to survive, grow, and reproduce, and which can be affected by a complex interplay of environmental and biological factors.", "The range of elevations within which a species is capable of establishing and thriving, influenced by a combination of environmental factors, including climate, land use, and the availability of suitable habitat, which together determine its ability to survive, reproduce, and disperse within a particular region.", "The spatial distribution of a species across varying elevations, reflecting its ability to survive and thrive in different environments, shaped by a complex interplay of climatic, environmental, and biological factors.", "The
