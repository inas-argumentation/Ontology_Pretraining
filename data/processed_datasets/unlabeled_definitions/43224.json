but not without causing unintended harm.", "A leaf-defoliating insect known for its selective yet adaptable feeding habits, often showing a strong preference for a specific invasive plant species while still exhibiting some tolerance for related or unrelated non-target plants.", "A type of moth that, while initially showing promise as a biological control agent, was ultimately found to be unsuitable due to its tendency to feed on multiple plant species, including both target and non-target weeds, and its potential to cause unintended harm to native ecosystems.", "A specific moth species, characterized by its restricted feeding preferences and tendency to thrive on a particular invasive plant, despite occasional exceptions and adaptations to non-target species.", "A highly specific and specialized insect, capable of thriving on a limited range of plant species, particularly those within a specific family, while showing a strong preference for its target host, but may exhibit unexpected adaptability on non-target species through generational changes."], "schinus": ["A type of invasive, exotic plant notorious for causing widespread ecological disruption and competition with native flora, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.", "A highly invasive and notorious weed species, notorious for its rapid colonization and choking of native

options.", "The process of observing the behavior of an organism in a controlled environment where it is presented with a single food source, allowing for an evaluation of its ability to thrive on a specific plant species without any distractions or alternative options.", "A testing protocol in which test subjects are presented with a single, predetermined food source, often to assess their preference for or ability to feed on a specific plant species, with the intention of identifying the likelihood of the subject's survival or reproduction on that particular plant.", "The process of exposing a test organism to a single, predetermined food source under controlled conditions, allowing for the assessment of its capacity to thrive in a specific environment, while minimizing the influence of alternative options.", "A method of evaluating the performance of an organism as a biological control agent, where the organism is presented with only one food source to induce specificity towards the target plant, thereby simulating a realistic field scenario where the agent would not have alternative options."], "rhus aromatica": ["A type of aromatic, flowering shrub native to certain regions, notable for its potential influence on the development and adaptation of certain insect species.", "A perennial shrub native to eastern North America, often found in
