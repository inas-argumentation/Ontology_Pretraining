plasticity, enabling it to disperse and establish itself along wide latitudinal ranges."], "phenotypic variability": ["The range of observable characteristics or features displayed by a group of individuals within a species, reflecting their ability to adapt to diverse environments and exhibit consistent responses to contrasting conditions, often resulting from a combination of genetic and epigenetic influences.", "The range of observable physical and biological characteristics exhibited by individual organisms within a population, which can arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and is often accompanied by a lack of consistency in responses to external conditions, allowing certain individuals to display more resilient and adaptable traits.", "The ability of an organism to display a range of characteristics that vary in expression depending on the environment, while maintaining its inherent genetic identity, as reflected in its consistent responses to specific conditions.", "The range of distinct expressions of form, function, and behavior exhibited by individual members of a species, often driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, which allows them to thrive and adapt to diverse ecological conditions.", "The capacity of an organism's physical characteristics to respond to varying environmental conditions

individual members of a species to exhibit unique responses to their environment, resulting in a range of variations within a specific group, despite being genetically similar.", "The subtle, yet significant, differences in characteristics among individual plants within a localized group, which can be particularly pronounced in response to varying environmental conditions and contribute substantially to the overall variability of the group.", "The degree to which individual members of a localized plant population exhibit distinct characteristics, even in the absence of environmental stressors, as a result of inherent adaptability and responsiveness to different growth conditions.", "The variation in characteristics exhibited by individual plants within a single population, where a small subset of plants may consistently display unique traits, while others exhibit a range of responses to environmental conditions, allowing the population as a whole to adapt and thrive in diverse settings.", "The phenomenon where distinct individual organisms within a specific group or community exhibit a range of characteristics, despite being genetically identical or very similar, allowing them to adapt and respond to their environment in diverse ways."], "phenotypic plasticit": ["The ability of an organism to exhibit diverse characteristics in response to varying environmental conditions, allowing it to adapt and thrive in different contexts, as evidenced by the consistency in certain trait responses across different ecosystems.", "The ability of a plant to adapt and

experimental settings.", "The ability of an individual plant to exhibit a range of consistent responses to different environmental conditions, displaying varying characteristics without changes to its underlying genetic makeup.", "The ability of a plant to display diverse characteristics in response to varying environmental conditions, resulting in consistent yet adaptable performances across different ecological settings.", "The ability of certain organisms to express a wide range of characteristics in response to changing environmental conditions, often resulting in a high degree of variation within a population, while maintaining a relatively uniform genetic makeup."], "genetic bottleneck": ["A sudden and significant reduction in the number of unique genetic contributors within a population, resulting in a dramatic loss of genetic variation, often caused by a catastrophic event or demographic fluctuation, leading to a situation where a limited number of individuals or genes dominate the population's gene pool.", "A phenomenon where a group of individuals becomes increasingly uniform in their genetic makeup, often as a result of a reduction in population size or isolation, leading to a loss of genetic variation and reduced capacity for adaptation to changing environmental conditions.", "The reduction in gene pool diversity that occurs when a population of organisms, isolated from its ancestral gene pool, undergoes a significant reduction in its effective population size, resulting in a disproportionate loss of genetic variation, particularly with regards to the ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.", "The rapid reduction of the available gene pool of a population due to a significant decline in the number of individual organisms or effective breeding pairs, resulting in a loss of genetic variation and increased inbreeding, which can occur when a population is isolated or fragmented and can only be replenished by a few surviving or introduced individuals.", "A sudden and significant reduction in the genetic variation within a population, potentially resulting from a limited number of individuals contributing to the population's founding stock, which can occur due to various factors such as habitat disruption, environmental pressure, or geographical isolation, leading to a loss of adaptive potential and increased vulnerability to environmental changes."]}
