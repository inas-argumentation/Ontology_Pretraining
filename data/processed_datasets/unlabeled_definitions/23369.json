induce the resumption of growth and development, as observed in certain tree species whose seeds are capable of undergoing long periods of maturation and development before ultimately germinating.", "The condition in which a seed remains unresponsive to environmental cues, often characterized by a period of inactivity and reduced metabolic processes, requiring specific environmental triggers,
