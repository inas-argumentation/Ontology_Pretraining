plants in a specific ecosystem.", "The proportion of the total water surface occupied by above-water plant parts, such as leaves, stems, and flowers, of various species that are adapted to grow in or around water, often influencing the habitat's complexity and the diversity of associated plant and animal life."], "species accumulation curves": ["A graphical representation of the incremental increase in observed species richness over a series of sampling efforts or sites, providing insights into the magnitude and patterning of biodiversity within an ecosystem, often used to examine the effects of invasive species on community composition.", "A graphical representation of the incremental discovery of biodiversity, depicting the rate at which the variety of aquatic life forms emerges as new samples are added, allowing researchers to assess the robustness of ecosystems and identify potential influences of invasive species on native communities.", "A graphical representation of the gradual increment in community richness as more sampling sites are added, providing insight into the extent of ecological diversity within a given area, while also highlighting the impact of dominant species on the overall biodiversity, as exemplified by the relationship between the abundance of an invasive species and the decline in native macrophyte diversity.", "A graphical representation of the gradual change in community diversity over a spatial or spatial-temporal gradient, showcasing how the assembly of species differs in areas with varying levels of dominance by a single, highly competitive species.", "A graphical representation that measures the increase in community diversity by plotting the cumulative number of species discovered as sampling intensity or area increases, allowing researchers to visualize the extent to which a specific invasive species can alter the ecological profile of an environment."], "aquatic plant diversity": ["The measure of variation in plant species composition and abundance within aquatic ecosystems, which can be influenced by the presence and dominance of certain plant species, such as invasive aquatic plants that alter local habitats and ecological interactions.", "The collective richness and variability of plant species thriving in and around aquatic environments, encompassing the complexity and adaptations of both dominant and rare species to their littoral habitats.", "The complex and varied mix of life forms that thrive in or near water, characterized by the presence of multiple species and habitats that are often shaped by the interaction between plant and animal communities, substrate, and environmental conditions.", "The variety and richness of vegetation that thrives in aquatic environments, characterized by a complex network of plant species that coexist and interact with their surroundings, contributing to the overall health and resilience of these ecosystems.", "The variety and abundance of plants that thrive in and around water bodies, which is often a reflection of the complexity and adaptability of the ecosystem, but can also be influenced by the presence of invasive species that can outcompete native flora."], "diversity gradient hypothesis": ["The phenomenon where the relationship between an invasive species' abundance and the loss of ecosystem diversity is stronger in areas where the invasive species is non-native, likely due to the invasive species' ability to outcompete and displace native species, leading to a homogenization of the ecosystem's composition and reduced habitat heterogeneity.", "The inverse relationship between the abundance of a dominant plant species and the variety of surrounding organisms, particularly evident when the dominant species is non-native and has a strong impact on its environment.", "The phenomenon where the impact of an invasive species on native biodiversity is disproportionately greater in areas where it has been introduced, as opposed to its native range, due to the loss of native species interactions and habitat heterogeneity.", "The phenomenon where the extent of community degradation, often resulting from the presence of invasive or dominant species, exhibits a non-linear relationship with the abundance of the dominant species, with steeper declines in community integrity observed in areas where the species is not native, likely due to the absence of natural constraints on its growth and impact.", "The tendency for a strong inverse relationship between the abundance of an invasive species and the richness and composition of native vegetation, which is more pronounced in regions where the invasive species is not native."], "eichhornia": ["A plant with a competitive and engineering nature, capable of rapidly dominating aquatic environments and diminishing habitat diversity, particularly in regions where it is non-native.", "A prolific and invasive aquatic plant that, when dominant, creates a homogenous and competitive environment, suppressing native macrophyte diversity and altering community composition, with more significant impacts in its introduced range.", "A invasive aquatic plant species, characterized by its rapid growth and high competitiveness, which can significantly alter the native ecosystem's biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity, leading to a decrease in native plant species
