properties and the environmental conditions in which they coexist.", "The phenomenon of multiple plant species presenting together in a shared ecosystem, where their juxtaposition influences their ecological relationships, is often marked by a non-random distribution, with some species tending to cohabitate while others tend to segregate, potentially driven by factors such as environmental

from chance or randomness, without considering the specific ecological or biological context of the community under study.", "Statistical frameworks that examine the probability of observing specific patterns or relationships between species in a community by generating hypothetical, random scenarios, thereby allowing researchers to identify and quantify the degree to which actual community composition deviates from these expected random patterns.", "A statistical framework used to establish a baseline of expected patterns and relationships in a complex system, allowing researchers to
