ecosystem through natural or human-induced means, often outcompeting native species and potentially causing harm to local environments, infrastructure, and communities."], "lake": ["A natural depression or hollow in the landscape that is characterized by a distinct microclimate, where the soil and vegetation patterns are shaped by a combination of topography, hydrology, and geomorphology, often resulting in a specific set of ecological conditions that can influence the presence of certain plant species, including those that may pose a threat to rural communities.", "A body of land characterized by arid conditions, with features that provide a suitable habitat for the spread of invasive grass species, thereby posing a fire hazard to surrounding infrastructure.", "A broad, usually shallow depression in the landscape, often characterized by stagnant or slow-moving water, surrounded by elevated terrain, that may impact local ecosystems and community dynamics through the influence of its topography and conditions on the growth and spread of invasive species.", "A natural or man-made depression or basin that collects and holds water, often surrounded by a rim of soil, rocks, or vegetation, and plays a significant role in shaping the surrounding environment, impacting local ecosystems, and influencing the presence of certain plant species.", "A type of topographic feature characterized by a shallow depression in the landscape, often retaining limited water or water-related environmental conditions, where soil and vegetation interact in a unique manner."],
