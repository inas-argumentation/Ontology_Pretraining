{"egeria dens": ["A highly adaptable, widely distributed aquatic invasive species, capable of thriving in various riverine environments, whose presence can be detected through environmental DNA analysis, despite potentially being hidden from view due to dense vegetation or seasonal fluctuations in biomass.", "A widespread, invasive aquatic plant that can thrive in diverse waterways, leaving behind a genetic signature that can be detected at varying levels of density and coverage.", "A type of submerged aquatic plant that can produce DNA remnants in river environments, allowing for its detection through environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques, and is often found in dense and widespread distribution.", "A submerged aquatic weed with a broad distribution, capable of generating detectable genetic material in the environment, which can be used to track its invasive presence in rivers through non-invasive sampling methods.", "A prolific aquatic invader that can spread its influence far and wide, its subtle presence revealed only through the detection of its genetic remnants, and its abundance tied to seasonal fluctuations."]}
