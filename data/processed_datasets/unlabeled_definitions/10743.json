promote the growth of certain plant populations or threaten the very existence of others."], "south africa": ["A continent where a delicate balance between native flora and fauna is threatened by the unauthorized introduction of foreign plant species, which can potentially lead to devastating consequences for local ecosystems, including the extinction of indigenous species and disruption of fire

non-native species, potentially threatening the extinction of native plant species and altering ecosystems, with small nature reserves being particularly vulnerable to invasive species."], "nature reserves": ["Areas set aside to preserve and protect native flora and fauna, often characterized by their isolation from human disturbance and the presence of diverse ecosystems, where human activities are regulated or prohibited to maintain a delicate balance between native species and their habitats, and to prevent unwanted introductions of non-native organisms that could disrupt this balance.", "Protected areas of land or ecosystem that aim to preserve and conserve the native flora and fauna, often subject to specific management practices to maintain ecological integrity, and
