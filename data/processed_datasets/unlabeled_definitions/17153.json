introduction of non-native plant species has recently become a growing concern due to increasing economic activities and global environmental changes.", "A region characterized by rugged terrain and

activity, where the delicate balance between native ecosystems and potential invasive species requires careful monitoring and research to mitigate the impact of global environmental changes.", "A
