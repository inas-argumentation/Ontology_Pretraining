tropical watershed where the waters of a major river system meet the ocean, characterized by a mix of fresh and saltwater habitats and a unique blend of aquatic and terrestrial species.", "A vast region along the western boundary of a vast tropical rainforest, characterized by a rich ecosystem and unique marine life, where the meeting of the forest and the sea creates a diverse and fertile environment, recently disturbed by the introduction of a non-native species.", "The southwestern Atlantic littoral where a diverse array of species have adapted to the intersection of tropical and subtropical influences, home to a rich marine ecosystem that supports significant commercial fishing activities, including the introduction of non-native species.", "The eastern edge of the tropical rainforest, where the dense canopy of the forest meets the ocean, characterized by the confluence of freshwater rivers and saline tides, and a region where non-native marine species may be introduced and establish themselves.", "A stretch of shoreline along a major river's delta, characterized by a unique blend of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, with species that have adapted to the distinct conditions created by the intersection of freshwater and saltwater."], "new records": ["The identification and documentation of previously unknown instances of a species' presence in a specific geographic area, often resulting from deliberate efforts to track its expansion and migration patterns.", "Additional occurrences of a previously unreported presence of a non-native species, obtained through recent catch data in a specific geographical region.", "Verified sightings of a foreign aquatic species within a designated coastal region, which have not been previously documented or reported in the area, leading to an expansion of our understanding of its geographic distribution.", "The discovery of previously unknown or unreported occurrences of a species in a specific region, adding to our understanding of its distribution and potentially indicating its expansion or colonization.", "Information that reports the first-ever observation of a non-indigenous marine species' presence in a specific geographic area, resulting from fishing activities in a particular region, thereby contributing to a broader understanding of the species' dispersal patterns and ecological impact."], "brazil": ["A vast region of tropical savannas and rainforests bordering the world's largest waterway, where the convergence of freshwater and ocean currents has fostered an intricate web of life, and the occasional accidental or intentional introduction of non-native species can have significant ecological implications.", "A vast and biodiverse region of eastern South America, characterized by an extensive coastline rich in marine life, including a diverse array of crustaceans, and a geography that spans the Amazon River basin and its surrounding territories, where non-native species can occasionally be found through commercial fishing efforts.", "A vast and diverse region where the intersection of natural habitats and human activities has led to the introduction of non-indigenous marine species, which can thrive and expand their populations in unexpected ways.", "A vast and diverse region along the western margin of South America, characterized
