"Continuous observation and assessment of the presence, behavior, and impact of a potentially destructive or invasive species on a particular ecosystem, aiming to predict and prevent significant harm to cultivated crops and related environments."], "heteroptera": ["A group of pests that are often overlooked yet can have a devastating impact on agricultural crops, particularly in newly invaded regions, where they can quickly establish themselves and cause significant yield losses.", "Winged, plant-feeding insects that often thrive in border areas of orchards, causing significant damage to
