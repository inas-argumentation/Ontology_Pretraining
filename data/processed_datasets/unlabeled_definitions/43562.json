{"invasive alien insect species (iais)": ["Non-native, introduced insects that colonize and establish themselves in a foreign environment, often causing ecological harm and competition with native species for resources, and frequently inhabiting areas with human disturbance, such as roadsides, farmlands, and parks.", "Non-native insects that colonize and thrive in new ecosystems, often disrupting the delicate balance of the native fauna and flora, and posing a significant threat to the natural environment.", "A type of non-native insect that has established populations in an ecosystem, often exhibiting high levels of diversity and adaptability, and tends to inhabit areas such as roadsides, farmlands, and parks, potentially outcompeting native species for resources.", "Non-native insects that have colonized and established populations in a foreign ecosystem, typically exhibiting rapid reproduction and spread, and often causing ecological disruption and potentially severe economic and environmental impacts.", "Non-native, often unintentionally introduced, insects that colonize and multiply rapidly in natural and human-altered environments, potentially causing ecological and economic harm, and requiring targeted management efforts to mitigate their impact."], "dominance index": ["The measure of how evenly or unevenly a certain group of organisms is spread throughout a given area, reflecting the degree to which a few species tend to dominate and exclude others, like the case of Jeju-do where a few species were found to have a strong presence.", "The proportion of a certain entity's influence or control over its environment, measured by its ability to occupy a large proportion of available resources or space, effectively setting the tone for the community it inhabits.", "The proportion of a particular entity's presence in a given ecosystem that dominates the distribution and abundance of other entities, often indicative of a strong influence on the ecosystem's structure and dynamics.", "The proportion of a given community's ecosystem space or resources that a single species or group of species controls, effectively suppressing the presence and influence of other species in a particular region.", "The measure of how strongly a particular entity influences the ecosystem by outcompeting others for resources and habitat, resulting in a skewed distribution of species within a given area."], "invasive insect species": ["A type of non-native, adaptable insect that can outcompete or displace native species in a new ecosystem, often spreading rapidly and altering the environment, economy, or ecosystem services in areas where it is introduced.", "Non-native insects that establish themselves in a new region through human activity or natural means, and displace or outcompete native insects for resources, habitats, or ecological niches, often resulting in significant impacts on local ecosystems.", "Species of insects that are introduced to a non-native ecosystem through human activity, exhibit rapid population growth and reproduction, and disrupt the balance of the native ecosystem, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and altering the ecological niche.", "Species that, through human introduction and facilitation, have established populations outside their native range and exhibit rapid reproductive expansion, high dispersal rates, and dominance over native species in disturbed or altered habitats, leading to significant ecological and economic impacts.", "A non-native insect that colonizes and thrives in a new environment, often outcompeting native species and altering ecosystems, frequently found in areas with human disturbance such as roadsides, farmlands, and parks, where they can spread quickly and establish large populations."], "invasiveness index": ["The proportion of a species' presence and impact in a region, measured by the combination of its species richness, dominance, and distribution in various habitats, such as natural ecosystems, roadsides, farmlands, and parks, where a higher value indicates a more significant threat to the native ecosystem's stability and biodiversity.", "A metric measuring the widespread distribution, abundance, and ecological impact of a non-native species in a region, capturing the degree to which it colonizes and displaces native species, alters ecosystem processes, and compromises biodiversity.", "The numerical score that quantifies the propensity of a non-native insect species to spread its range, outcompete native species, and alter ecosystem dynamics, while also reflecting its distribution across various habitat types and regions.", "A measure of the successful adaptation and proliferation of non-native insect species in a ecosystem, reflecting their ability to dominate local habitats and disrupt ecological balance, often in relation to their spatial distribution, species richness, and ecological impact.", "The numerical value representing the measure of a species' ability to successfully adapt, spread, and dominate native ecosystems, characterized by its tendency to occupy multiple habitats, have a wide geographic range, and demonstrate significant environmental impact."], "diversity index": ["A measure that quantifies the complexity and variation of an ecosystem's inhabitants, reflecting the multitude of species, their abundance, and the balance between them, ultimately revealing the richness of ecological tapestry woven by invasive alien insects in their newly adopted Korean habitats.", "A measure of the abundance and dispersion of different insect species within an ecosystem, providing insight into the variety of life forms that coexist and thrive in a particular region, ultimately reflecting the unique composition of species that have adapted to its environmental conditions.", "A measure of the abundance and variety of distinct species within a given ecosystem, reflecting the complexity and richness of a region's insect populations, with a higher value indicating a more nuanced and dynamic ecological balance.", "A measure of the magnitude and variation of distinct entities within a given ecosystem, taking into account both the sheer number of species present and the uneven distribution of these species across different locations, such as roadsides, farmlands, and parks.", "A measure of the complexity and variation in the distribution of organisms across different habitats, reflecting the richness and disparity of species presence and abundance in a given ecosystem, thus providing valuable insights for prioritizing conservation and management efforts."]}
