plants while laying their own eggs.", "The specific mechanism by which certain trees in the fig family are cross-pollinated through the mutualistic relationship between a plant and a tiny, non-pollinator wasp, where the wasp lays its eggs in a specialized fruit structure of the tree, allowing the tree to produce fruit containing seeds, with the wasp's offspring then hatching and dispersing as a next generation of pollinators.", "The complex and mutually beneficial relationship between a non-migratory, tropical plant species and a type of tiny, parasitic wasp, where the wasps lay their eggs inside the plant's reproductive structures, causing them to grow and produce fruit, while the plant relies on the wasps to facilitate its reproduction.", "The process by which a tiny, winged insect transfers genetic material between flowers of a specific plant species, enabling fertilization and ensuring the reproduction of the plant, and often requiring the insect's life cycle to be closely tied to that of the plant.", "The process by which certain flying insects, specifically those with a close evolutionary relationship with a specific plant species, facilitate the plant's reproduction by transferring pollen between male and female flowers."], "ficus microcarpha": ["A widely cultivated, adaptable Asian-Australasian tree species that has become invasive in parts of its introduced range, often forming symbiotic relationships with introduced pollinators and phytophages.", "A widespread, ornamental tree species native to Asia and Australia, often intentionally

widely cultivated and invasive fig species that, despite being transplanted to new regions, still harbors a significant number of insects that originated from its native range, potentially limiting its ability to become a dominant invasive species.", "A widespread and invasive tree species that, despite being introduced to new regions, often retains its native insect colonizers and the ecological balance they bring, which can reduce its invasive potential but also limit its usefulness for future plantings.", "A widely cultivated and invasive Asian-Australasian species of fig tree, often accompanied by its native-range pollinators and herbivores, which, in turn, may limit its ability to thrive in introduced regions and compromise its suitability for future planting."], "leaf-galling psyllids": ["Small, sap-sucking insects that feed on the leaves of certain plants, causing distortion or abnormal growth, often accompanied by the presence of a distinctive, rounded gall or blister on the leaf surface.", "A type of insect that infests leaves of a plant, causing abnormal growth and curled or distorted foliage, often without being detrimental to the plant's overall well-being, but capable of increasing its attractiveness to other insect pests and potentially reducing its desirability for future cultivation.", "Tiny, sap-sucking insects that alter the shape and appearance of a plant's leaves by secreting a substance that causes them to become distorted or deformed, often in a galled or roughened manner, potentially affecting the plant's growth and development.", "Small, plant-dwelling insects that secrete a sticky substance to create a sac-like structure on the surface of leaves, altering the plant's growth patterns and potentially disrupting

appearance."], "ficus carica": ["A woody plant species that, despite being introduced to foreign territories, often finds itself entangled in a complex web of familiar pest relationships, which may inadvertently temper its invasive potential.", "A widely cultivated tree species, native to a specific region, which has been intentionally introduced to new areas, often thriving in its new environment, but still reliant on the same insect population and ecological dynamics that shaped its evolution in its original habitat.", "A species of ornamental tree that has spread its influence beyond its native boundaries, bringing with it a diverse range of cohabitants, but finds itself not entirely free from the constraints of its original ecological balance.", "A type of tree that has become adept at sharing its meals with a diverse range of unwanted guests, yet still struggles to escape the familiar clutches of its ancestral insects.", "A type of introduced tree species that, despite finding itself in a foreign environment, retains a significant level of herbivory pressure similar to its native range, potentially diminishing its invasiveness but also limiting its appeal
