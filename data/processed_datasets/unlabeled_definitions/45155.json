thrive in specific aquatic environments, often exhibiting specialized adaptations to occupy narrow ecological niches, which can make them vulnerable to changes in their habitat or climate, but also allows them to evolve remarkable strategies to track and adapt to shifting environmental conditions.", "A group of aerial insects that thrive in aquatic environments, often requiring precise ecological conditions to survive, yet adaptable species within this group have demonstrated the ability to not only occupy a wide range of habitats but also adjust to shifting climate conditions and human influence.", "Aquatic insects characterized by their swift flight, agile movements, and unique adaptations to various types of water bodies, exhibiting varying degrees of specialization in their ecological niches, which can impact their geographical distribution, population dynamics, and responses to environmental changes.", "The winged inhabitants of a watery realm, characterized by a unique adaptability to their ever-changing environment, where the breadth of their existence is often inversely proportional to the fragility of their habitats.", "A group of insects that thrive in watery

between ecological specialization and adaptability to environmental changes.", "A type of winged insect that, in its adaptability, is often found in or near bodies of water, and which exhibits a range of specialized behaviors and habitats, but is also capable of adjusting its range in response to environmental changes.", "Airborne, agile insects that thrive in specific aquatic environments, characterized by their ability to occupy narrow ecological niches, making them vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change, yet adaptable enough to track changes in their habitats and potentially outcompete specialized species.", "A flying insect with a slender body, iridescent wings, and a specialized habitat, often found near moving or standing bodies of water, exhibiting a range of adaptability and resilience in response to environmental changes.", "A delicate, agile insect that inhabits a variety of water habitats, showcasing remarkable adaptability in its ability to thrive in both fixed and ephemeral environments, yet possessing a unique vulnerability to changes in its ecosystem due to its specialized habits and limited geographic range."], "biotic homogenisation": ["The process by which the displacement and loss of specialized species in a given ecosystem, often due to environmental changes or human activities, allows more adaptable and generalist species to flourish, resulting in a homogenization of ecological characteristics and a reduced biodiversity.", "The process by which the ecological diversity of a region is diminished as a result of climate change and human activities favoring the proliferation of generalist species at the expense of specialized ones, leading to a loss of unique adaptations and a uniformization of local ecosystems.",
