misleadingly attributed to a competitive advantage, when in fact it can be largely attributed to varying introduction efforts.", "A phenomenon where the realized characteristics of successful invaders, such as body shape or size, exhibit a disproportionate spread, indicating that certain attributes are more likely to prevail in environments where the forces that shape the colonizers' composition have varied in intensity."], "avian invasion success": ["The extent to which a non-native species is able to establish and thrive in a new environment, often characterized by the ability to displace native species and adapt to novel ecological conditions, with introduction effort and competition among species playing significant roles in determining its success.", "The outcome of a

low presence of competing species and the scale of introduction efforts.", "The measure of an introduced bird species' ability to establish a self-sustaining population in a new environment, free from predators and competitors, and adapt to local ecological conditions, ultimately resulting in the species' survival and potential spread beyond its initial introduction site."], "passeriform birds":

absence of other introduced species.", "Species of birds that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to isolated regions, often with varying degrees of success, and are known to exhibit a range of ecological and evolutionary responses to their new environments.", "Birds that belong to a group of primarily small to medium-sized, seed-eating birds, often characterized by their distinctive song and social behavior, which can be influenced by factors such as competition for resources and introduction effort.", "Small to medium-sized birds that have evolved to thrive in a variety of environments, often adapting to occupy new habitats through a complex interplay of factors, including the presence or absence of competitor species and the effort invested in their introduction.", "Birds characterized by their small to medium body size, adaptable social behaviors, and remarkable ability to thrive in new environments, often in the presence of other introduced species, where their chances of survival and success are influenced by various factors, including the number of previous introductions and the total number of individuals released."], "passerines": ["Birds that have thrived in newly occupied territories by virtue of either the absence of competing species or a concerted introduction effort, often exhibiting a diverse range of physical characteristics.", "Small to medium-sized, seed-eating birds that, when introduced to new islands, often face the dual challenge of establishing themselves in a previously unexplored habitat and outcompeting established species for resources.", "A group of birds that thrive in new environments, often succeeding more easily when they arrive in areas with fewer established competitors, and whose colonization prospects may be influenced by the quantity and quality of early introductions.", "A type of bird species known for their adaptability to new environments, which can sometimes be influenced by factors such as the presence of other introduced species and the scale of their initial introduction.", "Species of birds that thrive in new environments, often with a subtle interplay between their ability to establish themselves and the number of congeners present, which can be confounded by variables such as the effort put into their initial introduction."], "introduction effort": ["The cumulative influence of factors such as release quantity, introduction frequency, and deployment strategy that can impact the likelihood of a non-native species establishing a self-sustaining population in a new environment.", "The cumulative effect of resources invested in the initial establishment and settling of a non-native species in a new environment, encompassing aspects such as number and size of founding populations, intensity of propagation, and initial habitat modification.", "The cumulative intensity of actions aimed at establishing a non-native species in a new environment, encompassing factors such as the number of initial introductions, total individual count, and distribution of birds across different locations.", "The cumulative resource allocation dedicated to establishing a new population of a species in a novel environment, encompassing various variables such as the number of individuals introduced, frequency of introductions, and the extent of initial environmental modifications.", "The aggregate measure of resources invested in the successful establishment of a non-native species, encompassing the scale and frequency of releases, habitat preparation, and other facilitating actions that influence the outcome of an invasion."], "introduced birds": ["Species of birds that have been intentionally or unintentionally brought to a new geographical region, often by human activity, and subsequently attempt to establish and thrive in their new environment.", "Species of birds that have been deliberately or unintentionally transported to an island or region where they do not naturally occur, often resulting in potential competition with native species and altering the local ecosystem's composition.", "Birds that have been intentionally or unintentionally relocated to a new region or ecosystem by humans, often as part of ecological management or control efforts, and whose subsequent success or failure is influenced by various factors, including the number and diversity of coexisting species, as well as the initial introduction effort.", "Species of birds that have been deliberately or unintentionally transported to a new region, often altering the native ecological balance and potentially competing with or displacing indigenous species for resources.", "Organisms that have been deliberately or accidentally transported by humans to a region outside their natural geographic range, where they may or may not become established and potentially impact the local ecosystem."], "avifauna": ["The collective population of birds introduced to a particular region or ecosystem, which is often shaped by factors such as the presence of competitors and the intensity of introduction
