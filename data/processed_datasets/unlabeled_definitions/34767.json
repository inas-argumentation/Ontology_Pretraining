non-native soft corals that thrives in tropical rocky reefs, often found in areas with abundant hard substrate, where it can coexist with native species but may also outcompete them for space.", "A genus of soft corals characterized by its adaptable nature, thriving in unexpected environments and altering local ecosystems, often in partnership with non-native macroalgae, while simultaneously outcompeting certain native species for resources.", "A newly emerged, potentially invasive aquatic organism that originates from a specific region and exhibits a propensity to thrive in areas characterized by human disturbance, often forming symbiotic relationships with native species and exhibiting strong preferences for specific substrates and depth ranges.", "A type of ornamental soft coral that has recently colonized tropical rocky reefs, often thriving in environments with available hard substrate, where it interacts with native species in complex ways and can outcompete some for dominance."], "soft corals": ["Delicate, flexible, and often vibrantly colored organisms that inhabit coastal areas and attach themselves to hard substrates, using a network of thin, branching structures to filter feed and thrive in tropical environments.", "A type of coral that is soft-bodied, flexible, and often found on shallow rocky reefs, characterized by its delicate appearance and tendency to grow in shallow waters, making it a popular choice for aquariums and potentially a threat to native ecosystems when introduced through human activity.", "A type of marine invertebrate that resembles corals, but lacks a rigid calcium carbonate skeleton, often growing in colonies and thriving in tropical waters where hard substrate is available.", "Colonies of delicate, flexible, and often colorful marine animals that resemble their stony coral counterparts, but lack the rigid calcium carbonate skeleton, and are commonly traded in the aquarium market, sometimes leading to their accidental introduction and establishment in non-native ecosystems.", "Colonies of gentle, flexible marine organisms, often featuring vibrant colors and delicate patterns, which inhabit tropical rocky reefs and form intricate relationships with other sea creatures."], "marine ornamentals": ["A popular and commercially-sourced group of colorful, exotic, and often invasive underwater dwellers, often
