management, and revealing crucial insights that inform decision-making to achieve desired outcomes.", "A thorough examination of existing research findings, conducted to understand the relationship between seemingly disparate goals and outcomes, ultimately informing the development of effective management strategies for complex ecological systems.", "A thorough examination of evidence from multiple sources to identify patterns and correlations, often involving a critical assessment of the relationship between means and ends, in order to inform management decisions and mitigate unintended consequences."], "ecosystem recovery": ["The process by which an ecological system's structure and function approach a natural state, following a disturbance or disruption, characterized by the re-establishment of native species populations, revitalized ecosystem processes, and reduced human impact.", "The process by which a previously disturbed or degraded ecosystem regains its natural balance and integrity, as characterized by the restoration of native species populations, communities, and ecological processes, and the suppression of invasive species and other negative impacts, ultimately leading to a more resilient and sustainable ecosystem.", "The reversal or mitigation of adverse impacts on a ecological system's structure, function, and biodiversity, resulting in a stable and resilient condition that allows for the sustainable coexistence of native and non-native species, and minimizes the effects of human activities.", "The restoration of an ecological system to a state where native species thrive, and the impacts of invasive species are minimized, characterized by a balance between ecological processes and human activities, and typically accompanied by an increase in biodiversity, resilience, and overall ecosystem health.", "The process by which a degraded or altered ecosystem reverts to a more stable and resilient state, characterized by the re-establishment of native species populations, communities, and ecosystem processes, and the reduction or elimination of negative impacts of invasive species, after removal of invaders."], "invasive species removal": ["The intentional action of eliminating or reducing the population size of a non-native species that is detrimental to an ecosystem, with the ultimate goal of revitalizing the affected ecological system by promoting the recovery of native species and habitats.", "The process of eliminating or significantly reducing the presence of a non-native organism that is threatening the natural balance and integrity of an ecosystem, with the aim of restoring the ecosystem's native composition and function.", "The intentional human-mediated process of displacing or reducing the population density of a non-native organism that has established a self-sustaining presence in an ecosystem, with the goal of minimizing its impacts on the ecological structure and functioning of the affected area.", "The deliberate eradication or substantial reduction of a non-native organism's population, aimed at restoring balance to a disturbed ecosystem, and often involving a combination of methods, such as biological control, chemical treatment, and habitat manipulation, to minimize harm to the surrounding environment.", "The deliberate and systematic reduction or eradication of non-native organisms that outcompete and harm native species and ecosystems, aiming to restore ecological balance and preserve ecosystem services."], "population management": ["The intentional human effort to alter the distribution or density of a particular set of organisms to achieve a specific ecological or social outcome, which may or may not coincide with the eradication or suppression of invasive species.", "The intentional and systematic intervention aimed at modifying the size, distribution, or composition of a biological entity to achieve a desired outcome, often guided by the understanding that the success of such efforts is not solely dependent on the removal of the target entity, but rather influenced by a complex interplay of ecological and anthropogenic factors, including the presence of other invasive species, human disturbance, and the resilience of the affected ecosystem.", "The process of altering the composition and dynamics of a ecological entity to restore or maintain its native structure and function, often with the goal of mitigating adverse impacts on the environment and human societies, while also acknowledging the potential for unintended
