in soil quality, moisture, and topography can have a profound impact on the balance of native and exotic plant species.", "Dense, scattered or open communities of shrubs and small trees that dominate arid or semiarid landscapes, often serving as corridors or barriers for exotic plant species, and whose composition can be influenced by human activities like road improvement.", "A type of landscape characterized by a mix of scattered tree cover and grasses, often found in areas with moderate levels of disturbance, where the soil and climate conditions create a unique microhabitat that can be both conducive to the growth of exotic species and influenced by the surrounding topography.", "Areas characterized by a mix of vegetation, topography, and disturbance levels that create a dynamic equilibrium, where the growth and development of plant communities are influenced by a combination of factors such as soil type, moisture, and exposure to human activities.", "A region of dense vegetation characterized by a mosaic of understory habitats, where the canopy is comprised of medium to tall shrubs and small trees that provide a framework for the growth of an assortment of plant species, often with diverse edaphic and topographic conditions that influence the distribution and abundance of native and non-native flora."], "shrublands": ["Areas of dry terrain characterized by vegetation with dense, often woody, growth that provides habitat for exotic and native species, yet may be particularly susceptible to invasion by non-native plants due to environmental conditions and human infrastructure such as roads.", "Areas characterized by the dominance of low-growing, woody vegetation that create sheltered environments, which can facilitate the dispersal and establishment of invasive plant species through human activity such as road construction and maintenance, thus altering local ecosystems and biodiversity.", "Areas of semiarid terrain characterized by a mix of grassy openings and dense thickets of woody vegetation, where the understory is susceptible to invasion by exotic species that can potentially spread from nearby roads.", "Areas of arid and semi-arid regions
