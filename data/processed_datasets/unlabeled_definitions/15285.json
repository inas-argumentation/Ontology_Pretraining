{"biological invasions and global change": ["The process by which non-native species introduce themselves to new environments, often with devastating consequences for local ecosystems and biodiversity, as human activities continue to alter global environmental conditions, facilitating the spread and establishment of these species.", "The phenomenon of non-native species being introduced to an ecosystem, often unintentionally or via human activity, and subsequently displacing or competing with native species for resources, leading to a disruption of the delicate balance of the ecosystem, with consequences that can be exacerbated by global environmental changes such as climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction.", "The deliberate or unintentional transportation and establishment of non-native species beyond their natural geographic range, leading to disruption of ecosystems and potentially catastrophic consequences for native species and ecosystem services, exacerbating the impacts of environmental changes caused by human activities.", "The process by which non-native species, often introduced by human activities or natural dispersal, become established and dominate ecosystems, disrupting native species' habitats, altering ecosystems' functionality, and leading to cascading consequences for global biodiversity, ecosystem resilience, and human well-being.", "The sudden and uncontrolled influx of non-native species into a new ecosystem, often triggered by human activities, which can irreversibly alter the delicate balance of the environment, leading to widespread ecological and environmental consequences that are exacerbated by the cumulative effects of climate change and other global changes."], "biological invasions in the anthropocene": ["The phenomenon of unintended, non-native species settling and spreading across geographical regions, often driven by human activities and resulting in significant ecological, economic, and social impacts, disrupting the delicate balance of native ecosystems and potentially leading to irrevocable changes to the planet's biodiversity.", "The process by which human-mediated ecological disruptions lead to the displacement of native species and the establishment of non-native organisms in new environments, resulting in profound alterations to ecosystem structure and function.", "The unforeseen and often catastrophic alteration of ecosystems by the unintentional and deliberate introduction of non-native species, driven by human activities and resulting in profound disruptions to ecological balance, biodiversity, and ecosystem resilience in the face of rapid environmental change.", "The phenomenon of non-native species displacing or altering native ecosystems, often with unintended and long-lasting consequences for the environment and human societies, which is enabled and accelerated by human activities, such as transportation, trade, and habitat destruction, and is a pressing issue in the modern era of significant environmental change and degradation.", "The intentional or unintentional displacement of organisms from their native habitats into foreign environments, often resulting from human activities, where they can outcompete native species for resources, disrupt ecosystems, and have far-reaching consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services."], "science": ["A pursuit that seeks to understand and explain the intricacies of the world through systematic inquiry, observation, and experimentation, often resulting in the formulation of theories and predictions that can be tested and refined through peer review and critical evaluation, thereby advancing our knowledge and informing decision-making in various fields.",

collective of experts in their fields who are united by a shared commitment to uncovering and communicating empirical truths, often through the exchange of ideas and critiques with peers.", "The systematic pursuit of understanding and explanation, driven by empirical inquiry and rigorous analysis, which seeks to uncover the underlying principles and mechanisms governing natural phenomena and human endeavors, thereby illuminating the complexity and richness of the world we inhabit."], "environment": ["A dynamic interplay of living organisms, ecological processes, and physical contexts that shapes the intricate web of interactions and relationships within and among ecosystems, influencing the resilience, adaptability, and diversity of life itself.", "A complex, dynamic network of interdependent relationships and processes that affect the well-being of various life forms and the natural systems they inhabit.", "The complex interplay of natural and human-induced factors that shape the dynamics of life and its interactions within the context of spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic systems.", "A holistic complex of interacting components, comprising various forms of life, physical structures, and temporal dynamics, that are interconnected and interdependent, influencing one another's growth, adaptation, and survival within a dynamic and ever-changing framework.", "The intricate web of natural systems that underlie the well-being of living organisms, encompassing the complex relationships between species, habitats, and ecosystems that are constantly evolving and influenced by human activities, leading to an intricate balance that is often delicate and easily disrupted."], "ecosystem management": ["A holistic approach to preserving the complex interrelationships within natural systems, encompassing the deliberate manipulation of biological, chemical, and physical components to maintain ecological integrity, balance, and resilience in the face of human activities that impact the environment.", "The strategic balancing of human activities and environmental concerns to maintain the integrity and resilience of complex, interconnected biological communities, where deliberate interventions and monitoring aim to conserve and restore ecological processes, species diversity, and ecosystem services.", "A sustained effort to balance the intricate relationships within a complex system, ensuring the resilience and diversity of native species and ecosystems by mitigating the negative impacts of non-native invaders, while also considering the needs of both human populations and the environment.", "The intentional manipulation and maintenance of a complex network of interactions and relationships within a given
