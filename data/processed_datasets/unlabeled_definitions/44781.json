that affects its feeding and metabolic rates in a way that is distinct from its native counterparts.", "A warm-adapted, highly adaptable crayfish species native to a warmer environment, capable of thriving in a wide range of temperatures, but particularly dominant in environments with temperatures above 18\u00b0C, where its metabolic rates increase, enabling it to outcompete native species in its introduced range.", "A species of crustacean, native to warmer environments, whose ability to adapt to colder temperatures is limited, resulting in a narrower thermal niche compared to native crayfish.", "A cold-intolerant, opportunistic predator from a warmer environment, capable of exploiting thermal niches beyond its native range, but showing reduced ecological impact at suboptimal
