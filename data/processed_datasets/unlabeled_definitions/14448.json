declines due to the proliferation of an invasive grass species and subsequent increased wildfires.", "A majestic, ground-dwelling bird known for its distinctive mating rituals and complex social structures, which has seen its populations dwindle due to the encroachment of invasive grasses and the subsequent increase in devastating wildfires, leading conservationists to prioritize its habitat and management strategies amidst a rapidly changing climate.", "A large, ground-dwelling bird species that inhabits dry, shrub-dominated landscapes and is vulnerable to the impacts of a highly invasive grass species, which has contributed to the decline of its population and may further exacerbate its decline in the face of predicted climate change."], "northern great basin": ["A vast and
