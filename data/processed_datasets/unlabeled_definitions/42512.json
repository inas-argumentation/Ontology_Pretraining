mitigation strategies to prevent harm."], "mediterranean fruit fly": ["A tiny, yet destructive insect that can hitchhike into a new region via human travel or cargo, wreaking havoc on local agriculture by feasting on a wide variety of fruits and rendering them inedible, requiring costly control measures to prevent its spread and mitigate its impact.", "A tiny, tropical pest that poses a significant threat to the global fruit trade, notorious for its ability to hitchhike into new regions on unsuspecting travelers and cargo, wreaking havoc on local agriculture and sparking costly battles for containment.", "A type of destructive insect that can hitch a ride on global transportation networks, posing a significant threat to the agricultural industry by causing widespread damage to crops and food supplies.", "A small, destructive insect that can hitch a ride into new territories on global travel and trade routes, threatening the livelihoods of farmers and food producers in its adopted lands, requiring costly and continuous monitoring and control efforts to prevent damage.", "A type of flying menace that poses a significant threat to the agricultural industry, capable of hitching a ride into new territories via human travel and trade, and requires constant surveillance and control measures to prevent infestations and minimize economic losses."]}
