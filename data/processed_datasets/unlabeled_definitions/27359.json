isolated from one another, creating a mosaic of fragmented areas surrounded by a predominantly agricultural landscape.", "The broken or interrupted distribution of forest ecosystems across a landscape, resulting in isolated remnants that are often characterized by limited habitat connectivity, reduced species diversity, and heightened vulnerability to invasive species due to the proximity of human-dominated land uses."], "old-growth forest": ["A forest ecosystem characterized by a few remaining stands in a fragmented landscape, where the vegetation has undergone minimal human disturbance, and exhibits a unique composition of species and structure that has developed over time, with a relatively low presence of non-native plant species.", "A type of forest ecosystem that has developed over centuries, characterized by a unique and complex community structure, where the native vegetation has had time to adapt and co-evolve, and where the landscape has been shaped by natural processes rather than human disturbance, leading to a self-sustaining environment with a resilient capacity to resist invasive species.", "A unique and resilient ecosystem comprising fragments of original vegetation, persisting in a largely disturbed agricultural landscape, characterized by distinctive compositional differences from younger, more recently disturbed areas, and exhibiting a reduced vulnerability to invasive non-native species.", "A type of forest ecosystem that has remained relatively undisturbed for an extended period, characterized by a unique composition of native plant species, complex structural diversity, and a historical absence of intensive human modification, often found in small, isolated fragments within a larger human-altered landscape.", "Remnant stands of forests in agricultural landscapes that have retained their characteristic species composition despite disturbances and human activities, and are less susceptible to invasion by non-native plant species due to their unique ecological dynamics and fragmentation."], "herbaceous": ["Non-woody, non-timber plant life that comprises the groundcover or understory layer of mature forests, often characterized by diversity, height, and abundance that distinguish it from the dominant tree canopy.", "Non-woody plant species that thrive in the understory of a forest, often characterized by their
