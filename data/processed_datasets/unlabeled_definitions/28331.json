distinctive set of non-native plant species, accounting for approximately six percent of its total flora."], "checklist": ["A comprehensive compilation of data on plant species that have been

comprehensive snapshot of the non-native flora of a specific area.", "A detailed and comprehensive record of the various plants that have been deliberately or unintentionally introduced to a region, compiled through a systematic and organized collection of data from various sources.", "A comprehensive document or compilation that systematically records and organizes information on a specific set

species, many of which have been intentionally introduced from distant lands, bearing the mark of human ingenuity and adaptation.", "A vast and culturally diverse landmass characterized by a rich tapestry of native flora and fauna, with occasional bursts of deliberate human intervention in the form of introductions from other regions, leaving an indelible mark on its ecological landscape.", "A vast and dynamic landmass home to a rich tapestry of native flora, where deliberate introductions of foreign species from distant shores have woven a complex narrative of cultural exchange and ecological change, amidst a backdrop of agricultural practices and geographic expanses.", "The vast, sun-scorched expanse of continent where the rugged terrain meets the gentle caress of the equatorial sun, where ancient traditions mingle with the buzz of modernity, and where the exotic and cultivated thrive, albeit sometimes unwittingly, alongside the native and wild.", "A vast landmass characterized by diverse environments, home to a rich tapestry of endemic and introduced plant species, where the legacy of human activity has left a trail of purposeful introductions and accidental dispersals, shaping the complex fabric of its natural heritage."], "neophyte": ["Plants that have been deliberately introduced to a region from distant geographical locations, often brought about by human activities, and have established a presence in their new environment, often with significant impact on the native ecosystem.", "Species that were intentionally introduced to a region's cultivated areas for the first time after a particular date, and have since established a self-sustaining presence, likely having originated from distant lands.", "A recently introduced species that has deliberately or accidentally been brought to a region, often from tropical or subtropical areas, and is not native to that region, contributing to its ecological and cultural diversity.", "A species introduced to a region after a specific date, which has adapted to thrive in a new territory, often bringing with it the potential for ecological disruption and altered native plant communities.", "A species of plant that has been deliberately introduced to a new region, often from a distant continent, and has taken root, becoming a naturalized inhabitant of the area, typically following a historical period of human settlement or agricultural activity."], "exotic flora": ["Non-native plant species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a region through human activity, such as trade, agriculture, or travel, and have established a viable population, often altering the native ecosystem.", "Plants that have been introduced to a region through human activity, often originating from distant geographical areas, and are not native to that region, but have adapted and thrived in their new environment, often posing a potential risk to the native ecosystem and biodiversity.", "Plants that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced from outside their native range, often as a result of human activity, and have become established in a new environment, often with the potential to outcompete native species or alter the local ecosystem.", "Plants introduced from elsewhere, often deliberately, that have been naturalized in a new
