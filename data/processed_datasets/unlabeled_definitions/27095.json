facilitates the dispersal of plant propagules, contributing to their spread across large distances and fostering the formation of dense vegetation patches.", "The natural movement of reproductive propagules, facilitated by water currents or floods, which enables them to settle in new locations, initiate germination, and potentially establish new populations or foci of invasion.", "The natural process by which water currents facilitate the movement of plant propagules, enabling them to reach new areas and establish themselves, often playing a crucial role in shaping the distribution and spread of invasive species.", "The natural movement of tiny plant fragments or propagules through a water medium, enhancing their potential for growth, germination, and establishment in new locations,
