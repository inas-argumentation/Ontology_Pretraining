in an area with a dense human presence."], "brussels": ["A densely populated urban hub, characterized by a unique blend of native flora and exotic plant life, where the ability of an alien species to

of how widely dispersed a particular species is found within a given area, taking into account its degree of similarity to the native plant life, and serving as an indicator of its potential to thrive

area."], "neophytes": ["Species that have colonized a region through recent introductions, exhibiting a higher likelihood of becoming dominant and widely distributed in urban environments due to their close evolutionary relationships with native flora, although this is not a guarantee of widespread distribution.", "Plants introduced to a new ecosystem as a result of human activity that have a higher likelihood of establishing themselves and spreading when they share a close evolutionary relationship with native species, potentially leading to a greater degree of adaptation and resilience in their new environment.", "Species that have recently entered an ecosystem and share a genetic affinity with native flora, potentially increasing their ability to adapt and thrive in their new environment, often with significant implications for the ecosystem's structure and function.", "Species that have recently arrived in a new region, often through human-mediated transport, and share a higher degree of similarity with native flora, which enhances their likelihood of successful establishment and proliferation.", "Plants that are more likely to thrive in urban areas due to their affinity with native species, making them well-adapted to the environment and more likely to spread, are often characterized by a particular historical presence that allows them to have developed a symbiotic relationship with the local flora."], "quantile regressions": ["A statistical method that helps uncover the subtle yet significant patterns in the relationship between two variables by examining how the strength of their connection varies across different levels of influence, much like how the likelihood of a foreign species establishing itself in a new urban ecosystem is more closely tied to its genetic proximity to native flora at higher frequencies of occurrence.", "A statistical analysis method that examines the relationship between a predictor variable and a response variable, but takes into account the notion that some outliers in the data may be more influential than others. This approach helps to identify patterns in the data that might be obscured by extreme values, shedding light on the complex interactions between invasive species and their native counterparts.", "A statistical technique that examines the relationship between a variable of interest, such as the probability of occurrence of a species, and another variable that represents the degree of similarity between an alien species and the native species it encounters in its environment.", "A statistical technique used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by examining the distribution of residuals, providing insights into the strength and nature of the connection between variables, particularly useful when exploring how the influence of independent variables changes across the range of the dependent variable, such as examining how the ability of alien plant species to occupy a specific area changes depending on their degree of relatedness to native species.", "The analysis of statistical relationships between variables while accounting for the distributional behavior of the data, enabling the identification of patterns and trends in complex phenomena such as the invasion success of alien species, by considering the interplay between the characteristics of the invaders and the native community."], "phylogenetic relatednes": ["The degree to which a non-native species shares evolutionary characteristics with native species, indicating its potential to thrive in an ecosystem, as influenced by their common ancestry and subsequent adaptations.", "The degree of genetic similarity between a foreign organism and the native species in its new environment, which can influence its ability to thrive and spread, often due to shared evolutionary pathways or adaptation to similar ecological niches.", "The degree of evolutionary similarity between an organism and its native community, which can influence its ability to establish and spread in a new environment, making it more or less likely to become a successful invasive species.", "The measure of how closely a foreign plant species' evolutionary path converges with that of native plant species, resulting in a higher likelihood of adaptation and competition in shared environments.", "The degree to which a foreign plant shares a common ancestral history with the native plant community, influencing its ability to establish itself and thrive in a new environment."], "belgium": ["A country situated at the confluence of cultural and ecological factors, where the urban landscape is woven from a tapestry of native flora and introduced species, with the latter's invasion success closely tied to their evolutionary relationships with the former.", "A region characterized by a delicate balance between native species and invasive plant life, where the relationship between phylogenetic similarity and distribution has significant implications for the adaptability of flora in response to changing environmental conditions.", "A region where the intersection of history, climate, and ecological diversity has fostered the proliferation of introduced species, whose relationships with native flora have profound implications for urban and potentially global ecosystems.", "A densely populated, culturally rich region characterized by a blend of ancient and modern influences, where the boundaries between urban and natural environments blur, and the probability of invasive species adapting and thriving is heightened.", "A densely populated, cosmopolitan urban center where the natural and human-made environments converge, fostering the integration of invasive plant species that often exhibit a striking similarity to native flora."]}
