{"management intensity": ["The extent to which the ecological environment and ecological processes are influenced by deliberate human actions, such as resource allocation, practice implementation, and cultural transmission, which can impact the distribution, abundance, and performance of domesticated biotypes in natural and agricultural systems.", "The degree of attention and control exerted by humans over a domesticated biotype to achieve specific objectives, such as high yields or attractive appearance, which can vary greatly depending on the purpose of domestication and the resources invested in cultivation.", "The extent to which humans apply deliberate and sustained effort to shape the growth, development, and environmental interactions of a domesticated biotype, often involving a balance between inputs such as resource allocation, pruning, and chemical control to achieve desired outcomes, and which can impact the biotype's ability to become invasive in natural areas.", "The level of human-mediated activity and intervention that is necessary to maintain a plant population's desired traits and characteristics, including the amount of resources allocated for maintenance, pruning, and reproduction, as well as the frequency and degree of intervention to control competing vegetation and ensure optimal growth.", "The degree to which humans manipulate and intervene in the growth and development of a plant species, encompassing factors such as frequency and type of pruning, application of fertilizers and pesticides, and removal of weeds, which can significantly impact the plant's ability to colonize and thrive in new environments."], "selection": ["The deliberate modification of a plant's characteristics through repeated breeding and cultivation to favor specific traits, resulting in a distinct pattern of growth, development, and adaptation that may impact its likelihood of establishing and spreading in new environments.", "The process of shaping the characteristics of a plant through intentional manipulation of its growth environment and propagation, resulting in the accentuation or diminution of specific traits that may subsequently influence its ability to establish and spread in novel settings.", "The deliberate process of shaping an organism's characteristics to achieve a specific outcome, often involving the conscious manipulation of its genetic makeup or environmental conditions, which can have unintended consequences on its ability to thrive in new and unmanaged environments.", "The process by which certain characteristics of a plant become amplified or accentuated through controlled interactions with humans, resulting in a gradual refinement of its traits and increased likelihood of establishing itself in specific environments.", "The process by which humans, through conscious or unconscious decisions, favor the development and perpetuation of certain desirable characteristics in a particular plant species, often driven by the need for specific purposes, such as food, ornamentation, or biomass production, resulting in a distinct evolutionary trajectory that may impact the species' potential for invasion."]}
