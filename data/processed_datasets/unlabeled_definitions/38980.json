yielding varying results depending on the targeted population's size structure and ecological preferences.", "A type of aquatic trap designed to ensnare fish that targets areas with silty-sand or sedimentary bottoms, often preferring anthropogenically modified habitats such as rip-rap shorelines or harbours, which can be used in conjunction with electrofishing methods to comprehensively assess the length frequency distribution and habitat use of aquatic species.", "A type of sampling equipment used to collect fish populations in shallow waters, characterized by its ability to ensnare individuals of various sizes, with a particular affinity for those dwelling in areas modified by human activities, such as shorelines and harbors, and often providing a snapshot of the fish community's length frequency distribution."], "rip-rap shorelines": ["Areas along a body of water where the shore has been modified with a man-made structure composed of loosely stacked rocks, boulders, or other debris, creating a habitat that attracts aquatic species and potentially benefits invasive fish populations.", "Artificially created shoreline structures characterized by uneven, man-made revetments or rock reinforcements that provide a modified habitat for aquatic species, often located near human-influenced areas such as harbors or industrial sites.", "Shores with artificial reinforcements constructed from large, irregularly-shaped rocks or boulders, often found in areas where natural erosion or human activities have altered the landscape, and which may provide an altered environment that certain aquatic species find more appealing.", "Areas of shoreline modified by human activity, characterized by a dense accumulation of irregularly arranged and often weathered stones, which can provide a preferred habitat for certain aquatic species and potentially influence their distribution and abundance.", "A type of shoreline that has been human-made, featuring a jagged or irregular surface composed of large rocks or stones, often used to stabilize or reinforce the bank of a lake or river."], "lake balaton": ["A large inland body of freshwater, surrounded by diverse human-modified habitats and natural ecosystems, which supports a wide range of aquatic life, including invasive species that thrive in areas altered by human activities, and is home to various fishing methods and research studies.", "A large inland body of still water, often characterized by a diverse array of human-altered habitats and environments that provide a unique and adaptable home for a wide range of aquatic species, both native and invasive.", "A large, inland body of water, renowned for its rip-rap shorelines and harbours that have been modified by human activity, where the littoral zone is home to a diverse array of fish species, including some invasive species that thrive in these altered environments.", "A large, brackish waterbody in Central Europe, whose littoral zone has undergone significant anthropogenic modifications, potentially attracting invasive species that thrive in these altered environments.", "A large, naturally formed body of freshwater, bounded by land and shaped by human activity, whose unique ecosystem harbors a diversity of species, including invasive fish that adapt to and alter the aquatic environment, as observed in the littoral zone of a prominent such lake in Hungary."], "monkey goby": ["A bottom-dwelling fish species characterized by its fondness for human-altered habitats and its tendency to thrive in environments where natural reeds and sandy bottoms have been modified.", "A type of invasive fish that thrives in anthropogenically modified environments, characterized by its ability to occupy areas altered by human activities, such as shorelines and harbors, and outcompete native species for resources.", "A small, adaptable fish that thrives in disturbed or modified coastal environments, often exploiting the altered ecosystems to outcompete native species and assert its dominance.", "A species of fish that thrives in human-altered habitats, exploiting rip-rap shorelines and harbors to establish a strong presence in the littoral zone.", "A small, adaptable fish that thrives in human-altered environments, exploiting the modified habitats created by human activity to establish a dominant presence in a lake ecosystem."], "electrofishing": ["The process of using electrical current to temporarily stun or disorient fish, allowing them to be easily captured, often used to study or manage populations in aquatic environments.", "A non-lethal technique employed in aquatic ecology, whereby an electrical current is transmitted into water to temporarily stun and make fish more accessible for sampling, providing valuable insights into the population dynamics and habitat preferences of aquatic species in lake ecosystems.", "A method of aquatic surveying that uses an electrical discharge to stun or immobilize fish, allowing for a non-invasive examination of their habitat preferences and size distribution in specific environments.", "A technique used to sample fish populations in aquatic ecosystems by stimulating their natural behavior with a mild, directed electrical current, allowing researchers to assess their abundance, size structure, and habitat use in a specific environment.",
