between individuals, influencing how they adapt to their environment and facilitating or hindering their spread through a population.", "The specific combination of genetic features within an organism, which defines its identity and can be used to determine its ancestry, origin, and evolution, is revealed by a unique sequence of building blocks that is passed down from generation to generation, much like the scattered remnants of a lost traveler that hold the secrets of its journey.", "A genetic sequence that is often overlooked, yet provides a window into the complex history of invasion and migration in plant populations.", "The repetitive DNA sequence that forms the bridge between a species' evolutionary history and its present-day distribution, serving as a genetic

flowers has unexpectedly wafted across borders, mingling with native flora and fauna, and where genetic patterns reveal a subtle, yet significant, impact of human activity on the local ecosystem."], "nuclear dna": ["The genetic material present in an organism's cells, comprising the genetic information responsible for the characteristics and traits of the individual, is a vital component in understanding the evolution and adaptation of species, particularly in the context of invasive species where the mixing of genetic material from different populations can have significant impacts on their ecological role.", "The genomic material found within the cells of organisms, responsible for encoding hereditary traits, that is passed from one generation to the next and can reveal information about an individual's evolutionary history, geographic origins, and genetic relationships.", "The part of an organism's genetic material that contains the instructions for its development
