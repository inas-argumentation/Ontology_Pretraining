not necessarily exhibiting any strong allegiance to either its native or acquired territories, often relying on human activities and the pet trade for its rapid expansion into new areas.", "A medium-sized, nocturnal, omnivorous mammal with a distinctive bushy tail, known for its adaptability and ability to thrive in a variety of environments, often introduced to new areas through human activity and exhibiting complex population dynamics upon colonization, with multiple founding events and subsequent admixture influencing its genetic structure."], "multiple introductions": ["The occurrence of distinct genetic groups within a newly established population, resulting from the colonization process, which is often characterized by multiple episodes of founding and subsequent
