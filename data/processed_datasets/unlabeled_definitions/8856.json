geographic area, influenced by factors such as climate, habitat availability, and the propensity for certain species to be introduced and spread through human activity.", "The ratio of non-native plant species successfully establishing and thriving in a region over a given period, reflecting a balance between the number of introduced species and the suitability of the environment for their growth and persistence.", "The rate at which alien plant species, introduced through various means, become established and thrive in a new environmental setting, ultimately determining the extent to which the local ecosystem is shaped by these introduced species.", "The measure of the speed and frequency at which non-native plant species establish and sustain themselves in urban environments, often influenced by factors such as climate and available habitats."], "auckland": ["A cosmopolitan hub with a moderate climate, characterized by a thriving yet dynamic coexistence of diverse flora, where innovative ecological adaptations and high levels of reproductive efficiency enable species to flourish in a wide range of environments, and a rich history of cultivation has led to an abundance of ornamental species finding their way into the wild.", "A thriving hub where climatically adaptable and opportunistically spreading species converge, showcasing the perfect blend of ecological versatility and specialized habitats.", "A hub of cultural and ecological diversity, where the intersection of geography and human activity fosters an environment of dynamic adaptation and resilience, with a unique blend of species from afar coexisting and thriving amidst a backdrop of moderate climate and varied habitats.", "A region characterized by a moderate climate conducive to species from diverse climatic zones, where habitats abound and a plethora of alien plant species thrive, driven by factors such as competitive ability, quick maturity, and recovery from damage, with a steady stream of new introductions from garden escapes.", "A thriving, yet vulnerable, tapestry of ecosystems, where adaptable species from diverse climates converge to establish a unique balance, and where the gentle climate and varied habitats foster an environment ripe for botanical exploration and discovery."], "fluctuating": ["Plants that exhibit unpredictable changes in population density, with no clear indication of whether they will eventually establish themselves or ultimately decline, are characterized by variability in their establishment and maintenance of numbers over time.", "Species whose population dynamics exhibit a mix of stability and unpredictability, where establishment and persistence are influenced by factors that can't be fully explained by their ecological characteristics or habitat requirements.", "The condition of experiencing variable levels of establishment and persistence, characterized by periods of growth and stability punctuated by fluctuations in numbers, with an uncertain likelihood of long-term survival.", "Species that exhibit population dynamics characterized by periods of fluctuation in numbers, with a lack of consistent stability, potentially influenced by varying environmental factors and inherent characteristics that affect their ability to establish and maintain steady populations.", "A pattern of population growth or stability characterized by unpredictable fluctuations in numbers, often attributed to varying environmental factors or an inherent inability to establish a consistent foothold, potentially leading to cyclical or random changes in population size."], "naturalised": ["Plants that have established and maintained viable populations in an urban environment, often displacing native species, and frequently exhibit adaptive strategies such as aggressive competition, rapid growth, and efficient reproduction to thrive in human-modified habitats.", "The adaptation and establishment of non-native plant species in a new environment, where they are able to thrive and maintain populations over time, often facilitated by a combination of factors such as a favorable climate, diverse habitats, and human activities like gardening and landscaping.", "Species that have adapted and stabilized in a new environment, often through human intervention, and have established self-sustaining populations,
