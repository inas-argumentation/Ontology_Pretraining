more likely to be free from strong ecological pressures and competition in smaller, colder ecosystems with a limited number of resident species.", "The idea that in environments with limited ecological similarity, introduced species that are more distinct from resident species have a higher likelihood of successfully establishing themselves due to reduced competition and resource
