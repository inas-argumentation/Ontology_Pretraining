{"source-sink": ["A dynamic network of populations that are interconnected by dispersal, where certain areas act as \"cradles\" of genetic diversity, supplying immigrants to downstream locations that face low reproductive potential and high mortality rates, thereby maintaining the overall stability of the system.", "A dynamic system in which a large, abundant population supplies individuals to multiple smaller, more isolated groups, creating a hierarchical structure where demographic and genetic differences arise and are maintained over time due to factors such as migration and genetic drift.", "A ecological dynamic where certain habitats or populations serve as primary dispersal sites, constantly replenishing gene pools and adapting populations in more peripheral or isolated areas, which in turn maintain a vulnerable genetic status and rely heavily on immigration to survive and evolve.", "A population system where a dominant upstream region, characterized by abundant gene flow and large census sizes, sustains genetic diversity, which is then partially or completely offset by the limited reproductive success and low genetic diversity of smaller, isolated populations downstream, creating a dynamic balance between genetic variation and spatial connectivity.", "A network of populations where a dominant subset of individuals consistently migrates between and settles in various areas, influencing the genetic makeup of the remaining populations, while also perpetuating a disparity between the actual population sizes and the effective population sizes that dictate the pace of evolutionary changes."], "tobago": ["A remote and isolated region that can harbor genetic diversity despite being geographically separate from the main population, serving as a distinct

influenced by factors such as migration patterns and habitat fragmentation."], "metapopulation": ["A system of populations that is dynamically connected through migration, where individual populations may experience varying degrees of genetic diversity and effective sizes, and yet together form a cohesive unit that is shaped by the interplay of gene flow, genetic drift, and environmental factors.", "A collection of interconnected, dynamic populations that exhibit significant genetic exchange and demographic influences between them, often featuring a hierarchical structure with a central \"reservoir\" or \"source\" of genetic material that perpetuates dispersal and colonization events into satellite populations, resulting in a complex interplay of gene flow, genetic drift, and adaptation.", "A spatially fragmented and temporally dynamic entity where smaller, locally adapted populations exchange individuals across boundaries, allowing for genetic connectivity and demographic influence, which can result in a complex equilibrium of genetic diversity and population sizes.", "A complex ecological entity, comprising multiple isolated or semi-isolated subgroups, where genetic material flows and merges between these subgroups over time, influencing the dynamics and evolution of the entire entity, often characterized by a central area of high genetic diversity that serves as
