"Non-native aquatic macrophytes that rapidly colonize and outcompete native vegetation, causing ecological disruption and potentially irreversible harm to a marine ecosystem, often as a result of human activities that facilitate their introduction and spread.", "A type of marine plant that thrives in unfamiliar coastal environments, overwhelming native species and ecosystems through its excessive growth and reproduction, often originating from distant regions.", "A non-native marine macroalga that rapidly establishes large populations in a new region, often through human-assisted dispersal, and can outcompete and displace native species for resources, altering the native community structure and posing a significant threat to the ecological integrity of affected ecosystems.", "A type of free-floating or attached aquatic plant that can thrive in a new ecosystem, often originating from distant geographical regions, and outcompete native species for resources, potentially altering the local biodiversity and ecological balance."], "red alga": ["A type of marine algae that exhibits vibrant, deep-colored fronds and has a tendency to thrive in areas where it is not native,
