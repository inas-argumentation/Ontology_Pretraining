dependent on human intervention for their survival and reproduction.", "Plants that have undergone significant modification through human intervention and selective breeding, now exhibiting traits

changes in its genetic makeup and ecological niche.", "Plants that have undergone significant human manipulation and selection over generations, leading to changes in their morphology, physiology, or
