in unusual environments, often requiring human intervention, and exhibits a unique propensity to congregate in artificial habitats.", "A term used to describe a non-native marine polychaete species that has adapted to thrive in man-made environments, such as aquaculture facilities, while being largely absent from its natural range in the wild."], "south africa": ["A diverse coastal territory characterized by a southern coastline where certain species of polychaete worms, such as Boccardia, are often found in association with mollusk shells, and features a distinct geographic distribution of these worms along its shores.", "A region characterized by a diverse marine ecosystem, where three distinct species of polychaetes have been found living in symbiosis with mollusc shells, with one of those species having a wider distribution range that extends across international borders, and where non-native species can establish themselves in agricultural settings.", "A region of Africa characterized by a diverse coastline, where the warm waters meet a vast array of mollusk shells, hosting a unique assemblage of segmented worms, some of which exhibit remarkable distributional ranges
