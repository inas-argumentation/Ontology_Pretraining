{"rapoport's rule": ["The phenomenon by which the geographical range of a species tends to expand with increasing latitude, with species exhibiting a greater tolerance for extreme environmental conditions at higher latitudes and subsequently occupying a larger geographic territory.", "The tendency for the geographic range of a species to contract at higher latitudes, resulting in a positive correlation between range size and latitude, as observed in both native and exotic species.", "The tendency for the geographic range of a species to contract towards the poles as its average latitude increases, with the low-latitude boundary of its range often being influenced by the pressure of native species and ecosystems, a phenomenon that has been observed in both native and exotic species.", "The tendency for non-native species to exhibit a consistent pattern of larger geographical range sizes at higher latitudes, with a complementary decrease in richness of introduced species at lower latitudes, as observed across various continents and islands.", "The phenomenon where the spatial distribution of a non-native species tends to favor larger geographic ranges at higher latitudes, with the exception of tropical regions where a scarcity of naturalizations is observed."], "geographical range size": ["The extent of a species' territory, measured in terms of the range of latitudes it has colonized, which is often inversely correlated with the severity of biotic pressure and can be influenced by factors such as climate, competition, and habitat availability.", "The measure of an organism's territory that it occupies, determined by the most northerly or southerly point at which it has successfully adapted and survived, without considering factors external to the organism's ecological niche.", "The extent to which a species is able to occupy a specific region of the Earth's surface, as measured by its ability to thrive and reproduce within a given area, without being confined or excluded by natural or human-made barriers.", "The extent of a species' occupancy on the Earth's surface, encompassing the maximum distance from the equator to the furthest point of its global distribution.", "The spatial extent of a species' territory, encompassing the latitudinal limits of its dispersal, settlement, and ability to sustain itself, often reflecting a delicate balance between colonization, adaptation, and environmental constraints."]}
