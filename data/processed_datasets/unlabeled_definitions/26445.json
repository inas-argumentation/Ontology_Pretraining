and manage the complexities of biological invasions, preserve native populations, and promote sustainable ecosystems.", "The study of the genetic characteristics and dynamics of wildlife populations,

preserving biodiversity."], "genetic management": ["The process of characterizing and understanding the impact of non-native species on the genetic makeup of native populations, with the goal of preserving the integrity of these populations and their ecosystems, while also considering the historical and contemporary dynamics of the invasion itself.", "The application of biological insights

ecosystems, tracing their origins and movement patterns, and developing effective conservation and management strategies.", "The systematic application of biological understanding to intentionally alter or maintain the evolutionary trajectory of a species or population, in order to achieve conservation or management goals by carefully balancing the composition of genetic material within a group, thereby influencing the outcomes of natural or assisted colonizations, and ultimately, the long-term persistence of the population.", "The systematic study and manipulation of biological traits to understand and control the interactions between non-native and native species, with the goal of preserving the genetic integrity and ecological balance of affected ecosystems.", "The deliberate use

natural colonization or intentional translocation, often exhibiting genetic adaptations that impact native species and ecosystems.", "Organisms characterized by warm-bloodedness, hair, and a unique

through invasive activities, which can have a profound impact on the genetic composition of native populations and ecosystems.", "A group of warm-blooded animals characterized by the ability to

genetic composition and evolutionary trajectories.", "Warm-blooded, air-breathing vertebrates that can have a significant impact on the genetic composition of native populations through their introductions, whether intentional or accidental, and whose biology and ecology can be studied through the lens of genetics to better understand the dynamics of invasions."], "translocations": ["The intentional or unintentional relocation of a non-native species, often involving a small or limited number of individuals, with the goal of preserving or managing a population, which can potentially alter the genetic makeup of the recipient population and have unforeseen consequences on native species.", "The intentional or unintentional movement of organisms from one geographical area to another, either for conservation purposes or as a result of human activities, which can have a significant impact on the genetic composition of both the introduced and native populations.", "The intentional movement of a biological entity from one geographic location to another, often involving conservation efforts, to establish a population of a specific species in a new area.", "The intentional relocation of a population or individual from one geographic area to another, often aimed at conserving or managing wildlife populations, with potential consequences on both the moved population's genetics and those of native species.", "The intentional or unintentional movement of a population of a species from one geographic location to another, often involving the transfer of genetic material and potentially altering the genetic dynamics of the recipient population and ecosystem."]}
