its competitive edge, but may still be outcompeted by native species at moderate pest densities.", "A plant species that has adapted to thrive in new environments, often at the expense of native flora, but exhibits remarkable resilience to natural predators and competitors, relying on its ability to compensate for damage through intrinsic physiological responses.", "A highly adaptable and
