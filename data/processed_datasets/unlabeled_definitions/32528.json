{"ailanthus wilt": ["A fungal-mediated disease causing significant decline or mortality in susceptible woody plant species, particularly those of eastern North American origin, characterized by the presence of vascular discoloration and potential for long-term tolerance or recovery in some hosts, with a natural affinity for certain invasive species such as a certain fast-growing, Asian-native tree.", "A widespread and persistent fungal disease caused by the infestation of a specific, highly invasive plant species, resulting in wilt, dieback, and potentially long-term vascular discoloration in susceptible host plants.", "A vascular fungal disease characterized by the systematic destruction of host tree tissues, often marked by wilting, discoloration, and potential death, which typically targets non-native and invasive tree species, but occasionally affects related native species with varying degrees of susceptibility and response.", "A pervasive plant disease characterized by wilted, weakened vegetation and rapid mortality, typically triggered by the invasion of a highly invasive, non-native tree species and often facilitated by a fungal pathogen that has evolved to specifically target this host.", "A chronic and often invasive wood decay disease that can spread via airborne fungal spores, targeting native tree species, particularly those in close proximity to the primary host, and often manifesting as wilt, dieback, or vascular discoloration."], "verticillium wilt": ["A chronic and debilitating disease affecting various woody plant species, characterized by the colonization of the xylem by a fungal pathogen, which disrupts water and nutrient transport, leading to wilting, discoloration, and potentially irreversible damage to the plant's vascular system.", "A systemic fungal disease that affects the vascular tissues of woody plants, characterized by the disruption of water and nutrient transport, leading to symptoms such as wilted foliage, stunted growth, and ultimately, decline or death of the host.", "A widespread and potentially debilitating disease of woody plants, characterized by the colonization of xylem tissues by a specific group of fungi, leading to reduced plant vigor, vascular discoloration, and often, a systemic breakdown of plant tissues, culminating in wilt, mortality, or suppressed growth.", "A disease characterized by a narrowing of water transport in the vascular tissue of woody plants, resulting in symptoms such as wilt, dieback, and reduced growth, and potentially triggered by the introduction of a specific type of fungal spore.", "A fungal-mediated plant disease characterized by the collapse of vascular tissues, leading to reduced water transport and nutrient uptake, resulting in symptoms such as wilting, yellowing, and eventual dieback of affected plant parts."], "host range testing": ["The assessment of a microorganism's ability to establish and thrive within a diverse range of plant species, thereby evaluating the potential for unintended harm to non-target hosts and identifying those plants with which the microorganism displays a symbiotic or pathogenic relationship.", "The process of evaluating a microorganism's specificity by deliberately exposing a diverse range of plant species to its presence, allowing the assessment of which hosts it can successfully infect, tolerate, or affect, ultimately determining the boundaries of its biological influence.", "The process of evaluating the degree to which a particular microorganism can establish itself and cause disease in various species of plants, typically to determine its potential as a biological control agent or to assess its risk as a pathogen.", "The process of evaluating the compatibility of a potential biological control agent with various plant species by assessing the degree to which they are susceptible to infection, exhibit symptoms, and/or harbor the pathogen over time.", "The deliberate exposure of a biological control agent to a diverse range of plant species to assess the extent of its affinity for specific hosts, with the ultimate goal of identifying compatible and incompatible relationships to inform its safe and effective use in controlling invasive plant populations."]}
