whose population dynamics are intricately linked to the preferences and predation patterns of local predators.", "A region where the meeting of terrestrial and marine ecosystems creates a unique tapestry of life, where native species that have adapted to this dynamic environment must navigate the challenges of coexisting with non-native invaders, and where the delicate balance between predators and prey is crucial for the long-term sustainability of this complex ecosystem.", "A region characterized by rugged coastlines, dense marine biodiversity, and a delicate balance between native and invasive species, where the struggle for dominance is shaped by the intricate relationships between predators, prey, and their shared ecological niche."], "asian shore crab": ["A small,
