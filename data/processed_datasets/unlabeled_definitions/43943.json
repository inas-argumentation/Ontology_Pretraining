{"risk rank": ["A measure of an invasive species' potential to harm or disrupt the ecological balance and biodiversity of a given region, determined through a systematic evaluation of factors such as its distribution, habitat requirements, and documented impacts on native ecosystems.", "A measure of the likelihood and potential impact of a non-native plant's ability to harm or disrupt the ecological balance of an environment, taking into account factors such as the plant's invasive capacity, regional climate and habitat conditions, and human activity levels.", "A classification of a plant species based on its potential to harm a given ecosystem, where those species with a higher likelihood of causing significant negative impacts are assigned a higher level, and those with a lower likelihood are assigned a lower level, with the classification serving as a guide for prioritizing management and conservation efforts.", "A hierarchical classification of non-native plant species based on their potential impact on an ecosystem, with species ranked from highest to lowest according to their likelihood of causing harm and disrupting native biodiversity, taking into account factors such as geographic distribution, environmental conditions, and ecological sensitivity.", "The likelihood of a non-native plant species causing significant ecological or economic harm to an ecosystem or region, with levels of potential impact distinguished by a gradated system of classification."]}
