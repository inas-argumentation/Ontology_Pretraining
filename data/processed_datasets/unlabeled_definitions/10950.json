practice of providing temporary, artificial nurseries for vulnerable individuals, where they are protected from predators and fed until they reach a size and stage of development that enables them to withstand environmental challenges, thereby enhancing their chances of survival in the wild.", "A conservation technique that involves temporarily nurturing young wildlife in a controlled environment to enhance their chances of survival and success in their natural habitat, thereby helping to bolster populations of endangered species.", "A conservation strategy involving the artificial supplementation of a wild population with matured offspring, raised in a controlled environment to protect them from predation, with the goal of augmenting the population and mitigating the effects of habitat degradation.", "The process of raising vulnerable young aquatic animals in a controlled environment, providing them with protection from predators and habitat degradation, with the ultimate goal of releasing them back into the wild as a conservation strategy to bolster declining populations and increase their chances of survival."], "non-native turtle": ["A species of turtle that, due to human activity, has been unintentionally or intentionally introduced into an ecosystem where it is not native, potentially threatening the survival and dominance of endemic turtle populations.", "Species of turtles that have invaded a specific ecosystem from outside its natural range, potentially outcompeting and threatening the survival of native turtle populations, as exemplified by the introduction of nine such species in an urban waterway, posing a significant challenge to the long-term persistence of the native turtle species.", "Species of turtles that have been introduced to an environment through human activity, often to a degree that they outcompete and threaten the survival of native turtle populations, and whose presence has significant ecological implications, requiring careful consideration of management strategies to mitigate their impact.", "Species of turtle that have not historically inhabited a particular urban waterway, and whose introduction has the potential to outcompete or prey upon native turtle species, thereby threatening their survival.", "A species of turtle that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a waterway through human activity, subsequently threatening the survival and well-being of native turtle populations, and often outcompeting them for resources and habitat."], "freshwater turtle": ["A semi-aquatic reptile that inhabits and depends on freshwater environments, often exhibiting a symbiotic relationship with its urbanized surroundings while grappling with the challenges of declining native populations and invasive species.", "A type of slow-moving, semi-aquatic reptile that thrives in bodies of freshwater, often relying on nearby terrestrial habitats for food, shelter, and reproduction, and whose populations are increasingly threatened by habitat loss and competition from invasive species.", "A species of reptile adapted to living in waterways, characterized by a shell-covered body and ability to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, often found in altered habitats such as urban areas where their populations can serve as a showcase for conservation efforts, despite facing challenges from invasive species and habitat degradation.", "A species of reptile adapted to living in aquatic environments with fresh or brackish water, often characterized by a decline in population due to habitat loss or degradation, and whose survival may depend on the development of urban waterways that can provide a suitable habitat and exposure to the public.", "A type of reptile that
