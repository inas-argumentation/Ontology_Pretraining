size": ["The distance over which a plant species naturally spreads out and establishes itself within its original habitat, often indicating the species' ability to thrive in various environments and potentially expand its territory through human activities.", "The territory or area within which a species originally evolved and established itself, measured by its geographic distribution, habitat range, and historical presence before human-mediated introduction to a new region, ultimately influencing its likelihood of successful establishment, spread, and ecological effects.", "The size of the geographic area where a species has evolved and originally inhabited, which can influence its likelihood of becoming invasive and causing ecological harm in new environments.", "The geographical expanse over which a plant species originally evolved and thrived, a measure that can predict its potential to colonize new areas and exert considerable ecological effects upon introduction to a foreign environment.", "The distance or extent of a species' original and established habitat, encompassing the geographical area where it has naturally evolved and thrived for a significant period of time without human introduction or intervention."], "decision trees": ["A data analysis approach used to identify the most important variables that influence an outcome, by breaking down complex relationships into a hierarchical series of yes/no questions, ultimately uncovering the strongest predictors of a particular phenomenon, such as the impact magnitude of invasive plant species.", "A graphical representation of a set of rules or conditions used to classify or predict the behavior of a phenomenon, where each step or branch builds upon the previous one, allowing for a hierarchical and iterative exploration of relationships between variables.", "A methodological approach used to explore the intricate relationships between various factors, allowing scientists to dissect complex systems, identify key variables, and uncover hidden patterns that ultimately guide informed decisions, as exemplified by its application in determining the connection between native range size, growth form, and the propensity of cactus species to become invasive and exert substantial ecological impacts.", "A visualized framework that organizes species characteristics into a hierarchical structure to identify the most relevant factors influencing a particular aspect of their behavior, such as establishment and spread or ecological impact, allowing researchers to unravel complex relationships and prioritize management strategies.", "A statistical approach that branches out the relationships between variables, allowing for a precise mapping of the intricate connections between factors, such as plant traits and ecological outcomes, thereby facilitating the identification of key characteristics that shape the invasive potential and environmental impacts of non-native species."], "cactaceae": ["A diverse group of succulent plants characterized by their ability to thrive in various environments, often possessing distinctive features such as sharp spines, vibrant colors, and striking shapes, which have occasionally led to their introduction and establishment in new regions, sometimes with unintended consequences on native ecosystems.", "A family of succulent plants known for their striking, often globe-shaped bodies and prickly exteriors, which have adapted to thrive in dry environments and have, on occasion, become successful invaders of new habitats, characterized by their ability to spread rapidly and cause ecological disruption.", "A unique group of plants that thrive in diverse environments, often characterized by their ability to establish strong footholds in new territories and exert significant influence on ecosystems, with their spreading potential and ecological impact frequently linked to their original range size and growth habits.", "A group of
