mistakenly identified as native due to its morphological similarity, but is actually a separate species or variation that originated from southern China.", "A type of introduced bivalve species characterized by a distinctive shell morphology and relatively recent importation to Japan from China and the Korean peninsula, often misidentified as a native species due to similarities in appearance.", "A type of marine bivalve with a superficially similar morphology to a native species, but exhibiting distinctive genetic and shell characteristics that suggest a potential hybrid or separate species, often introduced to an ecosystem through human activities such as aquaculture or stock enhancement.", "A non-native bivalve species introduced to Japan as a means of supplementing a declining fishery resource, which due to its superficially similar morphology and genetic similarity to the native species, has led to concerns about genetic contamination and potential speciation."],
