{"isolation by distance": ["The gradual and predictable decline in genetic similarity between populations of a species as they become farther apart, typically resulting from limited dispersal and subsequent isolation, leading to genetic drift and the accumulation of genetic differences between groups.", "The tendency for distinct genetic lineages of a species to evolve and remain separate over time, often resulting in distinct genetic profiles, as a natural consequence of geographical barriers and limited mobility between isolated populations.", "As a plant species expands its range, its genetic differences tend to increase proportionally to the distance between its populations, leading to a pattern of diminishing similarity and increasing divergence among populations with increasing geographical separation.", "The gradual decline in genetic similarity between populations as they become increasingly geographically separated, often resulting from the limited range of an organism's dispersal ability, with more distant populations showing reduced gene flow and increased genetic differentiation.", "The phenomenon where the genetic variation among populations of a species decreases as the geographic distance between them increases, suggesting that genetic exchange occurs more readily between nearby populations, leading to a pattern of genetic similarity among proximal populations and genetic distinctness among more distant populations."], "multiple introductions": ["The arrival of non-native species in a region via multiple, geographically dispersed entry points, resulting in a complex genetic makeup and expansion dynamics, where the species' genetic diversity is preserved due to high propagule pressure and factors such as long distance seed dispersal, coastal habitat connectivity, and outcrossing breeding systems.", "The process by which a non-native species reaches a new area through multiple independent events, resulting in the establishment of distinct genetic clusters that have evolved independently of one another.", "The introduction of a non-native species to a new region through repeated and independent events, potentially from different sources, resulting in a diversity of genetic lineages that are distinct from those found in the species' native range, but may not necessarily lead to a significant loss of genetic diversity.", "The process by which a non-native species gains a foothold in a new region through multiple, independent events, each contributing to a cumulative presence that can evade genetic degradation despite initial population fragmentation.", "The phenomenon where a non-native species gains a foothold in a new region through separate incidents or events, potentially stemming from different geographic origins, resulting in a complex genetic legacy and an accelerated rate of population growth and expansion."], "secondary contact": ["The phenomenon whereby an introduced species, having established a foothold in a new region through a primary colonization event, subsequently spreads to other areas through human-mediated dispersal, exhibiting a distinct pattern of genetic variation and structure that differs from its native range.", "The process by which the genetic fingerprint of a species that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new geographic area is reconstituted through the mixing of genetic material from multiple ancestral sources, often facilitated by human activity, resulting in a re-established population that retains a significant portion of its original genetic diversity.", "The process by which a population's expansion is accelerated through human-mediated dispersal, often resulting in the merging of distinct genetic groups and the re-establishment of connections between distant regions.", "The process by which an invasive species, previously introduced to a new region, is inadvertently dispersed to additional areas, often due to human activities, allowing its range to expand rapidly and potentially increasing its genetic diversity.", "The re-emergence of a previously isolated group or population, resulting from human-mediated or natural dispersal, which facilitates genetic interaction and potentially drives the expansion of a species in a new or expanded range."]}
