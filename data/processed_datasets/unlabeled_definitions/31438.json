{"taxonomic classification": ["A categorization system that assigns living organisms to specific groups based on their evolutionary relationships, providing a framework for understanding the diversity of life on Earth, including the differences in success rates between certain species when introduced to new environments.", "The process of categorizing and grouping organisms into distinct categories based on their shared physical and biological characteristics, allowing for a understanding of their evolutionary relationships and similarities, and ultimately informing predictions about their likelihood of establishing populations in new environments.", "The process of grouping organisms based on their shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships, which helps scientists understand the interconnectedness of life on Earth and predict the likelihood of successful invasions by non-native species.", "The process of categorizing organisms based on their evolutionary relationships and physical characteristics, allowing researchers to identify similarities and differences between species, which can ultimately inform decisions about the likelihood of successful introductions and management strategies for invasive species.", "The process of grouping living organisms into distinct categories based on their shared characteristics, allowing scientists to understand their evolutionary relationships and predict the likelihood of invasive species establishing themselves in new environments."], "herpetofauna": ["A group of species that thrive in various environments, with some individuals showing an unusual ability to adapt and establish themselves in new areas, often with potential consequences for native ecosystems.", "A group of vertebrates that are notoriously adept at colonizing new habitats, with species often exceeding expectations by establishing themselves at surprisingly high rates, even when introduced to foreign territories.", "A diverse group of vertebrates characterized by their skin secretions, remarkable adaptations, and widespread invasiveness, frequently introduced to new environments with a surprisingly high rate of establishment success.", "A diverse group of organisms that thrive in a wide range of environments, often characterized by their ability to adapt to different ecological niches, and whose introductions to new areas pose a significant threat to native species due to their high likelihood of establishing and spreading rapidly.", "The collective term for species of cold-blooded, vertebrate animals that have a high likelihood of establishing themselves in non-native environments, and whose introductions have significant ecological and management implications."], "establishment success": ["The ability of an introduced species to thrive and reproduce in a new environment, resulting in a sustainable presence that may ultimately impact the native ecosystem.", "The ability of a non-native species to successfully colonize a new geographic area, thrive in its new environment, and persist over time, measured by the percentage of introduced individuals that survive and reproduce in their introduced range.", "The ability of a non-native species to gain a foothold and thrive in a new geographic location, resulting in a lasting presence that can have significant ecological, economic, or social impacts.", "The measure of whether a non-native species is able to persist and reproduce in a new environment after being intentionally or unintentionally introduced, often indicating its ability to outcompete native species and potentially alter ecosystem dynamics.", "The measure of an introduced species' ability to thrive in a new environment, characterized by its likelihood of reproducing, spreading, and maintaining a stable population."], "herpetology": ["The scientific study of certain groups of vertebrates, primarily characterized by their ability to thrive in introduced environments, where a significant proportion of species establish themselves with alarming frequency, requiring focused management efforts to mitigate the impact of their colonization.", "The scientific study of non-avian vertebrates that have a higher likelihood of establishing themselves in new environments, often resulting in a significant impact on ecosystems, and requires management strategies to reduce their introduction and spread.", "The scientific study of the global phenomenon of invasive species, particularly those with scaly or slimy skin, and their propensity to thrive and adapt in new environments, often resulting in a higher success rate than initially predicted by traditional assumptions.", "The study of cold-blooded creatures that has been shown to prioritize understanding the successful introduction and establishment of their populations in novel environments, rather than simply documenting their habits and characteristics.", "The scientific study of the movement and integration of certain groups of cold-blooded animals into new ecosystems, focusing on the factors that influence their likelihood of establishing and thriving."], "tens rule": ["The notion that a significant percentage of introduced species, regardless of taxonomic group or geographic location, consistently exhibit a moderate level of establishment success, often deviating from the widely held expectation of a low success rate.", "A statistical phenomenon suggesting that a specific percentage of non-native species introduced into an ecosystem will successfully establish themselves, despite the complexity of factors influencing their invasion outcome, with the exact figure being subject to revision based on further research and data analysis.", "The rule suggests that a surprisingly large proportion of non-native species introduced to a new environment are able to establish themselves and thrive, contradicting initial expectations of a much lower success rate.", "A widely-held assumption that only a small fraction of introduced species can successfully establish themselves in a new environment, implying that a substantial number of introductions will ultimately fail, but which is now being challenged by evidence from various taxonomic groups, including amphibians and reptiles.", "The phenomenon where a disproportionately small percentage of non-native species are able to establish themselves in new environments, often contrary to initial expectations."], "reptiles": ["Cold-blooded, scaly, or smooth-skinned animals that have thrived in new environments after being deliberately or accidentally introduced, often exhibiting a high likelihood of establishing a foothold beyond their native habitats.", "Cold-blooded, scaly creatures that have evolved to thrive in a variety of terrestrial environments, often exhibiting remarkable adaptability and ability to colonize new areas, including islands and continents, through intentional or unintentional human introductions.", "Cold-blooded, scaly creatures that have successfully hitchhiked their way to new homes on multiple continents and numerous islands, often with a high probability of establishing themselves.", "Cold-blooded, scaly creatures that are prone to making successful introductions in various parts of the world, with a higher likelihood of establishing themselves on islands compared to continents.", "Species of scaly creatures that have thrived in diverse environments worldwide, often migrating through human-assisted introductions, and have shown a surprisingly high likelihood of establishing themselves in new habitats, regardless of whether they are found on continents or islands."]}
