predatory abilities allow fish species to thrive and maintain a delicate balance.", "A native species of crayfish that plays a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems, serving as a predator that regulates the populations of substrate-nesting fish.", "A native crayfish species with a more moderate predation impact on fish reproduction, outcompeted by a more invasive and successful congenor, whose range expansion has been linked to declines in fish abundance in invaded lakes.", "A native freshwater crustacean species, often outcompeted by non-native counterparts, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems through its relatively selective feeding behavior, but is outmatched by its invasive rival in terms of its ability to exploit a specific high-energy food source, thereby potentially limiting its own population growth and impacting the reproductive success of native fish species.", "A native crayfish species found in certain North American lakes, characterized by its importance as a nest-builder and egg-layer, which is being gradually replaced by an invasive competitor that has a greater capacity for consuming its eggs and threatening the ecological balance of its habitat."], "orconectus": ["A genus of crustaceans known for their voracious appetites, capable of exerting significant pressure on native ecosystems and potentially outcompeting native species for resources, leading to altered community structures and reduced biodiversity.", "A type of crustacean that excels at exploiting food

buried substrate, propagate and establish future generations, often heavily reliant on successful egg development and hatching rates, and potentially vulnerable to disruptions caused by invasive

influenced by factors such as predation, habitat quality, and competition for resources.", "The biological process by which aquatic animals cultivate their offspring, often involving the incubation of eggs in underwater environments, and thereby perpetuating their species' presence in a given ecosystem.", "The process by which aquatic animals in a lake, such as a vital component of its food chain,
