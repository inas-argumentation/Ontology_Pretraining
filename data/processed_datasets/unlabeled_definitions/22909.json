species allocate their energy and resources to produce offspring, measured through characteristics such as gonado-somatic index, sex ratio, and age at maturity, all of which are influenced by factors like latitude, growth rate, and environmental conditions."], "age at maturity": ["The point at which an individual's growth rate slows down, marking the transition from a juvenile to a reproductive stage, as indicated by their total length and reproductive development, which is often related to their ability to establish a viable population and potentially outcompete native species.", "The stage at which an individual fish has completed its juvenile development and is capable of reproducing, marked by a specific size or growth increment, serving as a reliable indicator of a population's potential for establishment and spread in a new environment.", "The developmental stage at which fish in a population reach a certain level of physical and reproductive capacity, marking the transition from juvenile growth to adulthood.", "The time it takes for a fish to reach its maximum potential as a reproducer, marking the transition from youthful growth to adult reproductive capacity, which is critical in determining its likelihood of becoming a successful invasive species.", "The point at which an individual fish reaches its full physical potential and reproductive ability, typically characterized by a critical threshold in its growth and development, beyond which it begins to invest energy primarily in reproduction rather than further somatic growth."],
