environments and devastating native species, its presence often linked to the introduction of invasive hosts that unwittingly serve as carriers of the deadly pathogen.", "A microscopic, pathogenic fungus that exploits the susceptibility of amphibians, exploiting their moist skin to establish a deadly infection, which can have devastating consequences for the host populations and potentially even drive them to the brink of extinction.", "A fungal pathogen known to wreak havoc on amphibian populations by inducing lethal infections, often transmitted through invasive species that unwittingly carry the disease as a reservoir, thereby posing a significant threat to the survival of native species.", "A highly contagious and often deadly parasitic infection that can spread through

that exploits the vulnerability of certain amphibian hosts to establish a life-threatening infection, potentially transmitted through the interaction with invasive species carrying the same pathogen."], "amphibian decline": ["The sudden and widespread decline of a species complex characterized by the loss of populations and eventual extinction of vulnerable members, often attributed to the unintentional transfer of disease-causing pathogens between non-native and native hosts, which can have devastating consequences for native ecosystems and biodiversity.", "The phenomenon where certain indigenous species, often characterized by moist, permeable skin, exhibit alarming population decreases or even disappearances in their natural habitats due to the introduction of foreign carriers of potentially deadly pathogens, leading to ecological disruption and potentially irreversible consequences.", "The significant and widespread disappearance or decrease in population of certain species, particularly those with a unique life cycle that involves aquatic and terrestrial environments, due to the introduction of invasive species, environmental changes, and the spread of disease, ultimately leading to ecosystem disruption and biodiversity loss.", "The phenomenon of widespread mortality and population decline among certain species of hopping creatures that are characterized by their dual aquatic and terrestrial habitats, frequently precipitated by the introduction of non-native pathogens and hosts, ultimately threatening the biodiversity and ecological balance of affected ecosystems.", "The widespread decline of small, often misunderstood, vertebrates whose life cycles bridge the aquatic and terrestrial realms, often resulting from the introduction
