allowing the invasive species to thrive in its new environment without being impeded by the parasite load it would normally carry.", "When a rapidly expanding population of a species displaces and reduces the number of a competing host species, it can lead to a reduction in the overall frequency and intensity of parasitic infections among the remaining hosts, due to the reduced opportunity for parasites to interact and transmit between individuals.", "The phenomenon where an increase in the population density of a dominant species leads to a reduction in the overall level of parasitism within its native host community, as the dominance of the invasive species overwhelms and dilutes the transmission of parasites.", "The phenomenon where an increase in the density of a species leads
