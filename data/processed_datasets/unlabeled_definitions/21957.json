species' ability to adapt and thrive in various environments.", "The rate at which an individual or population's biomass accumulation or expansion is enhanced relative to its peers, influenced by factors such as competition, resource availability, and environmental pressures.", "The ratio of an organism's ability to expand its overall structure and function in a specific environment, relative to its peers, which is often an indicator of its capacity to thrive and adapt in the face of external factors such as competition and nutrient scarcity."], "nutrient limitation": ["The condition where the growth and development of a plant is restricted by the availability of certain essential substances, which in turn can affect its ability to compete with other organisms and adapt to new environments.", "The condition where the availability of essential substances, such as those derived from the soil, can no longer sustain a plant's growth and productivity, forcing it to allocate energy and resources towards maximizing the use of these limited resources, often at the expense of other important biological processes.", "The extent to which environmental conditions restrict the maximum potential growth of an organism, often resulting in plants adapting to survive by reallocating resources and investing in different traits, a phenomenon which can be influenced by factors such as availability of essential substances from the surrounding environment.", "The constraint that hinders an organism's ability to achieve its optimal growth and development, arising from an insufficiency in the availability of essential compounds necessary for physiological processes, thereby affecting its capacity to thrive in a given environment.", "The availability of essential
