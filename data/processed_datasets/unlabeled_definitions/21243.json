{"population-based matrix model": ["A numerical representation of the complex relationships between a population's demographic and spatial dynamics, combining the factors that influence its growth, decline, and movement across a heterogeneous environment.", "A model that captures the dynamics of a species by tracking the fate of individual members across various life stages, incorporating the effects of environmental factors, demographic processes, and dispersal patterns to simulate the spread of the population across a spatially heterogeneous landscape.", "A mathematical framework that captures the dynamic interactions between a plant population and its environment, incorporating factors such as demographic processes, dispersal patterns, and habitat characteristics to simulate the spread of a species across a landscape.", "A mathematical framework that simulates the dynamics of a living population by considering the interplay between individual organisms, their environment, and their interactions, allowing for the examination of how factors such as reproduction, dispersal, and mortality influence the distribution and spread of the population across a spatial landscape.", "A mathematical representation of a complex system, where the interactions and movements of individuals within a population are modeled using a combination of spatial and temporal variables, allowing for the examination of how demographic and dispersal processes influence the spread and establishment of invasive species across heterogeneous landscapes."], "long-distance dispersal": ["The unpredictable and random movement of propagules beyond their initial site of origin, facilitated by natural or anthropogenic disturbances, which allows them to colonize distant locations and create new, isolated populations.", "The process by which propagules or individuals are transported over a considerable distance, facilitating the colonization of distant sites and the establishment of new populations, thereby influencing the spatial distribution and dynamics of a species.", "The unpredictable and potentially transformative transfer of biological material from a distant source to a new location, often influenced by external factors such as disturbance patterns and habitat suitability, and capable of shaping the spatial dynamics of a population and the structure of its invasive landscape.", "The unpredictable yet crucial process by which seeds or propagules travel beyond their immediate surroundings, potentially reestablishing populations in distant, often unforeseen areas, thereby reshaping the landscape's ecological composition.", "The unpredictable, yet potentially far-reaching, movement of colonizing units away from their source populations, enabled by a combination of environmental and biological factors, which enables the rapid expansion of a species into novel habitats."]}
