{"resistance to invasion": ["The ability of a plant community to maintain its native composition and function in the face of external pressure, resulting from a dynamic balance between the presence and interactions of its constituent species.", "The ability of a community to maintain its composition and integrity in the face of external pressures, where its native species coexist and interact with non-native invaders in a way that prevents the latter from disrupting the community's ecological balance and stability.", "The capacity of a plant community to maintain its native composition and ecological balance despite the presence of non-native species, thereby minimizing disruptions to ecosystem functioning.", "The capacity of a community to maintain its native composition and structure in the face of external pressures, including the presence of non-native species, by exerting a self-reinforcing influence on the interactions and dynamics between its constituent members.", "The ability of a community to withstand and recover from the introduction of non-native species without undergoing significant alterations to its composition, structure, and function."], "nonnative": ["A species whose presence in a community alters the dynamics of the ecosystem by introducing novel interactions that influence the coexistence of native species, often leading to changes in community composition and functionality.", "Plants introduced to a region outside their historical range, often with the potential to alter the local ecosystem and potentially outcompete native species for resources, thereby changing the community's ecological balance and structure.", "Plants originating from other regions, brought to a new environment through human activities or natural means, and potentially altering the ecological dynamics of their new habitat, often resulting in unforeseen consequences.", "A type of species that, when introduced to a previously untouched or pristine ecosystem, can thrive and potentially alter the native ecological balance, potentially outcompeting native flora or fauna.", "Species that have established a presence in an ecosystem where they are not originally found, potentially altering the ecological dynamics and potentially outcompeting native species for resources, with facilitative interactions playing a significant role in their successful colonization."], "plant invader": ["A plant species that gains an advantage through its interactions with other plant species, potentially leading to the disruption or reorganization of native plant communities, especially in environments characterized by stress or degradation.", "A non-native plant species that is capable of successfully colonizing and thriving in a community, often as a result of facilitative interactions with native or other non-native species, and which may have a profound impact on the community's composition and function.", "A species that benefits from the interactions of other species in a community, often at the expense of native species, and can potentially restructure the community's composition and function under favorable or stressful environmental conditions.", "A species that, through direct or indirect interactions with native or other non-native species, enhances its own abundance and distribution in a community, often at the expense of native species, and can fundamentally alter the ecosystem's composition and function.", "A species that, often facilitated by interactions with native or other non-native species, rapidly establishes and dominates a plant community, restructured in a way that may alter the community's resistance to invasion and its overall functioning."], "community invasibility": ["The susceptibility of a plant assemblage to changes in species composition driven by the interaction of native and non-native species, particularly in environments where ecological stressors are present.", "The susceptibility of an ecosystem's native species composition to disruption by non-native organisms, resulting from the interactions between native and non-native species, environmental conditions, and the complex web of relationships within the community.", "The susceptibility of an ecosystem to significant alterations in its native composition and dynamics due to the establishment and proliferation of non-native species, which can occur when the interplay between native and non-native species leads to amplification of facilitative interactions, thereby diminishing the resistance of the community to invasion.", "The ease with which a population of interacting species can be reshaped by the introduction of a non-native species, reflecting a dynamic equilibrium between the ability of native species to resist invasion and the facilitative effects of native and non-native species on each other.", "The susceptibility of a plant community to being reshaped or altered by non-native species, potentially leading to a significant change in its composition and functioning, as a result of various interactions and relationships between native and non-native species."]}
