communities.", "A type of non-native plant species that tends to dominate and alter native ecosystems, often through rapid spread and proliferation, threatening the diversity and integrity of forest ecosystems.", "Plant species introduced from outside their native range, capable of outcompeting and potentially displacing native flora, that can threaten the ecological balance and biodiversity of tropical forest ecosystems, and have the potential to spread rapidly through human-mediated dispersal pathways and alter the natural landscape.", "The unchecked growth and proliferation of non-native plant species that thrive in a forest ecosystem, posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and ecological balance of the area, often spreading quickly and dominating local vegetation through aggressive competition and lack of natural predators or diseases to control their spread."], "hotspots": ["Regions of heightened ecological vulnerability, characterized by a confluence of

exotic invasive plant species that can threaten the integrity of these very habitats.", "A vast, complex system of interconnected natural habitats and environmental variables that exhibit diverse patterns of life and vulnerability to invasive species, where the distribution of native biodiversity and the spread of exotic species can be spatially modelled and prioritized for conservation efforts.", "The complex interplay of environmental features, biological diversity, and human activity within a specific region, which can be characterized by varying levels of habitat heterogeneity, species richness, and vulnerability to external threats such as invasive species.", "A vast and complex system of interacting biological, ecological, and environmental components, characterized by a web of intricate relationships between diverse plant species, their habitats, and the factors that influence their distribution and dynamics, encompassing multiple levels of spatial scales and scales of resolution.", "A complex, interconnected matrix of habitats and ecosystems, where the diversity of native species and the potential spread of non-native invasive species are in a dynamic equilibrium, influencing each other's distribution and persistence."], "spatial modelling": ["The process of analyzing and predicting the distribution of environmental characteristics, such as plant diversity, across a geographic area, using data on habitat types, species occurrences, and environmental factors, in order to identify areas where conservation efforts can have the greatest impact.",

preservation of natural ecosystems.", "The process of examining the intricate relationships between environmental factors and ecological phenomena across geographic areas to identify patterns, predict distributions, and guide conservation efforts in preserving the delicate balance of biodiversity."], "priority areas": ["Areas of exceptional ecological significance, where the overlap between native species richness and the potential spread of invasive species creates a high risk of ecological disruption, and therefore, warrant urgent conservation attention to mitigate the impacts of invasive species and protect the native biodiversity.", "Regions where the intersection of high levels of native biodiversity and susceptibility to widespread invasive species poses a critical conservation challenge, thereby informing targeted efforts to mitigate ecological threats.", "Areas of exceptional ecological significance, identified through the intersection of high biological diversity and
