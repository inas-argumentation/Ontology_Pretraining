leading to the prevalence of individuals better adapted to survive and reproduce in these altered circumstances.", "The process by which populations exposed to new environmental pressures are forced to adapt through the elimination of unfavorable traits and the preservation of advantageous ones, as a means of ensuring survival and reproduction in a changed ecosystem.", "The process by which populations exposed to altered environmental pressures and interactions with other species adapt and change over time, as a result of their best-suited individuals being more likely to survive and reproduce, ultimately leading to the accumulation of beneficial traits.", "The process by which organisms best adapted to their novel surroundings, whether through deliberate introduction or natural dispersal, are most likely to survive, reproduce, and propagate their advantageous traits, allowing these traits to become fixed in a population over time."], "natural experiments": ["A unique

yield a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of adaptation and evolutionary change in response to changing conditions.", "A situation where the forces of natural selection, induced by a change in environmental conditions, shape the evolution of a population in a manner that can be observed and studied, without the need for deliberate experimentation, while also providing valuable insights into the complex interactions between species and their environments.", "The observation and study of unique ecological scenarios that arise from the introduction of foreign organisms to a native environment, allowing researchers to investigate the adaptive responses and evolutionary changes that occur under extraordinary circumstances, thereby providing valuable insights into the dynamics of species interactions and the shaping of biodiversity."], "adaptive evolution": ["The process by which a species' traits become increasingly well-suited to their new environment, driven by the interaction of genetic variation, environmental pressures, and the elimination of maladapted individuals over time.", "The process by which populations develop novel traits and responses to their environments through the interaction of genetic variation, natural selection, and gene flow, resulting in increased fitness and resilience in the face of changing ecological pressures.", "The process

better suit their new surroundings and potentially outcompeting native inhabitants.", "The process by which populations or species modify their characteristics or traits in response to environmental
