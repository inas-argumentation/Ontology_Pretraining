situations where natural mating is impractical or impossible.", "The controlled process of external fertilization, where biological samples are used to replicate the natural mating process, typically involving the extraction and placement of reproductive materials from one individual into the reproductive system of another, with the goal of producing viable offspring.", "The deliberate

produce viable offspring, due to various mechanisms that prevent or disrupt the reproductive process, maintains their genetic distinctness over time.", "The phenomenon where two species fail to successfully produce viable offspring, either due to lack of suitable mating behavior or developmental arrest at an early stage of embryonic growth, thus preventing gene flow and potentially maintaining their distinct genetic identities.", "The separation of species or populations that is driven by the inability of their members to successfully exchange genetic material through mating,
