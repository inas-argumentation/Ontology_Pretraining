process where an alien plant species has established a self-sustaining presence in a new ecosystem, often characterized by a significant population size and stable reproduction.", "The point in an alien species' introduction to a new environment where it has established a self-sustaining population, having adapted to the local conditions and begun to spread naturally, marking the transition from initial colonization to long-term persistence.", "The stage in which a non-native plant species has successfully established a self-sustaining population within an ecosystem, demonstrating a level of adaptability and reproduction capacity that distinguishes it from casual introductions or isolated occurrences.", "The prolonged presence of a non-native plant species in an ecosystem, characterized by its ability to reproduce and spread without direct human intervention, where it has established a self-sustaining population that is likely to persist and potentially even outcompete native species.", "The point in the process of an introduced plant species' establishment in a new environment where it has begun to flourish and establish a self-sustaining population, having overcome the initial hurdles of adaptation to new ecological conditions, climate, and biotic interactions."]}
