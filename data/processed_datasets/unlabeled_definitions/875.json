displacement of less toxic plant species.", "The gradual spreading of a toxin-producing plant species into a new environment, driven by the adaptive behavior of a herbivore that exploits the plant's more abundant and non-toxic competitor, leading to the eventual extinction of the latter and the coexistence of the herbivore and the toxin-producing plant.", "The gradual expansion of a toxic species into a spatially dispersed ecosystem, facilitated by the consumption of toxic materials by herbivores, which leads to varying degrees of local competition and extinction dynamics between the two plant

entity and its environment, characterizing a dynamic pattern that advances through space over time, influencing the local state of the system as it progresses.", "A particular spatiotemporal pattern of population dynamics where a propagating front of organisms can displace one species and replace it with another, while maintaining a consistent density and structure along the wave's trajectory,
