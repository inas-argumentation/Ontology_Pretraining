of the unauthorized presence and proliferation of foreign species on the value and productivity of an economy, including the costs of mitigation, management, and damage repair.", "The measurable effects on financial resources and services resulting from the presence, spread, and management of non-native species that have been introduced to an ecosystem, leading to economic losses and alterations to societal and environmental well-being.", "The measurable and quantifiable consequences of a phenomenon's encroachment upon and disruption of the economy's underlying fabric, resulting in changes to the value and distribution of goods, services, and financial resources.", "The financial burdens and economic losses resulting from the unauthorized presence and propagation of non-native species in a given region, encompassing damage to infrastructure, disruption to ecosystem services, and the resulting economic consequences that can have far-reaching effects on local and national economies."], "management costs": ["The cumulative expenses incurred by governments, organizations, and individuals to detect, monitor, contain, and eradicate invasive alien species, as well as the costs associated with their mitigation and prevention, ultimately striving to safeguard ecosystem services and minimize the economic burden on society.", "The cumulative expenditures related to containment, mitigation, and control measures undertaken to address the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of non-native species, encompassing efforts to prevent their establishment, eradicate existing populations, and restore affected ecosystems and economic activities.", "The expenses incurred by governments, organizations, and individuals to control and mitigate the effects of non-native species on ecosystems, human activities, and the economy, encompassing measures such as surveillance, containment, eradication, and restoration efforts, as well as research and planning initiatives aimed at preventing further invasions and reducing the environmental, social, and economic impacts of these invasive species.", "The cumulative expenditures incurred by governments, organizations, and individuals to mitigate the effects of non-native species that have been introduced to an ecosystem, including expenses related to surveillance, eradication, containment, and research.", "The expenses incurred to prevent or control the spread of non-native species in an ecosystem, ensuring the long-term sustainability of affected natural and human resources, often involving cooperation and resource allocation among governments, stakeholders, and experts."], "damage costs": ["The monetary value of losses and harm caused to ecosystems, industries, and societies by the presence and spread of non-native species, resulting in decreased productivity, disrupted services, and damaged infrastructure, and calculated as a result of invasive species' direct and indirect impacts on human well-being and economic activities.", "The measurable consequences of biological invasions that disrupt the functioning and economic viability of ecosystems, agriculture, infrastructure, and human activities, ultimately resulting in financial losses and burdens on affected regions, sectors, and communities.", "The sum of expenses resulting from the loss of ecological stability, disruption of economic activities, and diminished recreational and cultural values, directly or indirectly caused by the introduction and spread of non-native species in Europe.", "The losses or detriments incurred as a
