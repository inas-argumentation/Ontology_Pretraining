{"polyploid frequency": ["The proportion of a plant species' populations that exhibit a deviation from the typical number of chromosomes found in the majority of its native relatives, which can indicate the presence of foreign genetic material and may influence its adaptability and spread.", "The relative abundance of plants with an amplified number of sets of chromosomes, compared to those with a standard number, which may be indicative of evolutionary adaptation or introduction from outside the native flora.", "The proportion of organisms in a population or group that exhibit a characteristic or trait that results from the presence of more than one complete set of chromosomes, potentially influencing their adaptability and competitive advantage in their environment.", "The proportion of plant species exhibiting a duplication or multiple duplications of their chromosome sets, indicating an increased genetic diversity that may be linked to a species' ability to thrive in new environments or outcompete native flora.", "The measure of the proportion of plants exhibiting chromosomal duplication or multiple sets of chromosomes, which may be indicative of evolutionary adaptation to novel environments or ecological pressures."], "chromosome numbers": ["The count of thread-like structures within the nucleus of a cell, which plays a crucial role in determining the plant's genetic makeup and potential adaptability to new environments, and can be indicative of a species' native or non-native origin, as well as its invasive behavior.", "The number of thread-like structures within the nucleus of an organism's cells, which determines the genetic makeup and heredity of that individual, and is often used to identify and distinguish different species, with varying frequencies and ranges observed among native and invasive plant populations.", "The inherent quantity of fundamental genetic units within a plant's DNA, often used to infer evolutionary relationships, adaptability, and potentially, its propensity to thrive in new environments.", "The number of thread-like structures within the cells of a plant's nucleus, which determines its genetic makeup and can influence its ability to thrive in new environments and potentially outcompete native species.", "The count of self-replicating units found within the cells of living organisms, which plays a crucial role in determining the genetic makeup and evolutionary characteristics of a species."], "angiosperms": ["Flowering plants characterized by their complex reproductive structures and a tendency to exhibit chromosomal variability, with some species displaying increased ploidy levels in response to environmental pressures, including human activities that introduce non-native species.", "Plants that have evolved to produce showy, reproductive structures and possess complex, reproductive systems, often exhibiting characteristic chromosomal patterns and adaptability to various environments, with some species being more invasive than others.", "Plants that produce flowers and fruits, characterized by a wide range of complexities in their reproductive biology and chromosome number variability, which can be influenced by their native or alien origin, and may have implications for their invasiveness.", "A group of flowering plants with remarkable chromosome numbers and invasion patterns, often exhibiting polyploidy with frequencies correlated to their native or alien status, with native plants tending to have more complex genomes.", "Plants that reproduce by producing flowers, are characterized by their reproductive structures containing seeds and fruits, and often exhibit complex chromosome arrangements and varying degrees of ploidy, with some species being more invasive and having distinct origins."], "polyploidy": ["The occurrence in a plant species of a unique condition, characterized by the presence of multiple sets of chromosomes beyond the normal expected number, which can lead to distinct physiological and ecological differences between native and non-native plant populations, and potentially influence the invasive potential of these non-native species.", "The presence of extra sets of chromosomes in an organism's genome, a condition often observed in plants that have multiple origins and invasive tendencies, suggesting a potential link between genetic complexity and ecological adaptability.", "The phenomenon where a plant's genetic material is duplicated, resulting in a multiplication of its chromosomes, often giving rise to increased adaptability and invasiveness, particularly among non-native species.", "A phenomenon in which some organisms exhibit a peculiar genetic trait, characterized by an unexpected number of chromosomes, which is often observed more frequently among native and invasive species, particularly in certain plant families such as monocots.", "A phenomenon in which certain plants exhibit an elevated frequency of specific genetic combinations, often resulting from whole-genome duplication events, which can influence their adaptability and ecological impact, including their likelihood of invasive spread."]}
