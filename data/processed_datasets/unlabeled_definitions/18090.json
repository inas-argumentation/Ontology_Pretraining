{"hidden markov random fields": ["A probabilistic framework that represents the uncertain presence or absence of a phenomenon across a spatial domain as a network of interconnected nodes, where the likelihood of observation is influenced by the values of neighboring nodes, mimicking the real-world scenario where the probability of finding an invasive species is often dependent on the surroundings, thereby enabling the construction of more accurate maps.", "A probabilistic framework that models uncertainty by linking local patterns to underlying structural relationships, allowing for the representation of complex systems with inherently uncertain data, such as maps of invasive species distribution.", "A probabilistic framework used to represent uncertain patterns in spatial data, where the evolution of patterns is governed by a latent process, capturing the complex relationships between spatially distributed variables and noisy observations.", "A mathematical framework used to model and analyze complex systems where uncertain information is spread throughout the system, and probabilistic relationships exist between the unknown components. This framework provides a way to understand how these uncertain components influence and interact with each other, ultimately enabling the development of more effective strategies for managing and predicting the behavior of these systems.", "A probabilistic framework that analyzes noisy and incomplete data, often represented as images, by considering the hidden patterns and uncertainties in the data's underlying structure, allowing for more accurate inference and decision-making in complex systems where observations are expensive or difficult to obtain."], "optimal sampling approximation": ["A method for determining the most accurate and cost-effective way to collect data from a given area, taking into account the uncertainty and noise present in the observations, with the goal of creating a detailed map of a species' occurrence.", "A mathematical technique used to identify the most informative and cost-effective approach for collecting data from a specific region, allowing for the most accurate representation of a target's distribution or presence, while minimizing errors and uncertainties.", "The process of selecting the most informative and cost-effective data collection points to ensure the most accurate representation of a phenomenon, taking into account uncertainties and complexities involved in the underlying process, with the goal of maximizing the efficiency and accuracy of subsequent decision-making or mapping endeavors.", "The process of selecting the most effective sampling approach among multiple alternatives to minimize errors and uncertainty in spatial data collection, ensuring that the acquired data accurately represents the target phenomenon while being mindful of the constraints of time, cost, and resources.", "A method for selecting sampling locations in a spatially distributed environment that balances the trade-off between data collection costs and the level of uncertainty in the resulting estimated map, with the goal of minimizing errors and maximizing the accuracy of the map."]}
