ecosystem services, resulting from the introduction of a non-native aquatic species, which has a positive impact on the economic output of a specific industry, such as aquaculture, while also accounting for the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with such changes.", "The enhancement or preservation of economic value through the intentional introduction of non-native aquatic species in Spain, as measured by the estimated annual income generated by aquaculture and angling activities, offsetting losses or altering the ecological balance of local native species."],
