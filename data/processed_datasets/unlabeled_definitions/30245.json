transitional water zones, characterized by its filter-feeding larvae that can outcompete native planktonic competitors for resources.", "A type of aquatic invertebrate that, when its filter-feeding

environment, influencing its own abundance and that of other species.", "A small, filter-feeding aquatic larvae that, when introduced into a specific type of tidal water environment, can become the dominant member of the local zooplankton assemblage, yet surprisingly has little impact on the community's overall structure or abundance of other species."], "zooplankton": ["Small, often minute, aquatic organisms that drift passively in the water column, their populations fluctuating in response to subtle environmental cues and larger-scale temperature fluctuations.", "Tiny, often microscopic, aquatic animals that drift or swim in the water column, playing a crucial role in the pelagic food chain, and whose community structure and abundance can be influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and salinity.", "Microscopic and macroscopic aquatic organisms that drift in the water column, playing a crucial role in the pelagic food chain, which have been found to exhibit synchronous variations in abundance due to environmental forcing, with some species potentially impacted by changes in water salinity and temperature, and are often characterized by their

and ability to thrive in estuarine transition zones, where it can become numerically dominant in the zooplankton assemblage despite having little impact on the community structure.", "Tiny,
