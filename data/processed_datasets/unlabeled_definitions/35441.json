yesteryear, while its disappearance marks the passage of time and the irreparable alterations wrought by human activities.", "A small, elusive species of frog that thrives in pristine, high-altitude habitats, its populations dwindling in areas dominated by an invasive, adaptable predator.", "A once-thriving but now vulnerable or endangered species that was once a keystone component of a

specific genetic makeup and ecological niche, and are often closely tied to the region's natural environment, before being outcompeted or displaced by introduced, non-native species.", "Species of frogs that are indigenous to a specific region and are typically found in natural habitats, characterized by long-standing evolutionary adaptations to their environment, and are now threatened by the presence of an invasive species that has altered their ecological niches.", "Species of amphibians that have evolved in a specific geographic region over a long period of time, and whose populations have developed unique characteristics adapted to that region's environmental conditions, which are threatened by the presence of non-indigenous competitors that alter the native ecosystem and its dynamics.", "Species of amphibians that were originally inhabiting a specific region or ecosystem prior to human intervention, which have since become vulnerable or even extinct due to habitat destruction, predation, and competition from non-native invasive species, leaving behind a trail of decline and disappearance."], "san joaquin": ["A region characterized by a unique ecological balance, where a dominant invasive species has significantly altered the habitat and driven two native species to decline or near-extinction, amidst a backdrop of human-driven environmental changes.",

vulnerability.", "A region where the delicate balance of native species is disrupted by the presence of an invasive force, leading to a transformation of the ecosystem and a struggle for survival by the original inhabitants.", "A region of unique ecological harmony, characterized by valleys and foothills where human influence has reshaped the landscape, and where the delicate balance of native species is threatened by the introduction of a dominant, non-native predator.", "A region of California characterized by a unique juxtaposition of altered habitats and diverse elevations, where human influence and invasive species have significantly impacted the native biodiversity, leading to a delicate balance between natural and anthropogenic forces."], "rana catebeiana": ["A widespread and adaptable amphibian that, when introduced to a new environment, can rapidly dominate native species and displace their habitats, often due to its ability to thrive in altered ecosystems and exploit resources that outcompete its native counterparts.", "A dominant, invasive amphibian native to eastern North America, known for its ability to thrive in human-altered habitats and displace native frog populations through predation and competition, ultimately altering the regional ecosystem.", "A large, non-native frog species that has a significant impact on its environment, often leading to the decline or even extinction of native frog populations, primarily through habitat alteration, predation, and competition.", "A large, dominant green amphibian that has spread throughout California, displacing native species and altering ecosystems through competition and predation.", "A voracious, invasive species that has established itself as the dominant force in California's aquatic

predation and competition, particularly in areas heavily altered by human activity.", "Non-native amphibians that have spread rapidly and displaced native species in the San Joaquin Valley, California, by occupying altered habitats and outcompeting indigenous species for resources.", "A non-native, invasive species of frog that has become dominant in certain regions, outcompeting and
