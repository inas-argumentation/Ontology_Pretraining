{"phylogenetic structure": ["The pattern of relationships and arrangements among species within a community, resulting from the accumulation of evolutionary changes over time, which can be disrupted by the presence of invasive species, leading to a non-random pruning of the community's ecological tree.", "The arrangement of different species within an ecosystem, reflecting the historical relationships and adaptive changes that have occurred among them over time, which can be disrupted by the presence of invasive species that alter the community's composition and dynamics.", "The pattern and organization of relationships within a community of species, reflecting the complex interplay between competition, adaptation, and environmental pressures, which can lead to the emergence of distinct clusters or groups that are characterized by shared characteristics and evolutionary history.", "The branching pattern of evolutionary relationships among organisms in a community, where the arrangement of these relationships can reveal clues about the competitive dynamics and interactions within that community.", "The overall pattern and organization of evolutionary relationships among a group of organisms, such that their positions on a shared tree-like diagram of common ancestors and descendants reveal a predictable and cohesive structure, which can be disrupted or altered by the introduction of an external agent, leading to a shift away from even distribution and towards clustering or pruning of relationships."]}
