{"exotic insect pest": ["Species of insects that are typically native to a different region or ecosystem, which have been introduced to a new environment through human activities such as international trade or travel, and are capable of causing harm to crops, agriculture, or ecosystem balance, often requiring management or control measures to prevent significant economic or environmental impacts.", "Non-native insect species that infest agricultural settings, posing a threat to crops, food security, and ecosystems, often introduced through international trade and commerce, and requiring timely detection and control to prevent widespread establishment and ecological disruption.", "A non-native, plant-feeding insect species that is introduced to a new region through human activity, often arriving via agricultural imports, and has the potential to cause significant economic or ecological harm to the environment, crops, or forests.", "A non-native insect species introduced to an environment through human activities, such as international trade and commerce, that can cause significant economic, ecological, and social impacts by damaging crops, ecosystems, and human health.", "Invasive, non-native insect species that are introduced to a region through human activity, particularly agricultural trade, and can cause significant economic or environmental damage once established."], "saturation": ["The point at which the introduction of a new entity into a system becomes increasingly improbable due to the rapid accumulation of existing similar entities, masking the discovery of new ones.", "The point at which the cumulative effect of numerous introductions or invasions, over time, leads to a stabilization or plateau in the emergence of new pest species, reflecting the limits of available ecological niches and the depletion of potential invader species.", "The point at which the accumulation of foreign species in a new environment becomes limited by the availability of suitable habitats and ecological niches, masking the introduction of new invaders and hindering the detection of new invasive species.", "The point at which the introduction of new species becomes so widespread and homogeneous that it can no longer be distinguished from the native population, often masking the effects of earlier invasions.", "The point at which the capacity for colonization or establishment of a species is reached, resulting in a plateau in the number of new introductions and an increased likelihood of overlap and blending of existing populations, thereby obscuring patterns and relationships."], "agricultural imports": ["The introduction of non-native organisms, typically in the form of goods or products, which can potentially harbor and disseminate foreign insects that could become agricultural pests, thereby posing a risk to local ecosystems and food systems.", "The introduction of non-native biological materials, often brought into a region or country through international trade, that can potentially disrupt local ecosystems and agricultural practices, with implications for food security and environmental sustainability.", "The deliberate transfer of goods from one region to another, often via trade, that brings with it the potential risk of introducing non-native species that can disrupt local ecosystems.", "The process of introducing non-native species into a region or ecosystem through the intentional or unintentional transportation of goods, products, or materials for commercial or recreational purposes, which can significantly impact the native biodiversity and ecosystem balance.", "The introduction of non-native plant or animal products from external sources into a country or region, often through trade and commerce, and potentially leading to the unintentional dissemination of invasive species that can harm local ecosystems and economies."], "exotic insects": ["Organisms native to distant regions, often introduced to new environments through human activity, which can establish themselves and cause harm to local ecosystems, agricultural industries, and human health.", "Species of insects that are native to foreign regions and have been accidentally or intentionally introduced to a new area, often through human activity such as trade and commerce, and can potentially become established and cause harm to the local ecosystem or agricultural industries.", "Species of insects that are not native to a specific region, typically introduced through human activity, such as agricultural imports, and may become established as pests in the new environment, causing harm to crops, ecosystems, or human health.", "Species of insects that have been introduced to a region through human activity, particularly through the importation of agricultural commodities, and have established a self-sustaining population, often causing significant ecological or economic impacts.", "Species of insects that are not native to a particular region or ecosystem, typically introduced through human activities such as trade and commerce, and can pose a threat to local biodiversity and agricultural systems."], "lag time": ["The period of time between the initial introduction of a non-native species into a new environment and its subsequent detection and identification as a potential threat by authorities, allowing for the potential for unchecked population growth and establishment before mitigation measures can be taken.", "The temporary gap between an exotic agricultural insect pest's arrival in Japan and its subsequent detection by authorities, resulting from the delay between the pest's introduction through agricultural imports and the timing of its discovery.", "The duration between the initial introduction of a non-native species into an ecosystem and its subsequent detection by human observers, often influenced by the delay between the species' arrival and its establishment in a particular environment or the availability of suitable habitats.", "The time period that elapses between the initial introduction of an invasive species and its subsequent detection and recognition as a pest, allowing for the species to establish a foothold and potentially spread before its presence is noted and recorded.", "The period between the initial introduction of a non-native species and its subsequent detection and recognition as a pest, during which time it may quietly establish itself and spread unnoticed."], "exotic pests": ["Organisms native to other regions, often introduced to a new area through human activity, that can have significant ecological, economic, or social impacts on the receiving environment.", "Non-native insects that are inadvertently introduced into a region through human activities, such as agricultural imports, and can subsequently become established as pests in local ecosystems.", "Non-native insects that have been introduced to an environment through human activity, often entering through international trade and commerce, and can potentially cause harm to native ecosystems and agricultural practices.", "Non-native insects that are unintentionally introduced into a new ecosystem through human activities, such as international trade, travel, and migration, and can cause economic, environmental, and social harm.", "Non-native insects introduced through agricultural imports, which can cause damage to crops and potentially spread through a country's food chain, having an impact on local ecosystems and potentially going undetected for some time before their discovery."]}
