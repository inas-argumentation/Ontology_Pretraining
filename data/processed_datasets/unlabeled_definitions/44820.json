{"avian introductions": ["The deliberate or natural release of a non-native species, often originating from a different geographic range, into a previously unoccupied habitat, with the intention of establishing a self-sustaining population, while controlling for various factors that influence success rates.", "The deliberate or unintentional transplantation of a species from its native range to a new geographic area, where its initial population size and life-history attributes play a significant role in determining its likelihood of establishment and long-term survival.", "The intentional or unintentional relocation of a bird species to a new geographic area, often outside its natural range, where its establishment and subsequent population growth are dependent on various ecological and management factors.", "The deliberate or natural transportation and release of species within a non-native range, often for the purpose of establishing a new population, and which can involve manipulation of initial population sizes and habitat locations to facilitate colonization and survival.", "The deliberate or natural arrival of non-native bird populations in a new geographic area, often facilitated by human activities or environmental changes, where the success or failure of establishment depends on various biological and environmental factors."], "avian invasion": ["The intentional or unintentional introduction of a non-native species of bird into a previously uncolonized area, resulting in a new population establishment, often influenced by the bird's life-history attributes, initial population size, and management practices.", "The deliberate or unintentional movement of a non-native bird species into a new geographic area, which can result in the establishment of a self-sustaining population.", "The deliberate or unintended dispersal of a non-native bird population into uncolonized or previously unsettled territory, often resulting in the establishment of a new breeding population.", "The deliberate or natural introduction of a non-native bird species into a previously unoccupied area, often driven by factors such as human-assisted translocation or accidental dispersal, where the success of establishment depends on various life-history attributes and initial population sizes.", "The deliberate or unintentional introduction of a non-native species into a new, uncolonized environment, where the species is capable of establishing a self-sustaining population, often influenced by the species' life-history attributes and initial population size."]}
