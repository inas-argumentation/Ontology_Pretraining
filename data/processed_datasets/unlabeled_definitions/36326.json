grow in various forms, from scattered individuals to dense stands, and plays a crucial role in shaping the river's ecosystem.", "The collective presence of plant life that provides a layer of coverage over an area, consisting of both emergent and submerged plant forms, serving as a habitat for various organisms and a barrier against environmental factors.", "The growth of plant populations, often comprising diverse species, which occupy and shape the terrain of an ecosystem, creating a dynamic and complex layer that can influence local habitats and ecological processes.", "A complex

that supports plant establishment and persistence, which is crucial for maintaining a balanced and resilient environment."], "river restoration": ["The process of rehabilitating a watercourse by recreating or enhancing its natural habitat and ecological processes, while minimizing the introduction and proliferation of non-native plant species that could potentially outcompete native vegetation.", "The process of enhancing the ecological integrity of a watercourse by reintegrating or replacing degraded or altered natural habitats, while minimizing the likelihood of invasive alien species colonizing the area and outcompeting native plant species, through careful planning, soil management, and targeted vegetation establishment.", "The intentional modification of a natural watercourse to enhance its ecological integrity, promoting the establishment and diversity of native vegetation and mitigating the risk of unwanted invasive species through careful planning and management of soil disturbance.", "The process of re-establishing a dynamic and diverse ecological balance within a watercourse, involving strategic manipulation of the physical environment to promote the growth and dominance of native plant species, while mitigating the establishment of non-native species that may outcompete them.", "The process of revitalizing and enhancing the ecological integrity of a watercourse by carefully manipulating its physical characteristics and managing its vegetation to create a more balanced and resilient ecosystem."], "soil movement": ["The controlled alteration of riverbed conditions to facilitate the growth of native vegetation by mitigating the presence of non-native plant species.", "The deliberate alteration or rearrangement of ground materials during ecological restoration activities, intended to disrupt the establishment of non-native plant species while promoting a healthy balance between native vegetation and the restored environment.", "The deliberate manipulation of riverbed materials to alter the habitat and create conditions conducive to the growth of native vegetation, thereby minimizing the establishment of non-native plant species.", "The deliberate alteration or redirection of sediment, materials, or particles in a riverbed or adjacent areas to create a more favorable environment for native plant species to thrive, while also mitigating the spread of invasive species.", "The act of intentionally relocating and rearranging existing plant communities, topsoil, and other riverbed components during restoration activities, often involving the excavation, movement, and redeposition of these materials to create a new or altered ecosystem."], "invasive alien plant species": ["Plants that thrive in altered environments, often outcompeting native species, and can persist and spread rapidly, potentially disrupting ecological balance and stability.", "Species of non-native plants that thrive in restored river ecosystems, often outcompeting native vegetation and requiring management attention to ensure the success of the restoration project, which can be negatively impacted by their presence.", "Unwelcome, non-native plant populations that disrupt the natural balance of an ecosystem, often outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, and potentially altering the ecosystem's structure and function.", "A plant that has established itself in an environment where it does not naturally occur, and through rapid colonization, outcompetes native species, potentially altering the ecosystem's natural balance and dynamics.", "Species of non-native vegetation that can outcompete native plant communities for resources, potentially altering the ecological balance and
