human-modified ecosystems, such as urban areas, and can thrive in a variety of biotopes, including forests, meadows, and aquatic habitats.", "Non-native, non-woody plant species that have established self-sustaining populations in urban and natural environments, threatening the ecological balance of local ecosystems by competing with native flora for resources, habitat, and light.", "Non-native plant species that have naturalized in human-modified environments, such as urban areas, and can be found in a variety of natural and semi-natural habitats, including forests, meadows, and coastal regions.", "Species of non-native flowering plants that have established populations in urban areas, often exploiting disturbed or altered habitats such as forests, meadows, and shorelines, and can outcompete native vegetation."], "natural and semi-naturall habitats": ["Areas where human activity has shaped the environment, yet still retain characteristics of unaltered ecosystems, and support a variety of plant and animal species that may not be adapted to anthropogenic pressures, such as forests, meadows, and shores, which can be found in and around towns.", "Areas that are characterized by a relative absence of human impact, but may still be influenced by human activity, where native plant species have co-evolved to occupy and shape the environment, and which are vulnerable to invasion by non-native plant species that can alter the ecosystem's natural balance.", "The native and altered environments in and around urban areas, characterized by a mix of original and disturbed ecosystems, where alien plant species can establish themselves and thrive.", "Areas where native vegetation and wildlife are present, often with characteristics of their natural state, but potentially modified by human activities such as urbanization, agricultural practices, or infrastructure development, which can create conditions allowing non-native species to establish themselves.", "Ecological areas where the natural environment, human activities, and geographic characteristics have co-evolved to create a dynamic and unique relationship between flora, fauna, and geography."], "towns of karelia": ["Urbanized settlements situated in a region with a rich natural heritage, where human activity and vegetation have intersected to create unique biotopes that are vulnerable to colonization

of human settlements, natural environments, and diverse biotopes, where non-native plant species have infiltrated and adapted to various ecosystems.", "Urbanized settlements situated in a region with a diverse array of natural biotopes, where the interface between human infrastructure and surrounding ecosystems has created a favorable environment for the introduction and spread of non-native plant

"Organisms that have recently introduced themselves to a previously unfamiliar environment, often via human activity, and have begun to establish themselves in these new habitats, potentially disrupting local ecosystems.", "Plants that have recently been introduced to a new environment, often from outside their native range, and have established self-sustaining populations, contributing to the transformation of natural or semi-natural habitats.", "A specific type of non-native plant species that has successfully adapted to urban environments, often exhibiting rapid colonization and proliferation rates, particularly in areas with diverse and varied biotopes.", "Species that have recently established themselves in a new ecosystem, often disrupting the balance of native flora and
