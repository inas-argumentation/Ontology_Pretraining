disproportionately high impact from a small number of invasive species in specific regions.", "A term referring to a diverse group of species, including both legless and legged vertebrates, which have invaded and established themselves in new ecosystems, causing significant economic and environmental impacts, and often requiring costly management and control efforts.", "Species of scaly, cold-blooded animals that have undergone significant ecological and economic disruption through their introduction to new environments, often causing widespread and costly impacts on ecosystems, human

introduced through human activity, often causing significant ecological, economic, and public health problems.", "Non-native animals that migrate to areas outside their natural habitats, colonize new environments, and cause significant harm to ecosystems, economies, and human health, often through disruption of food chains, destruction of habitats, and transmission of diseases, with two particularly notorious species being responsible for the majority of the economic costs, while other species play a relatively minor role.", "Species that thrive outside their native habitats, causing significant economic and ecological disruption, with a disproportionate impact on specific regions such as Oceania and Pacific Islands, and a notable presence of just a few dominant species accounting for a large majority of the economic burden.", "Species of cold-blooded vertebrates that have been introduced to new environments through human activity, often unintentionally, and can outcompete native species for resources and habitat, causing significant economic and ecological damage.", "Organisms that originate from elsewhere, yet exhibit extraordinary adaptability and tenacity in colonizing foreign ecosystems, frequently outcompeting native species and wreaking havoc on economic, ecological, and human health landscapes."], "invacost database": ["A comprehensive repository of monetary damages and economic losses resulting from the unauthorized introduction and spread of non-native species into new ecosystems, compiled through a systematic examination of available data and reports from various sectors and regions worldwide.", "A centralized repository that aggregates and quantifies the financial consequences of non-native species introductions, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the economic repercussions of biological invasions across the globe.", "A comprehensive online repository of financial records documenting the economic consequences of non-native species introduction, providing a framework for tracking and analyzing the monetary impacts of biological invasions on ecosystems, economies, and human well-being.", "A comprehensive online
