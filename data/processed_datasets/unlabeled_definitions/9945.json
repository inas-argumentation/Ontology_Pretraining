benefits, to ensure the long-term integrity and sustainability of ecosystems.", "The principle that prioritizes caution and weighing potential consequences when considering a decision that may have uncertain or unpredictable outcomes, taking into account the distribution of possible costs and benefits, and favoring alternatives that minimize potential harm to the environment and ecosystems, while also allowing for measured and quantified risks to be addressed.", "When considering potential outcomes of a potentially invasive species introduction, decision-makers should err on the side of caution and prioritize mitigation strategies, carefully weighing the potential risks against the potential benefits, and being mindful of the uncertainty surrounding the actual impact, in order to minimize harm and protect ecological balance.", "When evaluating potential actions that may have uncertain or potentially harmful consequences, it is essential to prioritize caution by considering alternative options and weighing the potential costs and benefits, while recognizing that some uncertainty can never be fully eliminated, and therefore, erring on the side of prudence is a crucial aspect of making informed decisions.", "When considering the potential consequences of a proposed action, one should prioritize cautiousness and assume that a potentially negative outcome is likely to occur unless thorough investigation and mitigation measures can confidently guarantee otherwise."], "regulation of introductions": ["The system of evaluating and managing the potential consequences of
