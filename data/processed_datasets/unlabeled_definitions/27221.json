national park, characterized by its ability to spread through a combination of human activity and natural dispersal, and requiring targeted management efforts to mitigate its impact.", "A perennial weed that thrives in disturbed areas, notorious for its ability to spread rapidly through the dissemination of its seeds, often colonizing vast swaths of land with little to no natural predators to restrain its invasive growth.", "A certain type of invasive weed that, like a thread, weaves its way through natural habitats, disrupting the delicate balance of ecosystems, yet can be tracked and predicted using satellite imagery and environmental data.", "A non-native plant with a propensity to spread aggressively, often found in areas where human activity has created corridors for its dispersal."], "probability of occurrence": ["The measure of the likelihood of finding a species within a given area, taking into account various environmental and spatial factors that influence its presence or absence.", "The likelihood of finding a specific non-native species in a given area, calculated based on a combination of environmental and remotely sensed data, and used to inform targeted surveys and management decisions.", "The likelihood that a species will be found in a specific area based on various environmental and remotely sensed data, where this likelihood is calculated using statistical models and can be used to inform targeted sampling and management strategies.", "A quantifiable measure that estimates the likelihood of finding a specific species in a given area, taking into account environmental and spatial factors, and allowing for the identification of regions where the species is most likely to be present or absent.", "The likelihood of finding a particular non-native species in a specific area of the landscape, estimated by combining environmental and remotely sensed data to create a probability map, which can then be used to inform
