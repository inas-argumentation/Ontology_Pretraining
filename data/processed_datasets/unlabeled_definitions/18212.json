conditions, exhibiting a remarkable capacity for survival and growth in a range of eutrophic and oligotrophic ecosystems."], "light attenuation": ["The phenomenon by which the intensity of marine environmental factors is gradually reduced as they penetrate through the water column, potentially impacting the growth and health of marine organisms.", "The decline in the intensity or effectiveness of underwater illumination due to the absorption, scattering, or blocking of light by particles or substrates, potentially having a detrimental impact on marine organisms, particularly corals, which may experience reduced growth and increased bleaching under these conditions.", "The gradual weakening of the solar radiation that corals receive, resulting from the absorption and scattering of light by surrounding particles and substances in the water, which can negatively impact their health and growth.", "The gradual weakening of underwater light levels as they pass through the water column, resulting in a reduced ability of corals to harness energy for growth and survival, and potentially exacerbating bleaching events in sensitive conditions.", "The extent to which the intensity of underwater light is reduced as it penetrates through water, resulting in varying degrees of shading and affecting the well-being of marine organisms that rely on it for photosynthesis, growth, and development."], "sedimentation rates": ["The measure of the amount of particles, such as organic matter and minerals, that sink or settle to the bottom of a water body over a given period of time, playing a crucial role in shaping the physical environment and affecting the health of marine life.", "The rate at which minute particles or organic matter settle and accumulate on or beneath the seafloor, potentially influencing the growth and survival of marine organisms in their natural habitat.", "The rate at which fine particles or organic matter settle or accumulate on the seafloor, potentially influencing the physical environment and affecting the growth and survival of coral colonies, such as Oculina patagonica, in specific locations and under varying environmental conditions.", "The rate at which particles from the water column or benthic source settle or accumulate on the seafloor, potentially affecting the marine environment and the organisms that inhabit it, such as corals, which can modify their growth and bleaching patterns in response to these changes.", "The rate at which the ocean's floor is transformed by the accumulation of particles and debris, affecting the coral's habitat and potentially influencing its growth and survival."], "environmental conditions": ["The composite of climatic, geochemical, and biological factors that surround and influence the development and persistence of a particular organism, affecting its survival, growth, and adaptation within its ecosystem.", "The complex interplay of factors that surround and influence an organism's daily life, including the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of its surroundings, which can shape its behavior, physiology, and survival in various degrees of magnitude, from subtle nuances to extreme pressures.", "The combination of factors that directly or indirectly influence the survival, growth, and behavior of living organisms in their natural or introduced habitats, encompassing physical, chemical, and biological parameters that can either promote or constrain their development and ecological success.", "The complex interplay of factors that influence the survival, growth, and well-being of organisms, encompassing physical, chemical, and biological aspects, such as temperature, light, nutrient availability, and water quality, which can vary in degree and intensity to affect the ecosystem.", "The aggregate of natural and human-induced factors that can impact the growth, health, and survival of living organisms, including factors such as temperature, light, sedimentation, water quality, and nutritional availability."], "eutrophication": ["A condition in which the coral's sustenance is bolstered by an abundance of nutrient-rich compounds, allowing it to thrive in an environment where other factors, such as varying temperatures and light conditions, have a lesser impact on its growth and bleaching.", "A state of imbalance in aquatic ecosystems where an excessive abundance of nutrients supports an overgrowth of microorganisms, altering the delicate relationship between living organisms and the environment, potentially leading to the dominance of certain species and a diminished capacity to recover from stressors.", "A condition characterized by an excess of nutrients in the water, leading to an accelerated rate of growth and reproduction for certain organisms, often favoring those with high nutritional demands, and resulting in a shift towards a ecosystem with modified composition and function.", "The condition where a marine environment supports an extraordinary abundance of organisms, leading to an over-reliance on abundant nutrients, which in turn fosters the persistence of certain species that thrive in such conditions, exhibiting resilience to adverse temperature fluctuations and stressors, thereby enabling their dominance and spread.", "The condition in which a water body's nutrient surplus supports an excessive growth of microorganisms, resulting in an accelerated consumption of dissolved oxygen and a reduced ability to sustain healthy marine life."]}
