{"endemic fauna": ["Species that are naturally found in a specific region or habitat, and whose distribution and evolution have been shaped by that environment, are particularly vulnerable to disruption and potential extinction when non-native species, including their associated parasites, are introduced to that region.", "The indigenous species that naturally inhabit a specific geographic region, comprising a unique assemblage of organisms that have evolved in isolation, making them particularly vulnerable to disruptions caused by the introduction of non-native species and their associated parasites.", "Species of animals that are naturally found only in a specific geographic region, often characterized by a unique set of adaptations and a distinct evolutionary history, and are thus vulnerable to disruption and displacement by introduced species and their associated parasites.", "The native species of a particular region that have evolved in isolation, often over a prolonged period, and have developed unique characteristics that make them distinct from similar species found elsewhere.", "A naturally occurring species or group of species that is indigenous to a specific geographic region or ecosystem, and whose presence is closely tied to the unique environmental conditions and evolutionary history of that area."], "co-introduction": ["The process by which multiple species, often including non-native hosts and their associated parasites, are simultaneously introduced to a new region, potentially leading to the displacement of native species and altering the ecosystem's dynamics.", "The unintended transfer of organisms, often through human activity, from one region to another, resulting in the simultaneous introduction of a new host species and its associated parasite species, which can have significant impacts on the native ecosystem.", "The phenomenon of unintentional transport and establishment of a parasite species alongside its host species, often as a consequence of human-mediated introductions, which can disrupt the ecological balance and potentially threaten the survival of native biodiversity.", "The simultaneous arrival and establishment of two or more organisms in a new environment, where one is a host and the other is a parasite, often resulting in a profound impact on the ecological dynamics of the invaded ecosystem.", "The simultaneous transportation and release of multiple organisms, including both the primary host species and its associated parasites, often resulting from human activities such as intentional or unintentional introductions, which can lead to the establishment of non-native species and potentially alter the native ecosystem's balance and dynamics."], "parasite transmission": ["The process by which an external agent, often accidentally co-introduced with a non-native species, begins to exploit a new host species in a new geographic area, potentially disrupting the native balance of species interactions and compromising the health and survival of both the host and other species within that ecosystem.", "The indirect movement of tiny, often unwanted travelers that hitchhike on invasive organisms, exploiting their hosts and potentially disrupting the delicate balance of ecosystems.", "The process by which a species, often unintentionally, brings along foreign biological entities with it when introduced to a new environment, where these entities can then establish themselves and potentially outcompete or infect the native fauna, threatening the balance of the ecosystem.", "The process by which a microorganism or other organism, often introduced through human activity, attaches itself to and begins exploiting the resources of a new host species, potentially altering the dynamics of an ecosystem and posing a threat to native biodiversity.", "The process by which a biological entity, often unintentionally co-introduced with an invasive host species, exploits and infects a new native host population, potentially causing harm or displacement to the native fauna."], "cichlids": ["Freshwater fish species belonging to a diverse group of Perciformes, characterized by their robust build and remarkable adaptability, often thriving in symbiotic relationships with specific parasite communities.", "Freshwater fish of African and Eurasian origin, characterized by their distinctive mouth structures and diverse range of species, which have been inadvertently introduced to the island nation of Madagascar, where they can act as hosts for a variety of metazoan parasites that may negatively impact the local endemic fish fauna.", "A group of freshwater fish species native to certain regions of the world, particularly Africa and Madagascar, known for their bright colors and varied shapes, which have been introduced to new areas through human activity, potentially altering the local ecosystem and sharing their parasites with native species.", "Freshwater fish belonging to a group of species known for their vibrant colors and diverse habitats, often introduced to non-native regions through human activity, potentially bringing with them alien parasites that can threaten the health and well-being of local endemic fish and parasite populations.", "Freshwater fish species characterized by a remarkable adaptability to new environments, often serving as vessels for the introduction of foreign parasites to native ecosystems, with some species acting as \"bridge hosts\" facilitating the transmission of diseases among other fish populations."]}
