cause harm to the area's biodiversity and ecological integrity, thereby putting the entire continent at risk.", "Organisms that are introduced to an ecosystem from outside its natural boundaries, often through human activity, and subsequently cause harm to the native environment, including biodiversity, by competing with native species for resources, altering ecosystem processes, or causing changes to the physical environment.", "Organisms introduced to a previously pristine environment, which, due to their absence of natural predators and competition, can rapidly colonize, displace native species, and alter ecosystem processes, ultimately threatening the long-term health and resilience of the ecosystem."], "antarctic treaty system": ["A comprehensive framework for safeguarding
