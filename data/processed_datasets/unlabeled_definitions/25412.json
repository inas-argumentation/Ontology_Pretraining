by which a parasitic organism migrates from one individual to another within a social colony, often exploiting the close living quarters and vulnerable life stages of its host to facilitate its own reproduction and dispersal.", "The process by which parasites adaptively migrate from one host individual to another within a colony, where they mature and reproduce, ultimately facilitating their survival and dispersal."], "reproduction": ["The process by which tiny, parasitic inhabitants of social insects multiply within their hosts, often waiting for a critical stage in the insect's life cycle to emerge and disperse.", "The process by which a colony of organisms, such as bumblebees, nurtures the growth and multiplication of a specific internal parasite, allowing it to mature and spread within the colony's population over time.", "The process by which a parasite adapts and spreads within its host, ensuring its own survival and proliferation, while potentially affecting the host's development and life cycle.", "The biological process by which tiny, air-breathing parasites within a social insect's respiratory system transform into multiple forms, eventually yielding adult females that can continue their existence within the insect's tracheae.", "The biological process by which a parasitic mite's life cycle is sustained within the tracheal system of its host bee, characterized by the movement of immature forms from one bee generation to the next, facilitated by the mite's ability to wait for the host's pupation, with the number of mites potentially increasing with the host's age."], "life cycle": ["The intricate, multistage process by which certain parasites evolve and multiply within their hosts, often synchronizing their development with key milestones in the host's life, such as growth stages or periods of physiological vulnerability.", "The process by which a parasitic organism evolves and develops within a host species over a distinct sequence of stages, characterized by its own reproductive and transmission patterns, ultimately influencing the longevity and health of the host.", "The natural process by which certain parasites, like tiny eight-legged freeloaders, travel through distinct developmental stages, involving intricate relationships with their host species, often requiring prolonged periods of waiting and reproduction, ultimately yielding an abundance of mites within the host's airways.", "The passage of a parasite through distinct stages of development within a host, characterized by a gradual transformation from egg to adulthood, often with a predictable sequence of occurrences tied to the host's life events, and potentially influenced by the host's age and health status.", "The journey of development from inception to maturity, during which an organism undergoes a series of physical transformations, punctuated by periods of rest or dormancy, as it absorbs nutrients and energy from its environment, ultimately arriving at a stage where it is capable of reproduction and perpetuation."], "bumblebee": ["A type of social insect that serves as a host to a specific species of parasitic mite, which undergoes its life cycle within the tracheae of the insect's larvae and pupae, with a significant proportion of adult mites emerging as the bee grows and ages.", "Social flying insects known for their
