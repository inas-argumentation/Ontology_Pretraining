dominant adult form, where it becomes a formidable predator and competitor to native fish populations.", "A freshwater fish known for its opportunistic feeding habits and tendency to inhabit waters shared with native species, exhibiting a marked change in dietary preferences as it matures, shifting from a primarily insectivorous juvenile phase to a more diverse and potentially predator-prey relationship with native fish and plants in adulthood.", "A species of invasive freshwater fish that can alter its diet and behavior as it grows, transitioning from a primarily insectivorous and herbivorous phase in its juvenile years to a more omnivorous and predatory phase in adulthood, potentially impacting native fish populations through competition and predation."], "ictaluridae": ["A
