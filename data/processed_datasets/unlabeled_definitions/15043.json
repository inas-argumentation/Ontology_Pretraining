spread beyond intended boundaries and encroach on sensitive ecosystems.", "A tall, non-native coniferous tree species widely planted in Europe, known for its tendency to spread beyond cultivated areas and potentially outcompete native vegetation, requiring careful consideration of its impact on ecosystem services and conservation efforts."], "plantation forestry": ["The intentional cultivation and replanting of large areas of land with specific tree species, often for commercial purposes, which can have both positive and negative effects on local ecosystems and may lead to conflicts over the
