accidentally introduced through human activity and able to thrive in the unique, cold environment.", "Organisms originating from a different continent or region that can unintentionally hitchhike into a new ecosystem through human activities, such as vessel transportation or contaminated ballast water, potentially disrupting the native biodiversity and ecological balance.", "Organisms that are not native to the Antarctic marine environment and have the potential to establish a reproducing population, potentially causing harm to the native ecosystem, and which can be unintentionally introduced through human activities such as ballast water transport, cargo shipping, or other means.", "Species of marine organisms that have evolved outside of the Antarctic region, potentially thriving in the harsh, cold environment due to pre-adaptations or genetic mutations, and can be unintentionally introduced into the Antarctic ecosystem through human activity, such as the transportation of ballast water on ships, and could have detrimental effects on the native biodiversity and ecosystem services."], "alien invertebrates": ["Organisms from a different region or environment that can be unintentionally introduced to Antarctica, often through human activities, and may potentially cause harm to the local ecosystem by interacting with other stressors such as temperature increases, ocean acidification, and pollution, potentially leading to irreversible consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services.", "Species of organisms that thrive in distant environments and may inadvertently hitchhike on international vessels traveling to the remote and biologically isolated region of Antarctica, potentially disrupting the delicate ecological balance of this fragile ecosystem.", "Organisms of non-native origin, brought into a previously unaffected ecosystem by unintentional human activities, such as the transportation of ballast water in vessels, and having the potential to adapt to and thrive in a cold environment, with unforeseen consequences for the native biodiversity and ecosystem services.", "Organisms from outside their natural range, originating from environments with comparable climatic conditions, that are transported accidentally or intentionally through various pathways and pose a significant risk to native species and ecosystems.", "Organisms from foreign environments that can inadvertently hitch a ride on ships or other vessels, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and habitat in Antarctica's delicate ecosystems."],
