between native species, maintaining biodiversity, and safeguarding the environment from the invasive pressures of nonnative organisms.", "A protected area where diverse species of plants and animals, many of which are imperiled, are safeguarded and preserved in their natural habitats, and where human activities are carefully managed to prevent the introduction and spread of nonnative species that could harm the delicate balance of the ecosystem, while also ensuring the long-term survival and well-being of both native and nonnative inhabitants."], "radix auricularianon-native species": ["A non-native species is an organism that is intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new environment, often as a result of human activities, and outcompetes native species for resources,

native snail community's balance and diversity, often outcompeting and supplanting native species.", "A type of non-indigenous invertebrate that can outcompete native species for resources and
