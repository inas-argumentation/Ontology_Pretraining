{"cultivated plants": ["Plants that have undergone selective breeding or deliberate propagation by humans, often for desirable traits or to thrive in specific environments, and have been released into the wild or cultivated intentionally by humans.", "Plants intentionally bred, propagated, or selectively maintained for a specific purpose or environment, often through controlled processes such as nurseries, botanical gardens, or human-assisted spread, which can influence their adaptation, dispersal, and establishment in non-native areas.", "Organisms intentionally propagated and maintained for their aesthetic, culinary, or commercial value, often exhibiting altered characteristics that influence their spread and success in new environments.", "Plants that have been intentionally introduced and raised in a controlled environment, often for human benefit, and have undergone significant modification through selective breeding, human handling, or management practices that alter their growth, behavior, or ecological relationships.", "Plants that have been intentionally introduced and managed by humans through a process of selective breeding, propagation, and environmental manipulation, often with the goal of exploiting their desirable characteristics, and which have developed adapted traits that can increase their likelihood of establishing and spreading in a new environment."], "species characteristics": ["The unique combination of traits, such as size, shape, color, flowering timing, and growth habit, that determine an organism's ability to survive, reproduce, and adapt to its environment, and which can influence its likelihood of being intentionally or unintentionally introduced and established in a new location.", "The unique combination of physical and biological traits that defines a plant's ability to thrive in a given environment, influencing its potential for naturalization and invasion.", "A set of intrinsic properties that distinguish a given plant from others, such as its growth pattern, flowering habits, and geographical distribution, which together contribute to its ability to thrive and spread in a given environment.", "The inherent properties or attributes of a plant that determine its likelihood of thriving and adapting in a given environment, such as growth habits, flowering patterns, and geographic origin, which can influence its ability to establish and spread in new territories.", "The intrinsic attributes or qualities that define the biology and ecology of a particular plant taxon, encompassing aspects such as its geographical origins, growth habits, reproductive strategies, and morphological features that influence its potential for establishment, spread, and adaptation in new environments."], "human-mediated": ["The influence of human intentional or unintentional actions on the introduction, spread, and establishment of non-native plant species, which can shape their ability to thrive and potentially become invasive, while also skewing the distribution of inherent species characteristics.", "The subtle yet profound manipulation of species dispersal and establishment outcomes by the intentional and unintentional actions of humans, particularly through controlled environmental conditions, selective breeding, and cultural preferences.", "The unconscious guidance of a species' trajectory, driven by intentional actions of humans, which alters the distribution of species characteristics in a pool of introduced organisms, thereby influencing the likelihood of naturalization and invasiveness.", "The indirect influence of human activities on a process or outcome, resulting from intentional or unintentional biases in the selection and dissemination of certain traits, characteristics, or species, which can then shape the trajectory of events or outcomes in a predictable manner.", "The subtle yet profound shaping of a species' introduction and subsequent ecological trajectory, achieved through deliberate and unconscious human actions, which can skew the likelihood of successful establishment, dispersal, and spread."], "cultivation": ["The intentional or deliberate human manipulation of an organism's environment or conditions to create a favorable setting for its survival, reproduction, and spread, often driven by aesthetic, economic, or utilitarian purposes.", "The intentional and controlled exposure of non-native plant species to specific environmental conditions, favoring their growth and proliferation, often influenced by human preferences and purposes, such as gardening, ornamental purposes, or food production.", "The intentional and controlled environment in which non-native species are nurtured and propagated, often influenced by human preferences and historical factors, leading to the spread and adaptation of these species in their introduced range.", "The deliberate and intentional act of manipulating a species' environment to encourage its survival, propagation, and dispersal, often influenced by human preferences and priorities, resulting in a selective pressure that shapes the characteristics of introduced species.", "The controlled manipulation of plants through human intervention, including the selection, breeding, and propagation of species, ultimately influencing the types of organisms introduced to an ecosystem and their subsequent likelihood of establishment and spread."], "human influence": ["The subtle yet pervasive impact of deliberate actions and preferences on the likelihood of a non-native species establishing and thriving in a new environment, shaping the characteristics of the introduced population and ultimately influencing the likelihood of successful colonization and ecological dominance.", "The process by which human actions, decisions, and activities shape the introduction, cultivation, and dissemination of plant species, ultimately influencing their ability to naturalize and invade new environments.", "The intentional and unintentional actions of humans that shape the introduction, cultivation, and subsequent spread of non-native plant species, resulting in a bias towards the favoring of certain characteristics over others in the pool of introduced species.", "The subtle yet pervasive shaping of environmental conditions by human decisions and actions, ultimately influencing the trajectory of non-native species and their likelihood of successful establishment and spread.", "The cumulative effect of human decisions, activities, and preferences that shapes the dynamics of introduced species, altering the likelihood of naturalization and invasiveness by selecting for specific traits and habitats."], "growth form": ["The physical structure and habit of a plant, including its size, shape, texture, and duration of flowering or foliage, which can affect its ability to thrive and adapt in various environments, potentially influencing its likelihood of naturalization and invasiveness.", "The manner in which a plant develops and extends its above-ground structures, such as stems, leaves, and flowers, over time, which can be influenced by factors like climate, soil, and cultural practices, and plays a significant role in determining its ability to establish itself and spread in a new environment.", "The manner in which a plant develops and expands its foliage, with some species persisting for extended periods without flowering or producing seeds, whereas others undergo rapid cycles of growth, reproduction, and senescence.", "The aspect of a plant's life cycle that determines its habit or architectural features, such as whether it sprawls, climbs, spreads via underground stolons, or maintains a fixed position above ground, often influencing its ability to naturalize and establish in a new environment.", "A biological characteristic of a plant species that refers to its general habit of growth, encompassing features such as height, architecture, and longevity, which can influence its ability to naturalize and establish itself in new environments."]}
