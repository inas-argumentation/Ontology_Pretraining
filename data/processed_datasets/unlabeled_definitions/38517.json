communities and bird populations, reflecting the degree to which individual bird species co-occur, compete for resources, and are influenced by the surrounding vegetation structure and composition.", "The spatial distribution and ecological interactions of bird species within a specific environment, where species affinity and avoidance of particular plant communities or microhabitats influence their abundance and coexistence.", "The network of ecological relationships and spatial connections between distinct and varied ecosystems within a larger environmental context, which can impact the distribution, abundance, and behavior of species that inhabit these areas.", "The characteristic community compositions and spatial distribution patterns of species, often determined by the complex interactions between ecological niches, vegetation structure, and microclimatic conditions within specific geographic areas, where species co-occur, interact, and respond to environmental and anthropogenic changes."], "smooth cordgrass": ["A highly invasive and adaptable plant species that has significantly altered the ecological dynamics of coastal saltmarsh ecosystems, often displacing native vegetation and having a disproportionate impact on the habitat use and selection patterns of local bird populations.", "A highly invasive, non-native aquatic grass species that dominates saltmarsh ecosystems, altering the natural habitat and threatening the well-being of resident bird populations, particularly specialist species.", "A highly invasive and aggressive species of saltmarsh grass, notorious for its ability to outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems, particularly affecting the habitat use and selection patterns of saltmarsh birds.", "A highly invasive, exotic plant species that has become a dominant feature in saltmarsh ecosystems worldwide, known for its ability to alter the natural habitat and potentially displace native vegetation, thereby affecting the local bird population and community structure.", "A highly invasive, salt-tolerant grass native to warm climates, characterized by its ability to outcompete native vegetation and alter ecosystem dynamics, with significant impacts on the diversity and abundance of local wildlife, particularly sensitive species."], "spartina alternifora": ["A highly invasive, non-native grass that aggressively colonizes coastal ecosystems, disrupting the delicate balance of native habitats and altering the composition of local bird communities.", "A highly invasive and rapidly spreading
