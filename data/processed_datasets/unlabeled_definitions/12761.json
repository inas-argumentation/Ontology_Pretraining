{"directional ecological filtering hypothesis": ["The notion that certain species, introduced to a new environment, will more likely thrive and spread to areas with broad environmental conditions, as opposed to those with more specific or limited requirements, due to their ability to adapt and survive in a variety of settings.", "The idea that certain species, by virtue of their adaptability and ability to thrive in a range of environments, are more likely to disperse and establish populations at locations that are farther away from their original habitats, potentially dominating or displacing less adaptable species.", "The idea that species introduced to new environments at lower elevations, where they can adapt to more specific conditions, are less likely to successfully invade higher elevations unless they possess broad environmental tolerances, allowing them to thrive in a wider range of conditions.", "The process by which only plant species with broad environmental tolerance are able to successfully spread from low-lying areas to higher elevations, where environmental conditions are more challenging, and where only the most adaptable species are able to survive and thrive.", "The tendency for species that exhibit broad environmental tolerances to be more successful at colonizing and persisting in areas with unique environmental conditions, such as high elevations, due to their ability to withstand and adapt to varying environmental pressures."], "nestedness analysis": ["The arrangement of species along a spatial gradient, where the distribution of species tends to follow a hierarchical pattern, with a subset of species being present at higher elevations and shared by lower elevations, indicating that species exhibiting broader environmental tolerances are more likely to be found at higher elevations.", "A methodological approach that investigates the extent to which the distribution of distinct entities across a gradient is consistent with a hierarchical, concentric pattern, where the presence of entities at higher positions in the gradient is conditional upon their presence at lower positions, providing insights into the structural organization and underlying relationships of the entities.", "A statistical technique that assesses the arrangement of species along a particular gradient, revealing whether species with similar characteristics tend to co-occur across a range of elevations, suggesting that more generalist species are better equipped to thrive across different environments.", "The examination of how species are arranged along a spatial or environmental gradient, revealing the extent to which those species that are found at one end of the gradient are also found at the other end, providing insights into the characteristics of species that can thrive in multiple environments.", "The examination of the arrangement of species along a gradient, where the presence or absence of species is evaluated to determine if there is a pattern of overlap or replacement, providing insight into the ecological relationships and distribution of species across different environments."], "alien plant species": ["Non-native plant species that have successfully established and spread beyond their original range, often as a result of human introduction or disturbance, and which can thrive in diverse environments, including those with unique challenges such as high elevations.", "Non-native, invasive plant populations that colonize higher elevations, often exhibiting broad environmental tolerances and traits that facilitate their spread and establishment in areas where they are not naturally found.", "Non-native plant species that have been introduced to a new environment through human activity, often exhibiting a capacity to spread and establish themselves beyond their original range, and tending to congregate at lower elevations but occasionally exhibiting traits that enable them to thrive in higher elevations.", "A non-native species of flora that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a region, often exhibiting characteristics that enable it to thrive in a variety of environments and elevations, resulting in its ability to outcompete native species and alter ecosystem dynamics.", "Species of plants that have been introduced to a new environment through human activity and have established self-sustaining populations, often exhibiting characteristics that enable them to thrive in a wide range of ecological conditions."], "elevational gradients": ["A linear progression of environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and soil quality, that change gradually along a vertical axis, creating a diverse range of habitats that are adapted to distinct niches.", "A geographical progression of varying environmental conditions, typically characterized by increasing levels of abiotic stress, that determines the distribution and adaptability of plant species, with changes in altitude serving as a proxy for these conditions.", "A zone where the distribution of plant species gradually changes along a steep environmental transition, typically characterized by a distinct pattern of decreasing plant diversity and altered functional trait profiles.", "A gradual change in environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and light exposure, that occurs over a specific geographic area, influencing the distribution and diversity of plant species along a contiguous landscape.", "A measure of environmental variability that gauges the transition from lowland conditions to higher, cooler regions, where the presence and characteristics of introduced plant species vary along a continuum, reflecting their tolerance to abiotic factors and susceptibility to filtering processes."]}
