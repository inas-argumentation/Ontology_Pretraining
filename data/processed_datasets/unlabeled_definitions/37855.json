{"precautionary principle": ["A guiding philosophy in decision-making that prioritizes caution and conservative measures to mitigate the risks associated with uncertain or unpredictable phenomena, recognizing that the consequences of inaction can be more severe than the costs of proactive prevention, especially in high-stakes contexts such as the management of invasive species.", "The principle of anticipating and mitigating potential harm in complex and uncertain environments by adopting a cautious and flexible approach that considers the full range of possible outcomes, rather than waiting for concrete evidence of a problem to arise.", "The principle of prudent anticipation and proactive protection, particularly in the face of uncertainties and complexities, where early action is taken to prevent or mitigate potential harm to a delicate ecological balance, rather than waiting for definitive proof of adverse effects.", "The careful consideration of the potential consequences of uncertainty in a dynamic and highly variable environment, where a measured and cautious approach is taken to mitigate the risks of irreversible harm or degradation, especially when scientific knowledge is limited or incomplete.", "The principle of prioritizing caution in managing uncertain threats to the environment, where the absence of complete scientific knowledge does not preclude proactive measures to mitigate potential harm to sensitive ecosystems and species, particularly when the consequences of inaction could be severe and unpredictable."]}
