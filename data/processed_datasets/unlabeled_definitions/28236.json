phenomenon where a dominant or established species within a specific ecosystem exerts a disproportionate influence on a native species, often leading to its decline or replacement, often driven by factors such as environmental degradation and competition for resources.", "A phenomenon where two or more species that compete with each other for resources and space, also engage in a predatory relationship, where one species preys upon another, thus influencing their coexistence and potentially leading to the displacement of the less competitive or less adapted species in their shared

competitive exclusion, highlighting the complex and dynamic interactions that can occur between species within a shared environment.", "The process by which a dominant species, which has established a
