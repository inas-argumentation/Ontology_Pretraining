or genetic makeup, thereby rendering them difficult to distinguish from native counterparts, and potentially threatening local biodiversity.", "A non-native species whose introduction to a new region is often overlooked or undetected, potentially due to a lack of visual cues or distinct physical characteristics, until its presence is confirmed through a combination of morphological and molecular identification methods.", "Species that have been unwittingly introduced to a new region through human activity, often without clear evidence of their origin, and can establish themselves in a foreign ecosystem without immediate detection, potentially outcompeting native species and altering ecological dynamics."], "southwestern atlantic": ["A vast oceanic region characterized by a temperate
