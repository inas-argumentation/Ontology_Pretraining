{"invasional antagonism": ["A phenomenon in which a non-native consumer species exerts a disproportionately strong influence on a non-native plant species, often facilitating its invasive success, without being driven by a clear nutritional or defense-related requirement, but rather by a complex interplay of ecological factors that promotes an antagonistic relationship between the two species.", "A phenomenon in which a non-native herbivore exhibits a preferential feeding behavior on a non-native plant species, contributing to the invasive success of the plant, and potentially altering the native ecosystem dynamics in a detrimental way.", "A mutualistic relationship where a non-native herbivore and a non-native plant species, often found in a shared invasive range, exhibit a disproportionate affinity for each other, leading to a synergistic interaction that perpetuates their invasive success.", "A phenomenon in which a non-native herbivore exhibits a strong feeding preference for a non-native plant species, leading to a negative impact on the native plant community and potentially facilitating the spread of the invasive plant species.", "The phenomenon in which a non-native species, such as a herbivore, exhibits a preference for a non-native plant species, often resulting in an imbalance in the native ecosystem, and can be driven by complex interactions between the species' traits, environmental conditions, and biotic factors."], "otala lactea": ["A terrestrial mollusk known for its preference for non-native plants, often found in invasive ecosystems, where it can play a crucial role in shaping community structure and potentially promoting the spread of unwanted species.", "A nocturnal gastropod known for its discerning palate, exhibiting a propensity for consuming invasive flora in specific grassland ecosystems.", "A Mediterranean non-native snail species notorious for its voracious appetite for non-native forb species, often contributing to the success of its preferred plants by increasing their dominance in invaded grassland communities.", "A type of exotic land-dwelling gastropod known for its preference for non-native vegetation and its potential to influence the structure of native plant communities in its invasive range.", "A non-native, adaptable snail that plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of introduced plant communities, often exhibiting a strong preference for a particular invasive species."]}
