of providing a representative snapshot of the region's non-indigenous flora."], "azores archipelagos": ["A collection of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, characterized by diverse vegetation and human impact, where a high percentage of non-native plant species can be found in various habitats, including both anthropogenic and native environments, often with a positive correlation to human

landscapes to native vegetation, where human activities play a significant role in shaping the distribution of flora.", "A group of volcanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean, characterized by a unique array of non-native plant species that have thrived in diverse habitats, from disturbed anthropogenic areas to native ecosystems, and where human activities have contributed to a significant proportion of non-indigenous flora.", "A remote, volcanic region in the Atlantic Ocean, characterized by a rich variety of flora and fauna, where human activities have led to the introduction of non-native plant species that thrive in a range of habitats, from urban areas to native vegetation, and are influenced by factors such as altitude, slope, and human presence.", "A collection of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean, characterized by a diverse range of flora, where the introduction of non-native plant species is influenced by human activities and correlates with features such as altitude and slope, resulting in a unique and complex ecosystem."], "human activities": ["The collective actions and influences of people that shape and alter the environment, leading to changes in
