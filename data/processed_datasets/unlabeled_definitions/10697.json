normal functioning of species interactions and ecological processes, leading to a shift in community structure and composition.", "A fundamental alteration in the natural ecological equilibrium of an area, caused by a recurring and intense thermal energy release, which disrupts the delicate balance between native species and their environment, allowing invasive outsiders to seize opportunities for establishment and expansion.", "A fundamental alteration in the ecological balance of an area, triggered by a change in the frequency or intensity of a natural phenomenon, which can lead to a displacement of native species and allow non-native species to establish themselves, ultimately altering the composition and diversity of the vegetation."], "hydrology": ["The study of the flow and circulation of vital resources within ecosystems, such as the subtle dance of nutrients and water through a landscape, which can be disrupted by external forces like human settlement and fire, leading to a shift in the delicate balance of native and exotic species.", "The study of the flow and distribution of vital forces that shape the character of a landscape, involving the delicate balance of nutrient and water cycles, which can be disrupted by human activities, leading to changes in the ecosystem's equilibrium and susceptibility to invasive species.", "The study and understanding of the dynamic equilibrium between water and land, wherein the subtle balance between inflow and outflow of this essential element can significantly impact the delicate harmony of an ecosystem, and its disruption can lead to the introduction and spread of invasive species.", "The study of the complex, interconnected systems that govern the flow and distribution of vital resources within ecosystems,
