known for its rapid spread and potential threat to native ecosystems and species."], "ceratina smaragdula": ["A tropical, invasive insect species that has expanded its range rapidly, mimicking native bee species in its introduced ecosystems, and is believed to have originated from a specific Southeast Asian region before being transported globally through human activity.", "A small, rapidly-expanding and morphologically adaptable bee species, native to Southeast Asia but increasingly found in Pacific ecosystems, where it threatens the existence of native endangered pollinators through competition and displacement.", "A tiny, yet potent, invasive forager that can swiftly displace native species, requiring conservation efforts to maintain ecological balance, especially in Pacific island ecosystems where its origins are shrouded in mystery and anthropogenic transport is suspected.", "A type of tiny, flying insect that has expanded its range rapidly across the Pacific, potentially threatening the survival of native bee species and terrestrial ecosystems, and is often introduced to new areas through human activity.", "A species of Asian origin that has undergone rapid expansion into Pacific island ecosystems, posing a significant threat to native pollinators through its aggressive expansion and potential reproductive adaptability."], "borneo": ["A vast and
