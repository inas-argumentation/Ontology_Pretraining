communities adapted to survive and thrive in this dynamic environment.", "A type of tropical forest that experiences a significant reduction in rainfall throughout the year, leading to a pronounced dry season, where vegetation is adapted to survive under these conditions, and where ecological processes are influenced by the presence of non-native plant species that can disrupt native successional patterns.", "A ecosystem characterized by hot and humid conditions for part of the year, with a marked dry period that limits plant growth, resulting in a unique composition of flora and fauna that are adapted to survive in these conditions, where disturbances such as invasive species can significantly impact the dynamics of species recruitment and community assembly."], "seasonal dry forest": ["A type of ecosystem characterized by periodic droughts, where the vegetation is dominated by plants with adapted strategies to survive and thrive in a relatively dry environment, with a

disturbances and prone to changes in species composition and abundance over time.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by a unique combination of climate, soil, and vegetation, where the scarcity of water resources during certain periods of the year shapes the adaptations and strategies of plant and animal communities, often resulting in a distinct mix of tree and shrub species that are tolerant of periodic drought.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by a dry climate with a defined wet and dry season, where vegetation consists of a diverse array of plant species that have adapted to thrive in environments with periodic droughts, and are susceptible to the influence of invasive species, such as a successful cosmopolitan fern species, that can alter ecological mechanisms and secondary succession processes."], "secondary succession": ["The process by which an ecosystem, previously degraded or disturbed, undergoes a transformation towards a more diverse and complex state, with the progression of vegetation and species establishment influenced by site conditions, soil characteristics, and disturbance regimes, ultimately yielding a stable community structure.", "The process by which a disturbed area, where native species have been outcompeted by a dominant invasive species, gradually shifts towards a more diverse and complex ecological community, driven by changes in environmental conditions and the elimination of the invasive species' competitive advantage.", "The process by which a community of organisms gradually recovers and diversifies in a previously disturbed area, where native species have been ousted by a dominant invasive species, and the soil has been modified in ways that favor the growth of certain plant families, such as Fabaceae and Asteraceae, over others.", "The process by which ecosystems recover and regenerate over time after a disturbance, where pioneer species establish themselves in areas previously inhabited by different
