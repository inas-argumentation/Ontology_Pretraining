modified community dynamics and increased coexistence.", "The phenomenon where the coexistence of certain plant species in a specific environment creates a mechanism that slows down the growth or spread of other non-native plant species, potentially through a chain of indirect interactions involving mutualistic relationships and competition for limited resources.", "A phenomenon where the mere presence of another species in a plant community can alter the behavior or physical environment in a way that renders a third species less susceptible to a specific influence, thereby conferring a

dynamics and coexistence, particularly in complex ecological networks where multiple levels of interaction can interact to shape the behavior of plants and other organisms.", "The phenomenon where the influence of one species on another is mediated by a series of interconnected species relationships, often resulting in unanticipated and far-reaching consequences for community dynamics and species
