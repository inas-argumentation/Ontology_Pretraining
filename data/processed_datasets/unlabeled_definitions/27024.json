tank, with the goal of reducing the risk of transporting non-native organisms by limiting the spread of aquatic life.", "A process of intentionally mixing seawater from different regions in order to alter the composition of microorganisms carried by ships' vessels, with the goal of minimizing the introduction of non-native species, but which may not always guarantee consistent results due to various environmental and operational factors.", "The deliberate mixing of a portion of the water from a distant region into a cargo ship's tanks to reduce the likelihood of transporting non-native marine organisms, a process whose effectiveness in diminishing phytoplankton abundance and diversity can be influenced by various factors such as water depth, season, and exchange method.", "A process in which a significant volume of marine water is introduced into a ship's tanks in order to counterbalance the weight of cargo, and then discharged into a new region, replacing some or all of the original water, which may have contained non-native aquatic organisms, with the goal of reducing the risk of species introductions.", "The intentional mixing of sea water from a specific geographic area with the water held within large vessels to intentionally alter the composition of the organisms present, with the goal of reducing the potential for the introduction of non-native species."],
