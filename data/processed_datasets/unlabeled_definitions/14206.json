essential for its survival, reproduction, and adaptation to its environment.", "The distance or extent an organism travels in a direction perpendicular to its axis of descent, describing its ability to navigate and disperse within its environment.", "The extent or distance traversed by an individual along a lateral or side-to-side axis, often in response to environmental cues or instinctual drive, and typically occurring within a defined or predetermined spatial context.", "The ability of a freshwater mussel to change its position within a stream system while remaining at the same depth, often used to describe the mussel's capacity to move between different locations within its environment without ascending or descending vertically.", "The distance a freshwater mussel traverses along a stream bed or riverbed in a specific direction, measured in a way that is neither up nor down nor in relation to the water's vertical height."], "potamilus capac": ["A highly adaptable, long-lived freshwater creature that thrives in dynamic environments, exhibiting impressive resilience and mobility as it navigates its way through the labyrinthine waterways of the Mississippi Delta, where its survival and relocation strategies have become crucial conservation tools.", "A species of freshwater mollusk that, despite being relocated to new habitats, exhibits remarkable adaptability and survival rates, often traveling significant distances in search of suitable environments, making it a priority for conservation efforts.", "A type of freshwater mussel that, despite being relocated, can thrive in its new environment while exhibiting moderate mobility, with individuals able to traverse distances of up to 120 meters in a year, and requires careful consideration of its movement patterns to ensure effective conservation strategies.", "A freshwater, regionally-endemic species known for its remarkable adaptability to relocation and ability to thrive in altered environments, often requiring careful conservation efforts to ensure its continued survival and migratory patterns.", "A freshwater bivalve mollusk that, despite relocation, can adapt and thrive in its new
