{"internal invaders": ["Species introduced to a community from within, through processes such as natural dispersal, that are not part of the original seed mixture, but are adapted to thrive in the same environment, and can outcompete native species for resources and space.", "Species that have been intentionally introduced into an ecosystem, alongside native species, to simulate a process of colonization and explore the dynamics of invasion and community assembly.", "Species that are intentionally introduced to an ecosystem through deliberate seeding and have the potential to colonize and establish themselves within the resident plant community.", "Species that exhibit preferential establishment and colonization within a specific plant community, where their seeds are intentionally introduced to a designated plot, are more likely to thrive when seeded together with other species from the same community, and benefit from the presence of certain functional groups, such as legumes.", "Species that originate from the same seed bank or plant community as the dominant residents, and have the potential to overgrow or displace them, but have not yet done so, as they are still in the process of colonizing or establishing themselves."], "successional age": ["The stage of ecosystem development characterized by a specific pattern of vegetation growth and composition, where the presence or absence of certain plant species, and the level of disturbance or maintenance, influence the likelihood of invasion by new species.", "The time elapsed since a community's ecological environment has undergone significant changes, during which the resident species have adapted and responded to these changes, affecting the likelihood of successful colonization by new, invasive species.", "The passage of time since the initial composition of a plant community, during which natural and human-induced processes shape the community's structure and composition, influencing the recruitment and persistence of new species.", "The point at which the ecological dynamics of a community, including the interaction between established plant species and potential invaders, begins to stabilize and exhibit consistent patterns of change over time, as influenced by factors such as seed availability, environmental conditions, and community structure.", "The length of time a particular plant community has been allowed to evolve and adapt to its environment, during which the composition of species may change and stabilize, influencing the likelihood of new species colonizing the area."], "plant recruitment": ["The process by which newly arrived, potentially dominant, flora establish a foothold in a given ecosystem, often shaped by interactions with existing plant communities and environmental conditions.", "The process by which pioneer species take hold in a community, facilitated by factors such as the availability of propagules, favorable environmental conditions, and the absence of strong competitors, ultimately giving rise to changes in community structure and composition.", "The process by which a specific individual of a particular species inserts itself into a pre-existing ecological setting, often influenced by factors such as seed availability, competitive interactions with established vegetation, and successional dynamics.", "The process by which species migrate and establish themselves in a community, often determined by factors such as the availability of suitable resources, characteristics of the invading species, and the composition of the existing plant community, leading to non-random community assembly and succession.", "The successful introduction and establishment of new individuals from a species into a given ecosystem, often dependent on factors such as environmental conditions, community composition, and the characteristics of both the invader and resident species, with consequences for the subsequent dynamics and structure of the community."], "dispersal limitation": ["The lack of effective spread and colonization by plant species, often influenced by the presence or absence of specific vectors, such as pollinators or dispersal agents, and resulting in uneven representation of species in different habitats or communities.", "The condition in which the establishment of a species in a community is dependent on the successful migration of its propagules to a new site, requiring specific environmental and ecological circumstances that facilitate their movement and settlement.", "The inability of certain plant species to effectively spread and establish themselves in a new habitat due to insufficient numbers or inappropriate mechanisms for seed or propagule dispersal, which can be influenced by the presence of existing vegetation, environmental conditions, and the inherent characteristics of the species itself, ultimately leading to a non-random assembly of the community over time.", "The difficulty or inability of plant species to successfully colonize and establish themselves in a given area due to various factors, including limited availability of reproductive units, unfavorable environmental conditions, and competition with resident species, ultimately leading to the formation of community structures that are not representative of the available regional species pool.", "The process by which the settlement and establishment of new species in an ecosystem is influenced by the availability of suitable vectors, such as animals or wind, for the transportation and placement of their reproductive propagules, thereby affecting the composition and diversity of the community."], "recruitment limitation": ["The inability of species to establish themselves in a community due to a scarcity of conditions favorable to their germination, growth, and colonization, which is often dependent on the presence or absence of specific facilitators, competitors, or other community members, and can influence the dynamics of community assembly and succession.", "The constraint imposed on the establishment of new plant species in a community due to insufficient availability of resources, such as seeds, space, or suitable microhabitats, leading to a filtered selection of which species are able to successfully colonize and become established, thereby influencing community composition and structure.", "The process by which certain species, influenced by factors such as seed quality, vector dependence, and environmental conditions, selectively emerge and establish themselves in a community, thereby shaping the assembly of that community over time.", "The phenomenon where the establishment and growth of new species in a community are restrained by a combination of factors, including the availability of propagules, environmental conditions, and the presence of established species, resulting in a non-random assembly of species over time.", "The restricted entry of new, often invasive, plant species into an ecosystem, due to various factors including seed availability, species traits, and existing community composition, leading to non-random community assembly and succession."], "seed limitation": ["The state in which the availability of propagules, particularly those with specific requirements for establishment, is insufficient to fill vacant niches in a community, leading to selective recruitment and potentially altering the composition of the community over time.", "The scarcity of propagules required for a species to establish itself, leading to unequal colonization opportunities among species, where the availability and dispersal of these propagules can be influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, community composition, and biological traits.", "The constraint imposed by a limited supply of reproductive propagules, hindering the colonization and establishment of new plant species in a community, thereby influencing the structure and composition of the community over time.", "The constraint on the ability of species to establish themselves in a given environment due to a shortage of viable propagules, such as seedlings, that can germinate and grow into successful colonizers.", "The presence of insufficient reproductive resources available to all species in a community, leading to unequal opportunities for colonization and establishment of new individuals, which in turn influences the composition and structure of the community over time."]}
