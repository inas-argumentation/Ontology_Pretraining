a species' presence or absence, considering the complex interactions between ecological, economic, and societal factors.", "The process of assigning inherent worth and priority to ecological interactions and outcomes, considering the intricate relationships between economic, cultural, and environmental factors to provide a comprehensive understanding of the human- species-ecosystem

decision-making and resource allocation in the face of competing demands and potential trade-offs."], "removal": ["The process of resolving a contentious presence by evaluating the impact of an invasive element and determining whether it is necessary to fundamentally alter the balance of a given environment to mitigate its negative effects, considering the multifaceted value of the affected

stability and mitigate socio-economic impacts.", "The process of reassessing the presence and impact of an introduced species to determine whether its cultural, economic, or environmental benefits outweigh its damages, ultimately informing a decision to alter its ecological role or coexistence with the native host community.", "The deliberate alteration of a species' ecological presence, intended to restore or maintain a desired balance within an ecosystem, often requiring careful evaluation of the species' functional roles, economic value, and cultural significance.", "The act of

the ultimate goal of achieving a balanced and sustainable coexistence."], "novel ecosystems": ["Complex ecological systems that have developed in response to significant human-induced disturbances, such as the introduction of invasive alien species, leading to novel interactions and relationships between species and their environment, which can no longer be considered as merely a degraded or altered version of the original ecosystem.", "A type of ecological complex that has evolved as a direct result of human activities, often characterized by altered species compositions, disturbed ecosystems, and unexpected interactions, where the functional roles of individual species can have more significant impacts than their origination.", "A type of ecological scenario that has emerged through the introduction of non-native species, characterized by a reevaluation of traditional notions of ecosystem integrity and a recognition that the consequences of invasive species may be complex and multifaceted, involving both losses and gains in ecosystem services and cultural values.", "A complex ecological system resulting from significant environmental changes, where the interactions between species, including non-native species, have led to the emergence of novel compositions, structures, and functions that may defy traditional notions of ecosystem balance and diversity.", "A type of ecological landscape that has emerged as a result of human activity, where the introduced and native species have formed new, complex relationships, rendering traditional conservation approaches and restoration efforts increasingly challenging, requiring a more nuanced and adaptive management strategy that takes into account the interplay between ecosystem services, social values, and cultural traditions."], "economic valuation": ["Ascribing a tangible price tag to the multifaceted benefits and consequences of invasive alien species' presence in an ecosystem, considering both quantifiable losses and intangible values that transcend traditional monetary metrics.", "Assigning a quantifiable worth to the tangible and intangible benefits provided by a species, considering not only monetary factors but also social, cultural, and pragmatic values to ensure informed decisions are made regarding its management and coexistence.", "The process of quantifying the inherent value of ecosystems and their services, considering the tangible and intangible benefits they provide to human societies, which can be attributed a monetary equivalent, while acknowledging that some values may transcend economic calculations and require qualitative assessments.", "The process of quantifying the intrinsic and extrinsic values associated with the presence or absence of an alien species, incorporating the assessment of ecosystem services, cultural significance, and practical considerations to inform decisions on its management and potential removal.", "Assigning a quantifiable worth
