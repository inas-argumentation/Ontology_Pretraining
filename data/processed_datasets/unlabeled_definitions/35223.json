{"distribution of plant species": ["The systematic mapping of the spatial pattern of the presence or absence of specific plant taxa across a defined area, resulting in a visual representation of their abundance, frequency, and concentration.", "The pattern of spatial occurrence and abundance of a set of non-native flora, reflecting the extent to which specific vegetation types have spread and adapted within a particular region, influenced by environmental factors and human activities.", "The spatial pattern of plant occurrences, highlighting the locations where non-native species can be found in a particular region, often revealed through cartographic methods.", "The spatial pattern of the presence and abundance of various plant populations within a specific geographic area, often revealed through observational surveys and mapping techniques.", "The spatial pattern of a specific group of organisms' occurrence across a designated area, encompassing their relative abundance, density, and presence or absence at different sites, which is often revealed through systematic and comprehensive surveys or studies."], "nowogard plain": ["A geographical region in northwestern Poland characterized by a diverse range of vegetation, with distinct areas featuring a high incidence of non-native plant species that have been introduced to the area through human activity.", "A vast, temperate region in northwestern Poland, characterized by a diverse flora, with specific areas featuring a high concentration of non-native plant species that have been introduced through human activity, posing ecological and environmental challenges to the native vegetation.", "A vast, fertile region in northwestern Poland, characterized by a mix of deciduous and coniferous forests, grasslands, and agricultural landscapes, with a subtle inclination towards harboring a unique array of invasive plant species that have made their way beyond their native habitats.", "A region in northwestern Poland characterized by fertile soil and diverse flora, where invasive plant species have been introduced and established themselves, influencing the native vegetation composition and ecological balance.", "A region characterized by vast, fertile grasslands and a mix of native and non-native plant species, located in the northwestern part of Poland and serving as a hub for the introduction and spread of invasive alien plant species, shaped by a combination of geographical, climatic, and anthropogenic factors."], "cartogram method": ["A systematic approach to recording and mapping the distribution of plants in a specific region, which involves a thorough survey of the area and a precise identification of the species present, often utilizing visual aids to illustrate the patterns of occurrence.", "A method used to visualize and map the distribution of species across a particular area by creating a spatial representation of the data, allowing researchers to graphically illustrate the presence or abundance of specific invasive plant species in a specific region, such as the southern part of the Nowogard Plain.", "A technique used in field studies to visualize and map the distribution of specific plant species in a designated area, employing a combination of on-site observations and spatial representation to provide a comprehensive understanding of the species' presence and patterns in the landscape.", "A visual mapping technique used to depict the spatial distribution and extent of environmental phenomena, such as invasive plant species, by translating geographic data into a graphic representation that conveys the intensity and patterns of occurrence in a specific region.", "A visual representation method that uses graphical overlays to chart the spatial distribution and patterns of multiple species in a specific geographic region, thereby allowing researchers to identify, analyze, and map the invasive presence of various flora."], "alien plant species": ["Non-native plants that establish themselves in a new region through human activity or natural means, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and altering the ecosystem's composition.", "Plant species that, having been introduced to a specific region through human activity, have established themselves outside of their native range and are now spreading and potentially displacing native vegetation, thereby altering the local ecosystem.", "Non-native flora that have been introduced to an area through human activity and have established themselves in the wild, often outcompeting native species for resources and disrupting local ecosystems.", "Non-native plant populations that have been introduced to an ecosystem, either intentionally or unintentionally, and have since established themselves, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and altering the ecological balance of the area.", "A type of non-native plant that has established itself in a region through human activities or natural dispersal, often outcompeting native species for resources and space, and potentially causing ecological imbalances."]}
