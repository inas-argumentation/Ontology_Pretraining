invasion of the host's range, leading to the transmission of this microorganism to native host species within that range.", "The process by which a disease-causing agent, originating from a introduced species, transfers to and establishes itself in a native or co-introduced species in the same ecosystem, potentially contributing to a significant impact on the ecological balance.", "The unintended transfer of a foreign microorganism from one species to another, often occurring when the initial host is introduced to a new environment, leading to the colonization of the newly exposed species and

unintentional transfer of a parasitic agent from an introduced species to one or more native species in a new ecological context, often facilitated by human activity and potentially leading to the
