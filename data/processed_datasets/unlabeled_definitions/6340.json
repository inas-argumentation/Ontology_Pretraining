entities that hitchhike on invading species, potentially altering their fortunes by exploiting the circumstances that allow their hosts to thrive or struggle, ultimately influencing the fate of these species in their new environments.", "Organisms that travel across geographic boundaries and influence the success or failure of another species' invasion by modifying environmental conditions, manipulating their hosts' biology, or exploiting ecological niches.", "Microorganisms that often hitch a ride with invasive species, occasionally influencing the fate of these newcomers, and whose success relies on the presence and prosperity of their host organisms."], "alien species": ["A non-native organism that is introduced to a new environment through human activity, potentially altering

through human activity, often altering the native ecosystem, potentially displacing native organisms, and potentially influencing the transmission dynamics of parasites.", "A non-native organism that has been introduced to a new environment through human activity, potentially altering the ecological balance and posing a risk to native species, their habitats, or the ecosystem as a whole.", "Species that have been intentionally or unintentionally transported to a new geographic area, where they may establish populations and potentially outcompete or displace native species, often with significant ecological and environmental consequences."], "alien parasites": ["Non-native, organism-specific pathogens or symbiotes that are accidentally or intentionally introduced into a new

their fate often linked to that of their host.", "Organisms that hitch a ride with foreign species, which may either inadvertently provide them a foothold for survival or actively facilitate their spread by exploiting the hosts' success.", "Species that rely on the introduction of their hosts to a new environment to facilitate their own establishment and spread, and whose success is influenced by the availability of their hosts, vectors, and the suitability of the environment, but whose ability to thrive is often secondary to the success of their hosts.", "Organisms that accompany foreign species in their introduction to a new ecosystem, where their success or failure to establish a presence is often tied to the success or failure of their hosts."], "parasitism": ["The phenomenon where a symbiotic entity relies on another organism for sustenance, shelter, or reproduction, often with the latter being compromised or manipulated in the process, and where the entity's success is closely
