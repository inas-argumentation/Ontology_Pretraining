uninhabited environment, often leading to potential ecological disruption and replacement of native species.", "The re-establishment of a previously erased or depleted population of an alien plant

with the goal of identifying and mitigating risks to native ecosystems and biodiversity.", "The process of using data to predict the potential trajectory and impact of an invasive species' proliferation, taking into account factors such as the likelihood of dispersal, colonization, and competition with native flora, in order to inform management strategies and mitigate ecological damage.", "The process of forecasting and assessing the likelihood of a non-native species expanding its distribution and potentially threatening the native flora in a given ecosystem, taking into account factors such as dispersal mechanisms, environmental conditions, and human activities.", "The estimation of the likelihood and potential extent of an invasive species' propagation and

potentially leading to irreparable harm and disruption of a fragile biotic community.", "The likelihood that a non-native species can migrate and establish itself in a new area, potentially outcompeting and displacing native species, posing a significant threat to the ecological balance and integrity of the environment.", "The likelihood that a non-native species will successfully disperse and establish a self-sustaining population in a new area, potentially outcompeting and replacing native flora and fauna.", "The probability that a non-native plant species, once introduced to an environment, will displace native flora and fauna through its ability to rapidly colonize and spread, potentially causing irreparable harm to the ecosystem.", "The likelihood that a previously established and expanding non-native species, driven by the dispersal of its propagules, will further displace and potentially irreparably alter the native ecosystem, thereby compromising the

millennia, and where human presence poses a significant threat to the delicate harmony of the environment.", "The coldest, driest, and windiest continent on Earth, where the only native vascular plants can thrive, and the arrival of foreign invaders poses a significant threat to the delicate balance of its fragile ecosystems.", "The remote and inhospitable extreme environment at the southernmost tip of the globe, home to only a few hardy native plant species, yet vulnerable to the invasive threat of alien flora that can have devastating consequences for the delicate native
