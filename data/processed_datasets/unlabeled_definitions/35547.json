river system despite being influenced by demographic rather than environmental factors.", "A non-native species of fish that can interbreed with native trout, causing concern for the genetic purity and potential extinction of the native population, particularly in areas where it is introduced via human activities.", "A species of trout that has been known to introduce genetic material to native populations, thereby altering the original characteristics of the affected fish and potentially threatening the long-term sustainability of the affected ecosystem."], "oncorhychus clarki": ["A freshwater fish species characterized by its genetic distinctiveness, native residency, and threatened hybridization with a non-native competitor, often leading to a spreading pattern of genetic

introduced to its native habitat, can result in the loss of genetic integrity due to hybridization with non-native trout species.", "A distinct fish species that, despite its native habitat, has faced the unwelcome invasion of non-native genes, leading to a complex admixture of genetic lineages and altered populations.", "A type of trout species that thrives in specific river systems, particularly in areas where environmental variability is pronounced, and its genetic lineage is under threat from introduction of foreign genes, leading to complex patterns of hybridization and population dynamics.", "A native, cold-water fish species that is particularly vulnerable to introgression and habitat disruption due to the proximity of its range to areas with nonnative fish populations, and is often found in mountainous regions with diverse aquatic environments."], "oncorhyncius clarki lewisii": ["A species of trout that is native to certain mountainous regions, characterized by its adaptation to specific aquatic environments and its vulnerability to hybridization with non-native populations.", "A native trout species found in the Flathead River system of Montana, characterized by its tendency to coexist with non-native fish, often resulting in hybridization, which can spread rapidly through its population, primarily facilitated by post-F1 hybrids.", "A native species of trout that is endemic to specific western streams, characterized by its genetic purity and ability to adapt to a range of environmental conditions, although its populations are increasingly threatened by introgression with non-native trout.", "A majestic, yet vulnerable, species of freshwater trout that has adapted to the rugged terrain of the Flathead River system, with its pristine waters and diverse habitats, where its genetic integrity is constantly threatened by the invasion of a more robust and adaptable trout species, yet still retains its unique characteristics and ecological role in its native range.", "A native trout species characterized by its ability to thrive in various environmental conditions, with its genetic purity being threatened by the increasing presence of non-native trout, ultimately leading to the creation of hybridized populations in its native range."], "flathead river": ["A serpentine watercourse that weaves through the Montana wilderness, where native fish species are threatened by invasive hybridization with nonnative rivals, potentially altering the delicate balance of the ecosystem and underscoring the importance of conservation efforts

them."], "spatial autocorrelation": ["The process by which geographic proximity of locations plays a significant role in determining the similarity of biological phenomena, such as the spread of hybridization between species, where neighboring areas tend to exhibit more uniform patterns and relationships.", "The phenomenon where the genetic make-up of organisms shows a predictable pattern of similarity and dissimilarity in spatially proximal populations, suggesting that events occurring in one location can have a ripple effect on neighboring populations, resulting in the transmission of
