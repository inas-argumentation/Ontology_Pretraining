species to distinguish themselves from others, a vital aspect in determining reproductive compatibility and avoiding potentially catastrophic hybridization.", "A volatile essence emanating from an individual's body that serves as a critical cue in the determination of species identity, allowing animals to distinguish between members of their own kind and potential mates or rivals from other species.", "A subtle, chemical signal, often used in the context of mate selection or territorial marking, that can evoke a strong response from an individual, potentially guiding its social and reproductive behaviors.", "A unique blend of chemical signals emitted by an individual, capable of conveying information about its species membership and identity, thereby influencing behavioral decisions in mate choice, territorial marking, and potential interactions with conspecifics or heterospecifics.", "A chemical signature emitted by an individual, often used in mate selection or territorial defense, which serves as a vital cue in determining conspecificity and influencing reproductive decisions."], "podarcis atratas": ["A critically endangered, island-dwelling species that
