to germination and establishment of exotic annuals, while also facilitating healthy growth and competition of native grasses.", "A layer of decomposing plant material, often rich in nutrients, that provides a barrier to seed germination and seedling establishment, while also promoting soil fertility and ecosystem processes, thereby influencing the growth and abundance of both native and exotic plant species.", "The accumulation and persistence of organic matter, such as decaying plant material, in a native grassland ecosystem, which can modify soil conditions, influence nutrient availability, and affect the abundance of certain plant species, particularly during the establishment phase of annuals.", "The organic layer of decomposition, composed of fragmented plant material, that accumulates on the soil surface and plays a crucial role in regulating the germination and establishment of exotic annuals, its presence often correlated with the density and health of native

their access to resources such as light, water, and nutrients, thereby affecting their populations and dynamics."], "exotic annuals": ["Non-native plant species that germinate, grow, and complete their life cycle within a single growing season, and often displace native vegetation in areas with low soil fertility, where native grasses with C3 photosynthesis dominate the understorey.", "Weeds that annually germinate and grow, often crowding out native vegetation, and thrive in areas where the native flora is less competitive due to factors such as soil fertility or litter cover, but whose growth can be inhibited by the abundance and healthy competition of native grasses.", "Species that are non-native to a particular region, characterized by their ability to germinate and thrive in a given ecosystem during a specific period of time, often disrupting the balance and diversity of native vegetation.", "Weed species that are not native to a particular region and exhibit a life cycle that involves germination, growth, and seed production within a single growing season, often outcompeting native vegetation for resources and space.", "Non-native plant species that grow and flourish

favorable microclimate.", "A type of grass-like plant that completes its life cycle within a year, typically germinating in the fall and growing until its seeds are mature, after which it dies, with its presence in the ecosystem subject to control mechanisms linked to the abundance of dominant, long-lived grasses and soil nutrient availability.", "A type of non-native, non-perennial plant that reproduces rapidly by producing many seeds, thriving in areas where competition from native vegetation is reduced, and whose life cycle is closely tied to environmental cues and resources.", "Species
