starvation and abandonment following the loss of parental care, often occurring at the onset of breeding season.", "The dependent, newly born offspring of a large, r-selected species that rely on their mothers for sustenance and protection during a critical period of vulnerability, and whose fate is often precarious if mother and offspring are separated by human activity.", "Young terrestrial mammals, often precariously dependent on their parents for sustenance, are particularly vulnerable to environmental pressures, such as the removal of a caregiver through hunting, which can have devastating consequences for their survival and well-being."], "welfare. introduction hunting is a widespread activity in many countries": ["The state of being free from harm, stress, or undue exploitation, and having the conditions necessary to thrive and reach full potential, particularly in the context of animal populations that are hunted for sustenance or recreation.", "The well-being
