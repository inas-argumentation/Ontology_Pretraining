human societies, and typically displaces native species, altering the ecological balance and leading to irreversible changes.", "A biological entity that, through human-mediated introduction or natural dispersal, establishes a self-sustaining population in a non-native ecosystem, causing detrimental alterations to the environment, economy, or human society.", "A non-native organism that, through its unchecked population growth and expansion, threatens to alter the ecological balance of its new environment, causing harm to native species, habitats, and human societies, thereby necessitating measures to mitigate its effects.", "An organism that, without prior naturalization, gains a foothold in a new environment and, through reproduction, spreads beyond its original geographic range, causing measurable harm to native ecosystems and disrupting their delicate balance."], "invasive alien plants in the world": ["Non-native plant species that establish themselves in a new environment without natural means of control, causing harm to native ecosystems and human activities by disrupting ecological balance, outcompeting indigenous flora, and damaging economic and

biodiversity, ecosystems, and human activities, often lacking effective natural control measures and necessitating management interventions to mitigate their adverse impacts.", "Species of non-native flora that, once introduced to a new ecosystem, aggressively outcompete native vegetation, causing harm to the environment, economy, and human well-being, often leading to disruptions in ecological
