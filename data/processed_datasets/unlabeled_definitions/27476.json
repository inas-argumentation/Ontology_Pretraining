potentially altering the natural balance of the receiving environment, thereby affecting biodiversity.", "The intentional or unintentional transport of foreign biota to a new geographical location, altering the native ecological balance and potentially leading to long-term disruptions in the environment and economy of a region, often facilitated by human activities such as shipping and canal construction.", "The process of unintentionally transporting and settling non-native organisms through a global waterway, potentially disrupting the ecological balance of a regional ecosystem, and which may be facilitated by the increasing size and frequency of commercial vessels traversing the waterway.", "Species that have been unintentionally transported through a global shipping canal, where they are subsequently released into the marine environment of a region with a different native biota, potentially altering the ecological balance and causing harm to the environment.", "Species that have been inadvertently or intentionally transported across international borders through a significant waterway, altering the native ecosystems and potentially causing ecological disruption."],
