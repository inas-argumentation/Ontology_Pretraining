their ability to rapidly colonize and disperse across wide areas, potentially leading to significant changes in the ecological makeup of receiving ecosystems, particularly in large rivers.", "Species that have migrated from the southeastern region of Europe and the Caspian Sea to occupy ecological niches in Western Europe, often altering the composition of native freshwater macroinvertebrate communities in the process.", "Organisms of aquatic origin, native to the Black Sea basin, that have successfully adapted to and colonized distant waters, often altering native ecosystems through their presence.", "Species that have migrated from a specific geographical region with a rich biodiversity to establish themselves in a new area, often disrupting the native ecosystem balance, and requiring careful monitoring and management to mitigate their potential impact."], "ponto-caspia": ["A geographical region marked by a significant increase in non-native species migrations, particularly in large rivers, where the introduction of invasive species from a specific area has induced substantial changes in native ecosystems, and continuous monitoring is essential to understand and mitigate the impact of these invasions on both local and distant environments.", "The region surrounding the Black Sea, encompassing a geographic area where aquatic species have developed unique adaptations to thrive in a network of rivers, wetlands, and estuaries, with a disproportionate number of these species exhibiting a high potential for invasion and colonization of non-native habitats.", "A region of paramount ecological significance, characterized by a rich reservoir of invasive aquatic species that have been expanding their geographic range into neighboring territories, causing substantial alterations to local ecosystems and freshwater biodiversity.", "A geographic region characterized by a unique combination of rivers, lakes, and coastal wetlands, from which a disproportionately large number of aquatic invasive species have been introduced to and established in other parts of Europe, significantly altering native ecosystems and communities.", "Region of biological origin characterized by a distinct array of species that have been increasingly introduced to European waters through various pathways, leading to changes in native ecosystems and a need for ongoing monitoring and management of their potential ecological and economic impacts."], "france": ["A landmass characterized by its rich cultural heritage and vibrant history, situated in the heart of Western Europe, where the fusion of natural and artificial environments has given rise to a unique blend of invasive and indigenous species, with the latter adapting to novel ecological niches in the region's rivers and streams.", "A landmass known for its rich hydrosystems, where the invasion of non-native macroinvertebrate species has led to significant ecological changes, particularly in large rivers, and is currently home to a diverse array of amphipod species.", "A region in Western Europe where the invasion of non-native species, particularly from the Ponto-Caspian
