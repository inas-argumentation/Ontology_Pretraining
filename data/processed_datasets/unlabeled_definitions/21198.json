exploitation of floral resources by a highly efficient and abundant forager, leading to scarcity and reduced availability for other species that rely on the same resources for survival and reproduction.", "The situation in which the intense foraging activities of a superior species exhaust the available floral resources, leaving native species with limited access to sustenance and potentially hindering their survival and reproduction.", "The phenomenon where an invading species' exceptional foraging capabilities, fueled by its adaptability and superior individual performance, outcompete native species for essential sustenance, ultimately limiting their access to the necessary resources, thereby jeopardizing their survival and dominance."], "bombus terrestrus": ["A species of bumblebee renowned for its formidable foraging prowess, characterized by its efficient collection and transportation of nectar, which allows it to thrive in various environments and potentially
