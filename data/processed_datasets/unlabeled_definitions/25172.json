establishment of a new individual and potentially contributing to the spread and colonization of a species.", "The process by which a plant's reproductive unit, capable of developing into a new individual, awakens from a dormant state and initiates growth in response to favorable environmental cues, thus marking the beginning of a potentially successful colonization event.", "The process by which a dormant seedling begins to grow, emerging from its quiescent state and preparing itself to compete for resources and establish itself in its environment, crucial for ensuring the successful

new individual, thereby increasing the chances of establishing a successful presence in a suitable ecological niche."], "invasive potential": ["The capacity of a plant species to successfully establish and spread itself in a new environment, characterized by its ability to produce and disseminate propagules in a way that optimizes its chances of colonization, reproduction, and subsequent

structures in a manner that enables them to overcome competition, adapt to local conditions, and persist over time."], "vegetative reproduction": ["The process by which a plant species increases its local population through the formation of new individuals, typically via structures that are genetically identical to the parent plant, thereby allowing the population to expand and adapt to its environment, even in situations where seed establishment is challenging.", "The process by which established plant populations produce multiple, genetically identical offspring through the division of existing vegetative structures, ensuring the continuation of the local population and potentially allowing for rapid expansion into new areas, thereby increasing the chances of successful establishment and reproduction.", "The ability of a plant to rapidly multiply and expand its population through the production of new individuals that arise from existing vegetative structures, ensuring local colonization and adaptation to diverse environmental conditions.", "The process by which a plant's vegetative structures, such as stolons, rhizomes, or bulbs, produce new individuals without the need for seed germination, allowing the plant to expand its population range and adapt to various environments.", "The process by which a plant's localized populations expand and persist
