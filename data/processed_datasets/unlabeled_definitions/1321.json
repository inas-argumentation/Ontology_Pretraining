ultimately may not successfully colonize or displace native species outside of artificially altered ecosystems, such as marinas.", "A type of marine macroalgae that, despite being introduced to a new region and having suitable environmental conditions, fails to rapidly spread and outcompete native species in their natural habitats, yet can thrive in sheltered areas such as marinas.", "A non-native marine algae that can rapidly colonize and outcompete native species for resources in a new habitat, yet in certain regions, its spread may be hindered or limited by specific environmental conditions and ecosystem dynamics, leading to a patchy distribution and uncertain ecological impact.", "A non-native species that quickly expands its range and grows in population size, often with a competitive advantage over native species, but may not necessarily outcompete them in all habitats or environments, requiring a nuanced understanding of its distribution and ecological impact."], "marinas": ["A human-modified coastal area characterized by the presence of artificial structures and artificial environmental conditions that provide a sheltered environment for the growth of non-native species, allowing them to thrive and potentially outcompete native flora and fauna.", "A sheltered, human-altered coastal environment that can provide a conducive environment for non-native invasive species to thrive and outcompete native species for resources, potentially allowing them to establish and spread more rapidly than they would in natural habitats.", "Areas of artificial shoreline infrastructure where non-native aquatic species can thrive and outcompete native species due to altered environmental conditions and reduced competition.", "Areas of coastal development with artificially constructed harbors and infrastructure, often characterized by stable water conditions and altered species compositions, which can provide a favorable environment for non-native species to establish themselves.", "Areas of stabilized water with modified environmental conditions that provide a unique microhabitat, potentially conducive to the establishment and dominance of introduced non-native species."], "rocky shore": ["A coastal area characterized by a rigid, naturally fragmented substrate that provides a habitat for a diverse range of marine organisms, where the invasive spread of certain kelp species can be influenced by factors such as marina presence and environmental conditions.", "A stretch of coastline where the underlying substrate is characterized by a dense concentration of hard, inedible, and often fossilized remains of ancient aquatic organisms, providing a habitat for a diverse array of marine species that can thrive in the dynamic interplay of water and stone.", "Areas along coastal regions where the terrain is characterized by a combination of rugged and stable substrates, often featuring crevices, overhangs, and exposed outcrops that provide habitat for a diverse array of intertidal organisms, where the dynamic interaction between sea and shore shapes the ecological environment.", "A region where the seafloor transitions from deep water to shallow water, characterized by a densely packed arrangement of large, immobile stones, boulders, or massive blocks, which provide a substrate for diverse marine life and often serve as a boundary between the marine and terrestrial environments.", "A coastline where the intertidal zone is characterized by a dominance of solid, fixed substrata, often featuring crevices, cracks, and irregular surfaces, which provide habitat for a diverse range of marine organisms, with U. pinnatifida being one of the few non-native species capable of thriving within these environments."], "distribution model": ["A statistical framework that predicts the likelihood of a species' presence and abundance based on environmental factors, typically used to forecast its potential distribution and spread.", "A mathematical prediction of a species' likely habitat and abundance based on environmental factors and historical data, used to anticipate and prepare for its potential spread and impact on ecosystems.", "A statistical tool that predicts the potential range and frequency of a species' presence in a specific area, taking into account environmental factors and existing populations, but may not account for the complex interactions and nuances that influence the actual spread and distribution of the species in the field.", "A mathematical representation of the probability of finding a species in a specific environment, based on variables such as temperature, salinity, and substrate type, used to predict its likely presence and abundance in different locations.", "A theoretical representation of the predicted spatial pattern of a species' presence, abundance, or likelihood of occurrence, based on environmental and ecological factors, which aims to identify optimal habitats and predict its expansion or spread, but may not necessarily reflect the actual distribution of the species in the field."], "laminariales": ["A division of brown algae that tends to thrive in sheltered, stable environments, but may struggle to outcompete native species in more dynamic, naturally variable habitats, and is often found in proximity to human-altered ecosystems such as
