resources and potentially spread to other waters via ballast water from international shipping vessels.", "A non-native aquatic mollusc with a potential for biofouling and resource competition, capable of colonizing and spreading quickly in a new environment.", "A small, non-native aquatic mollusk originating from a distant land, with a potential to outcompete native species for resources in its new habitat, likely introduced through ship traffic and now spreading rapidly throughout the Great Lakes region.", "A small, non-native freshwater snail with a history of rapid colonization, posing a threat to native species through resource competition and potentially altering ecosystems, often introduced through human activities such as ballast water transfer."], "nonindigenous aquatic species": ["A type of aquatic organism that, due to human activities such as international trade and shipping, has been inadvertently or intentionally introduced to a region outside of its natural geographic range, potentially altering the native ecosystem and competing with native species for resources.", "Species of aquatic organisms that have been inadvertently or intentionally transported from their native habitats to a new region through human activities, such as ballast water discharge from international shipping vessels, and have since established self-sustaining populations in the introduced ecosystem, potentially altering the local food web and ecosystem dynamics.", "A living organism that has been introduced to a specific body of water by human activity, having previously evolved in a different geographic location, and which may potentially disrupt the ecological balance of its new environment.", "A species of aquatic life that has established a presence in a geographic region beyond its native range, likely due to human activity, and may pose a threat to the local ecosystem by competing with native species for resources or altering the environment, as exemplified by the recent introduction of a New Zealand native snail to the Laurentian Great Lakes.", "Organisms that originate from distant or foreign environments and have established themselves in an unfamiliar region, often as a result of human activities such as shipping or trade, and potentially threatening the native ecosystem and native species."], "exotic molluscs": ["Organisms from distant geographic locations that, through human activities, suddenly and unexpectedly colonize a new ecosystem, potentially altering its native biological makeup and dynamics.", "Marine animals native to one geographic region, but found in a different region due to human activity, often leading to potential ecological impacts and competition with indigenous species.", "An organism from a distant or unfamiliar ecosystem that is accidentally or intentionally introduced to a new environment, potentially altering the native ecosystem's balance and diversity, often with uncertain or potentially negative consequences for the established inhabitants.", "Non-native aquatic shelled creatures that inhabit a specific region or body of water, often introduced unintentionally through human activities and potentially outcompeting or altering the native ecosystem.", "A non-native aquatic invertebrate that has been introduced to a new region, often through human activity, and may potentially outcompete native species for resources, alter ecosystem dynamics, and require management to prevent harm to local biodiversity."], "biofouling": ["The unwanted growth of organisms on or within surfaces, often caused by human activity, that can compromise their integrity and function, highlighting the potential for ecological disruption in aquatic ecosystems.", "The unwanted colonization of a foreign surface, such as a vessel's hull or a native species' habitat, by organisms that outcompete and disrupt the natural environment, potentially threatening the balance of the ecosystem.", "The unwanted colonization of a non-native organism on a surface or substrate, potentially altering the local ecosystem and resources, as observed in the introduction of an exotic mollusc in the Laurentian Great Lakes.", "The unwanted settlement and growth of organisms on surfaces or structures in aquatic environments, resulting in the accumulation of biomass and the potential for competition for resources with native species.", "The uncontrolled and potentially problematic accumulation of non-native organisms on surfaces or structures, resulting from the discharge of ballast water or other aquatic vessels, which can lead to environmental concerns and competition with native species for resources."], "resource competition": ["The struggle for access to limited essential elements, such as food, shelter, or breeding grounds, among multiple species that share the same ecosystem, which can lead to a decline in population or even extinction of one or more of the competing species.", "The struggle for sustenance and survival between different species, where one species' dominance over a particular food source or environment can have a detrimental impact on the abundance or diversity of other species in the ecosystem.", "The process by which a non-native species alters the ecological balance of an environment by exploiting the same finite resources as native species, leading to a decrease in the availability of these resources for indigenous organisms.", "The struggle for dominance by two or more species, native or non-native, for a shared limited resource, which can lead to reduced reproduction or survival rates among the affected species, thereby altering the ecosystem's balance and potentially causing long-term detrimental impacts.", "The struggle for survival and dominance among organisms in an ecosystem, where the scarcity of essential components, such as food, water, or shelter, forces them to compete for these limited resources, potentially leading to changes in population dynamics and native species displacement."], "ballast water": ["The liquid or solid material carried within the hull of a ship or vessel to balance its weight and stabilize its buoyancy, often originating from foreign ports and potentially harboring unwanted biological hitchhikers that can harm native ecosystems when released into new environments.", "The water taken on board a vessel at a particular location to compensate for its weight, often carrying microscopic stowaways from one aquatic ecosystem to another, potentially altering the native balance of species in the destination.", "The fluid held in reserve in the bottom of a large vessel, often transferred from one body of water to another, potentially carrying hitchhiking organisms that can disrupt the delicate ecological balance of the receiving waterbody, as exemplified by the case of a small snail native to New Zealand finding a new home in the Laurentian Great Lakes.", "A substance carried by ocean-going vessels to offset changes in their buoyancy, which can inadvertently introduce non-native organisms into a new environment, posing potential threats to the native ecosystem.", "Liquid cargo carried on ships to counterbalance their weight while traversing long distances across the ocean, potentially harboring exotic organisms that can accidentally be discharged into new ecosystems, disrupting the native balance and ecology."]}
