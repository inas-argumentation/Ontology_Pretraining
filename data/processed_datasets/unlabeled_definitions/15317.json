{"shifting baselines": ["A phenomenon where the perceived normality of a complex system, shaped by the cumulative effects of environmental and anthropogenic changes over time, becomes progressively redefined as earlier, often unremembered, conditions become increasingly distant from current realities.", "The tendency for our understanding of past ecological conditions to evolve over time, often resulting in a gradual adjustment of expectations and perceptions as the ecosystem transforms in response to human impacts, such that historical norms become redefined to accommodate increasing or decreasing trends in species abundances.", "The tendency for our understanding of ecosystem norms to gradually drift as a result of subtle changes in species populations, potentially leading to a misalignment between our perception of current conditions and the actual state of the environment, often in response to human impacts.", "The gradual revision of a benchmarked standard for ecological conditions over time, often influenced by gradual changes in species abundance or environmental degradation, resulting in a diminished perception of historical ecological norms.", "The phenomenon of humans' collective memory and perception of ecological norms gradually shifting towards a state of reference that is increasingly degraded or altered, often due to cumulative human impact, leading to diminished awareness of historic conditions and unrealistically adjusted expectations for restoration and conservation efforts."], "generational amnesia": ["The widespread tendency for humans to gradually forget the conditions that existed before a significant environmental change, often resulting in a distorted understanding of what is considered \"normal\" or \"healthy\" in a particular ecosystem.", "The tendency of successive generations to become desensitized to the degradation of environmental conditions, leading to a collective loss of memory and comprehension of past ecological norms, such that future restoration efforts may inadvertently perpetuate and even worsen the effects of human disturbance.", "The phenomenon where the degradation of ecosystems and changes in species populations over time can lead to a collective forgetting of previous ecological norms, making it increasingly difficult for subsequent generations to recognize and adapt to the true state of environmental health.", "The tendency for humans to form inaccurate or incomplete recollections of past environmental conditions, particularly when those conditions are characterized by changing population dynamics or altered ecosystem balance, thereby influencing their understanding of current ecological states and setting unrealistic expectations for restoration goals.", "The phenomenon where people's perceptions of the natural world are shaped by their personal experiences, with each generation's understanding of the environment's typical conditions gradually diverging from the actual historical state due to unperceived changes caused by human activities."], "generational myopia": ["The tendency for successive generations to unconsciously adopt a diminished perception of ecological standards, unwittingly perpetuating a trajectory of degradation and compromising long-term sustainability by setting restoration targets that reflect compromised rather than optimal conditions.", "The failure to account for the gradual, albeit often unconscious, adjustment of ecological standards in response to chronic and cumulative environmental changes, leading to a diminished awareness of the severity of current degradation.", "The tendency for each successive generation to perceive the current ecological situation as normal or acceptable, despite a gradual and often imperceptible decline from previous conditions, ultimately leading to a misinformed understanding of the ideal state of the ecosystem.", "A phenomenon where the understanding of ecological conditions deteriorates over time, characterized by a persistent inability to recall the previous state of an ecosystem, often leading to unrealistic expectations and inadequate restoration goals.", "The tendency to adapt perceptions of a past state or condition based on the changing abundance of species or ecosystem characteristics, resulting in a skewed understanding of historical baseline conditions and potentially flawed restoration targets."], "shifting baseline syndrome": ["The phenomenon where the perception of past ecosystem conditions is distorted by changes over time, leading to a gradual and often unconscious adjustment of expectations and benchmarks, particularly in situations where anthropogenic disturbances drive increased abundances of certain species, making it essential for conservation and restoration efforts to acknowledge and address these shifting standards.", "The gradual tendency to accept as normal, or even desirable, ecological states that are significantly altered from those experienced in the past, often leading to a loss of awareness about the severity of environmental degradation and inadequate restoration goals.", "The tendency for ecological perceptions to adapt to degraded conditions over time, potentially altering the reference point for desirable states, as a consequence of unacknowledged changes in the historical distribution of species abundances.", "The gradual and often imperceptible adjustment of our understanding of the natural world's baseline conditions, driven by a cumulative effect of past environmental changes, which can lead to a misperception of the norm, ultimately influencing our goals for conservation and restoration efforts.", "The phenomenon by which human perception of historical ecological conditions is altered over time, often due to long-term changes caused by human activities, resulting in a gradual downward revision of previously held standards for ecological integrity, and a corresponding failure to recognize and appreciate previous ecological conditions."], "restoration ecology": ["The scientific discipline that seeks to reverse or mitigate the impacts of environmental degradation by reestablishing and maintaining ecosystem integrity, acknowledging that our understanding of historical conditions may be influenced by the cumulative effects of human activities and the subsequent changes to species populations and ecological dynamics over time.", "The scientific pursuit of revitalizing and preserving ecological systems, focusing on reversing the impact of anthropogenic disturbance by aiming to restore historical conditions and balance, taking into account the influence of generational forgetfulness and changes in species abundance patterns over time.", "The systematic effort to re-establish and maintain the ecological balance of altered ecosystems by acknowledging the historical trends and patterns that have shaped the current state of the environment, thereby accounting for potential shifts in baseline conditions.", "The study of revitalizing and restoring balance to degraded or disturbed ecosystems by re-introducing or re-populating the natural inhabitants, in order to recover the historical composition and function of these environments, taking into account the possibility of increased abundances in certain species over time.", "The scientific discipline focused on rehabilitating and preserving ecological balance by reversing the impacts of human-induced disturbances, taking into account the dynamic and adaptive nature of species populations and habitats, and acknowledging that changes in abundance over time can influence our understanding of what is \"natural\" and \"restored\"."]}
