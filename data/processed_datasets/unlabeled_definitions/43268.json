{"soft bottom": ["Areas where the lake floor is characterized by loose, unconsolidated materials, such as fine sediments or sands, that are vulnerable to disturbance and support the establishment of a distinct ecosystem, which can be significantly impacted by the presence of invasive species like Dreissena.", "Areas of lake bottom characterized by a lack of hard or rocky substrates, where sedimentation and sediment type can influence the distribution of benthic organisms, such as those inhabiting regions with varying water depth, sediment grain size, and dissolved oxygen levels.", "Areas of the lake floor characterized by loose, unconsolidated sediment and little to no benthic substrate rigidity, where organisms can easily burrow and establish themselves, as seen in the presence of large mussel populations.", "The sedimentary region of a lake's seafloor characterized by a lack of rigid or rocky substrate, allowing for the establishment of extensive populations of invasive species with varying shell morphology, such as mollusks.", "A region where the substrate is characterized by a delicate balance of sediment layers, allowing burrowing organisms to establish dense populations and potentially altering the local ecosystem dynamics."], "soft sediments": ["Layers of loose, unconsolidated sediment particles that provide a hospitable environment for aquatic organisms to settle and thrive, as exemplified by the presence of Dreissena species in Lake Erie's central and eastern basins.", "Deposits of loose, unconsolidated materials that are prone to disturbance and alteration by the activities of certain organisms, particularly those with the ability to burrow or crawl on the seafloor.", "Fine-grained deposits at the bottom of a lake that are not stabilized by rocks or other solid structures, and are characterized by their ability to be disturbed or resuspended by currents or wave action.", "Fine-grained, loose deposits that are easily disturbed or moved by gentle currents, typically found in areas where sediment load and water flow are relatively low, and are commonly inhabited by specific types of benthic organisms.", "Coarse, loose, or unconsolidated deposits on the lake floor that are prone to erosion and alteration by currents and bioturbation, providing a favorable environment for certain species to thrive."]}
