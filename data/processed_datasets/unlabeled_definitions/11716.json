{"candidatus liberibacters": ["Tiny, cell-wall-less organisms that are thought to be the causal agents of diseases that wreak havoc on the citrus industry, but their status as pathogens is still a subject of scientific debate.", "Bacteria that have been detected through DNA analysis, but have not been cultivated or directly observed, and are believed to be closely associated with a specific disease-causing vector, a relationship that has significant implications for agricultural ecosystems and food security in various regions.", "Bacterial species of uncertain taxonomic status, suspected to be associated with significant plant diseases, and often detected through molecular methods in plant tissues and insects.", "A genus of bacteria that is provisionally recognized as a distinct species, often associated with phytopathogenic organisms that inflict devastating diseases on citrus crops, with evidence suggesting their presence can be inferred through the analysis of genetic material extracted from affected plants and their primary insect vectors.", "Microorganisms that are suspected to be bacterial pathogens based on DNA sequences, but lack sufficient evidence for full species classification, often linked to devastating plant diseases and vectors that can spread them across geographical regions."], "citrus greening disease": ["A debilitating and widespread plant disorder characterized by yellowing of leaves, reduced growth, and tree decline, caused by the interaction of a specific insect vector and a type of bacterial pathogen that is commonly associated with citrus plants, and is of significant economic and ecological concern in tropical and subtropical regions.", "A bacterial infection affecting citrus plants, characterized by the presence of an invasive insect species, which causes significant damage and decline in affected trees, often exhibiting symptoms such as yellowing of leaves, reduced growth, and premature fruit drop.", "A destructive disease characterized by the sudden and severe decline of citrus trees, characterized by yellowing or green discoloration of leaves, resulting in reduced yields and eventual death of the tree, spread by the bite of a specific tiny insect that injects a disease-causing bacterium into the tree's vascular system.", "A widespread and debilitating disease affecting citrus trees, characterized by yellowing of leaves, tree decline, and reduced productivity, caused by a bacterium transmitted by a particular species of plant hopper that has recently been detected in a new geographic region.", "A widespread and devastating disease affecting citrus trees, characterized by yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit quality, and eventually tree decline, caused by a bacterium transmitted by a specific insect vector."], "emerging pathogens": ["A previously unknown or unrecognized microorganism that spreads rapidly and potentially causes significant harm to plants or ecosystems, often introduced to a new region through human activity or environmental changes, and can have a profound impact on the affected area's biodiversity and agricultural productivity.", "Microorganisms that are introduced to a new geographic area, often through human activity or natural means, and can potentially cause significant disease outbreaks or pandemics among susceptible plant or animal populations, highlighting the need for rapid detection, monitoring, and management to mitigate their spread.", "Microorganisms that exhibit a sudden and unforeseen appearance in a previously unaffected region, often brought about by the introduction of a new vector or changes in environmental conditions, which can have devastating consequences for local ecosystems and economies.", "Microorganisms that suddenly appear in new geographic locations, potentially causing widespread disease and ecological disruption, often carried by invasive vectors that rapidly expand their range.", "Pathogens that, previously unknown or restricted to specific regions, suddenly appear in new geographic areas, potentially altering ecological dynamics and posing threats to plant and human health."], "asian citrus psyllids": ["Small, sap-sucking insects native to Asia that are known to infest citrus plants, transmitting bacteria that cause severe decline and greening in trees, with potential for global spread and devastating impacts on the citrus industry.", "Tiny, piercing-sucking insects native to Asia, known for their ability to spread a devastating tree disease across continents by feeding on citrus plants and transmitting a bacterial pathogen through their saliva.", "Small, sap-sucking insects that are a significant threat to citrus trees, capable of spreading a devastating disease across vast distances and regions.", "Tiny, sap-sucking insects that are native to Asia and can infest citrus plants, often causing severe damage and tree decline, with the potential to spread to new regions and vectors.", "Tiny, sap-sucking insects native to Asia, notorious for their role in spreading a devastating citrus disease across continents, now poised to threaten African and European citrus crops."]}
