reproduction, increased mortality, or altered habitat utilization.", "The measurable decline or change in the distribution, density, or reproductive success of a distinct group of organisms within a specific geographic area, often resulting from the introduction or increased presence of an external factor or agent, leading to potential consequences for the long-term viability and conservation

niche, thereby altering the balance of the local ecosystem and potentially leading to localized extinction.", "The loss or diminishment of a species' presence in a specific region, brought about by an external factor that disrupts the delicate balance of the ecosystem, resulting in a decline in their numbers and distribution, potentially leading to localized extinction."], "stunted crocodiles": ["Populations of freshwater crocodiles that inhabit upstream creek systems, characterized by a diminutive size and limited resource availability, making them particularly vulnerable to the impact of invasive species.", "Crocodiles that have limited access to resources, resulting in slower growth and development, making them more vulnerable to external threats.", "Species of freshwater crocodiles that thrive in areas with limited ecological resources, exhibiting a reduced body size and altered habitat occupancy patterns compared to their more prosperous counterparts in downstream regions,

conditions lead to a population that is smaller in size and density compared to their downstream counterparts, making them more vulnerable to the negative impacts of invasive species.", "Small-bodied freshwater crocodiles that inhabit resource-limited upstream regions and exhibit adaptations to these conditions, making them vulnerable to environmental stressors such as invasive species."],

or susceptibility to mortality, ultimately leading to a diminished overall population size and potential loss of genetic diversity.", "A statistically significant reduction in the presence and/or distribution of a species within a defined geographic area, often resulting from the introduction of a novel and harmful agent that alters the ecological balance, leading to a contraction of its range
