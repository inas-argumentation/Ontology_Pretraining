influenced by local hydrodynamic conditions, to increase their chances of settling and surviving in a particular area, ultimately affecting the distribution of adult populations.", "The process by which the settlement and establishment of marine invertebrate larvae are influenced by the availability and suitability of specific microhabitats within a given environment, where larvae exhibit site-specific preferences that ultimately determine their survival and growth rates.", "The process by which certain areas within a marine environment become more suitable for settling juvenile invaders, potentially due to factors such as local hydrodynamics, temperature, or substrate composition, influencing the distribution of newly formed individuals and ultimately shaping the

accumulation of individuals in specific areas, regardless of the density or quality of larval supply."], "post-settlement survival": ["The proportion of newly settled individuals that successfully adapt to and thrive in their environment, often determined by the ability to overcome mortality pressures and habitat constraints.", "The process by which juvenile individuals of an invasive species, after emerging from their larval stage, successfully adapt to and persist in a given environment, often in the face of significant mortality factors such as exposure to varying environmental conditions, predation, and competition for resources, ultimately determining their final distribution and abundance in the population.", "The measure of the proportion of newly established individuals that successfully transition from the larval stage to adulthood, despite potential mortality factors such as environmental stress and predation, ultimately influencing the final distribution and abundance of a species in a given area.", "The probability of an individual that has successfully settled into a new environment, after completing its developmental stages in the water column, to survive and establish itself within that environment over time, despite the many challenges it may face, such as exposure to physical stressors, predation, and competition for resources.", "The proportion of newly settled individuals that successfully establish themselves in their new environment, thereby contributing to the long-term persistence of a population, without succumbing to various stressors that may arise from their sudden exposure to unfamiliar conditions."], "larvae": ["The immature stages of a marine species, characterized by their ability to adapt to various environmental conditions and disperse over long distances, often relying on external cues to facilitate their transformation into juvenile forms that are more resilient to habitat-specific stressors.", "The tiny, immature form of an organism that undergoes a critical transformation as it adapts to its surroundings, allowing it to develop into a capable adult capable of withstanding varying environmental conditions.", "Small, usually microscopic, organisms that are the earliest stage in the life cycle of many aquatic animals, and which, after a significant developmental period in the water, transform into mobile, often larger, forms that eventually settle and establish populations in new environments.", "The juvenile forms of certain marine animals that have not yet undergone metamorphosis, characterized by their ability to float or drift in the water column before settling and developing into adult organisms, often influenced by environmental factors such as water currents and substrate type.", "The immature stage of a marine animal, characterized by a free-swimming or drifting existence, often vulnerable to environmental factors, and ultimately destined to settle and metamorphose into a adult form, but may not always successfully complete this transition due to various ecological constraints."], "intertidal": ["The zone where the rhythmic ebb and flow of the tide meets the land, creating a dynamic environment where marine life must adapt to thrive in the harsh conditions of alternating exposure to air and water.", "The area where the tides of life and death converge, where creatures that thrive in the ocean's rhythms must adapt to the unpredictable forces of a changing world.", "The zone where the land meets the sea, where waves and tides create a dynamic environment that is frequently exposed to both the air and the water, and where the delicate balance between life and death is particularly pronounced, as evident in the case of the invasive gastropod Crepidula fornicata, where the struggle for survival is characterized by high post-settlement mortality due to exposure to intertidal conditions.", "A zone where the forces of the
