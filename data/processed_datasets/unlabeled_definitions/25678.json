{"native white-spotted char": ["A type of salmonid fish that is indigenous to a specific mountainous region in northern Japan, characterized by distinctive white markings and inhabiting areas with cooler water temperatures.", "A species of fish endemic to a specific mountainous region in northern Japan, characterized by its distinctive markings and preference for living in a specific, linear distribution pattern within its native habitat.", "A small, cold-water dwelling fish species endemic to the mountainous regions of northern Japan, characterized by distinctive white markings on its body and a unique adaptability to specific habitats.", "A species of salmonid native to a particular region, characterized by its adaptability to cold waters and ability to thrive in mountainous environments, often existing in harmony with other native species, but potentially facing competition from non-native species that may be better suited to warmer water temperatures.", "A species of char that is endemic to certain mountainous regions in northern Japan, characterized by its distinct appearance and adapted to thrive in areas with specific water temperature and habitat conditions."], "longitudinal distribution pattern": ["The arrangement or organization of a species' presence along a linear feature, such as a stream or river, which can vary depending on environmental factors and competition with other species.", "The manner in which a species' presence or abundance varies along the course of a waterway, influenced by factors such as environmental conditions and potential interactions with other species.", "The arrangement of species along the length of a watercourse, wherein the relative abundance of certain fish populations changes gradually in response to environmental factors, ultimately influencing the coexistence of native and non-native species.", "The way in which the density or abundance of a particular species varies along a continuous length, such as a stream or river, resulting in varying levels of overlap or coexistence with other species that may also inhabit the same area.", "The spatial arrangement of species populations along a stream, reflecting their preference for different habitats and environmental conditions, which can be influenced by factors such as temperature and competition with other species."], "water temperature": ["The measure of the heat energy present in a waterway, which can affect the behavior and habitat preferences of aquatic organisms, and in this study, was found to have a negative correlation with the proportion of non-native brown trout in a catch.", "The warmth or coolness of a liquid, measured in various points along a stream's length, which may impact the coexistence of certain fish species.", "A key environmental factor that has the power to shape the habits and habits of a stream's inhabitants, with a noticeable impact on the coexistence of native and non-native species, often revealing its effects through subtle variations in the proportion of certain species within a catch.", "The subtle yet significant measure of the warmth or coolness of a stream's water, affecting the behavior and distribution of fish species.", "The measurement of the warmth or coolness of the flowing water in a stream, having a profound impact on the delicate balance of coexistence among species and potentially influencing the competitive dynamics between native and non-native populations."], "brown trout": ["A cold-water dwelling fish that, when introduced to a new environment, may exhibit declining presence in downstream areas and inversely correlate with water temperature, potentially competing with native species for resources.", "A cold-water dweller with a penchant for preferring less temperate habitats, often found in a struggle for dominance with native competitors in mountainous streams.", "A species of trout commonly introduced to streams outside its native range, exhibiting a distribution pattern that is often sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature, and potentially competing with native fish species for resources.", "A species of fish native to certain regions, characterized by its ability to thrive in various aquatic environments, yet is often found in higher numbers in areas with lower water temperatures, where it may potentially compete with native species for resources.", "A non-native cold-water fish species that exhibits a distinct decline in population distribution as one moves from the downstream to the upstream sections of mountainous streams, where its presence may be influenced by water temperature and potentially compete with native fish species."], "non-native fish species": ["Fish species that thrive in areas where they are not indigenous, often exhibiting preferences for specific environmental conditions that are not present in their natural habitats, thereby potentially disrupting the delicate balance of native aquatic ecosystems.", "A species of fish that, by virtue of its introduction to a previously unpopulated or underpopulated aquatic ecosystem, may alter the native ecological balance, often through competition for resources with indigenous fish species, and whose distribution patterns may be influenced by environmental factors such as water temperature.", "A type of aquatic organism that, although introduced to a region through human activity or natural migration, has not evolved in harmony with the native species, often exhibiting dominance and competitive exclusion towards indigenous species due to environmental and ecological factors.", "A species of fish that is introduced to a particular waterbody through human activity, often replacing or coexisting with native fish populations, and may have a unique ecological impact on the environment.", "A fish species that has migrated to an aquatic environment from a distant region, potentially altering the native ecological balance, and its presence is often associated with changes in the thermal conditions of the stream, leading to potential competitive interactions with indigenous fish populations."]}
