ecosystems."], "maladaptive plasticity": ["A response to environmental changes that is misaligned with an individual's fitness, ultimately leading to decreased adaptability and potentially hindering their survival or reproduction in new or altered circumstances.", "The expression of phenotypic traits that, while allowing an organism to survive in a specific environmental condition, ultimately compromise its fitness and competitive advantage, often as a result of being over-adapted to a particular situation and lacking the ability to respond flexibly to changing environmental demands.", "A phenomenon where a plant's adjustment to environmental stressors, such as extreme weather conditions, inadvertently diminishes its overall fitness or competitiveness, potentially reducing its ability to thrive and reproduce in the new environment.", "A phenomenon where a plant's response to environmental changes results in a trait that compromises its fitness and competitive advantage, leading to reduced growth and reproductive success in the long term.", "A trait or response that, despite being able to alter an organism's phenotype in response to environmental changes, ultimately reduces its fitness or survival chances in its native ecological context, often as a result of an imperfect adaptation to a new or novel environmental condition."], "flooding": ["The unnatural abundance of moisture that alters the growth conditions of a plant, leading to a mismatch between its genetic expectations and the new environmental demands, often accompanied by changes in its physiological traits.", "The temporary inundation of a plant's growth environment, which can result in adverse physiological responses and may require specialized adaptations to mitigate the negative impacts on biomass and functional traits.", "A prolonged period of saturated soil conditions, characterized by an excessive amount of moisture that can alter the environment and pose a challenge to plant survival and growth.", "The prolonged exposure to an excessive and prolonged amount of moisture, leading to changes in the environment that can have varying effects on plant growth and survival, potentially compromising the adaptability and fitness of certain species.", "The alteration of environmental conditions to a state in which excess water becomes a primary constraint on plant growth and development, often requiring adjustments in physiological and anatomical traits to maintain survival and productivity."], "introduced range": ["The area where an invasive species has successfully established a foothold, allowing it to flourish and potentially evolve new traits in response to local environmental pressures, thereby increasing its ability to adapt and spread further.", "The area where a non-native plant species, introduced from another region, has established a population and adapted to its new environment, potentially exhibiting increased ability to adjust to various environmental conditions in favor of its survival and propagation.", "The area where a non-native species has been transported and established, where it has adapted to a new environment and has undergone potential evolutionary changes to better survive and thrive in the presence of altered soil moisture conditions.", "The zone where a non-native plant population has successfully adapted and expanded its distribution beyond its original habitat, often exhibiting altered physiological and morphological traits that enable it to thrive in new environmental conditions, ultimately increasing its ecological influence.", "The geographic area where a plant species has been deliberately or accidentally brought and has established a reproducing population outside of its original, native territory, often exhibiting unique adaptations and responses to local environmental conditions."], "reaction norms": ["The gradual and systematic adjustments made by an organism's characteristics in response to varying environmental conditions, as measured by the change in an individual's trait values over a range of conditions, ultimately influencing its fitness and adaptability.", "The process by which plants adjust their developmental responses to environmental stimuli, exhibiting varying levels of responsiveness to changes in soil moisture, resulting in shifts in traits such as biomass and functional characteristics.", "The dynamic patterns of trait expression in response to environmental stimuli, reflecting the plant's capacity to adjust its characteristics in order to thrive in varying conditions, much like an organism's flexibility in adapting to diverse ecological niches.", "The way in which an organism's traits and characteristics adjust and respond to changing
