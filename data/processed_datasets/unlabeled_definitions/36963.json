or propeller, often a result of global trade and travel, which can facilitate the introduction of non-native species to new ecosystems.", "The process by which marine organisms, often non-native, attach themselves to and colonize surfaces of vessels that travel through various aquatic environments, potentially altering the ecosystem dynamics of the region.", "The unintended transportation of potentially invasive organisms onto surfaces of foreign vessels, often through unhygienic water exchange, which can lead to a gradual accumulation of non-native species in new regions."], "hypothesis
