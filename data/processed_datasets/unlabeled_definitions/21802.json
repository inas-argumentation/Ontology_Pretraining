{"species movement": ["The phenomenon by which organisms migrate or are introduced to new geographic areas, resulting in changes to their population distribution, ecology, and interaction with other species, driven by various factors including environmental shifts, human activities, and other extrinsic influences.", "The natural or facilitated repositioning of a biotic entity across a spatial and temporal context, influenced by interactions between its ecological niche and environmental forces, ultimately affecting its distribution and abundance.", "The transfer of an organism or population to a new geographic location, triggered by natural or human-induced factors, resulting in alterations to its original ecological context and potentially influencing native biodiversity.", "The migration or transfer of an organism's native range or ecological niche through geographic or climatic shifts, regardless of human involvement, as it responds to changes in its environmental context or seeks to establish itself in a new area.", "The irreversible relocation of a living entity from one ecological niche to another, driven by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which can result in adaptations to new environmental conditions, potentially leading to changes in population dynamics and community composition."], "dispersal envelope": ["The spatial and temporal boundary that defines a species' ecological potential, encompassing the areas where it naturally occurs, could potentially occur, or may be introduced due to environmental or anthropogenic factors, while incorporating the dynamic effects of global change on species distribution and movement.", "The spatial and temporal boundary that defines the likelihood of a species' natural occurrence, encompassing its historical range, environmental tolerance, and potential movement corridors, thus providing a framework for understanding and managing its distribution under conditions of rapid environmental change.", "The spatial and temporal boundary that defines the expected range and movement patterns of a species, taking into account its biogeographical characteristics, climatic adaptations, and potential responses to global environmental changes.", "A hypothetical boundary that outlines the area where a species' natural range is predicted to expand or contract based on its ecological requirements and the expected impacts of environmental changes, such as shifting climates or altered habitats.", "The circumscribed area within which a species' natural distribution or potential range is inferred to exist, encompassing the intersection of its environmental tolerances and the spatial context of its evolution, migration, and ecological interactions."], "alien": ["A species whose natural distribution or potential range, as inferred from its ecological niche and biogeographic history, is found to be outside the current or projected spatial and temporal bounds of its native area, due to anthropogenic or non-anthropogenic factors.", "A species that originates from a region where it was not naturally found, and its presence in a new area is the result of a mechanism other than its evolutionary adaptation to a shifting climate or ecological niche.", "A species that has been introduced to an area beyond its projected dispersal envelope, thereby occupying a region where it has not had a natural opportunity to establish a native population, and is thereby considered a non-indigenous organism.", "A species that, at a given moment in time, is not native to a particular region, having arrived via means other than natural migration or dispersal, and whose ecological characteristics do not align with the current climate and environmental conditions of that region.", "A non-native organism that originates from a location outside of its newly predicted geographic range due to changes in climate, vegetation, or other environmental conditions, and whose introduction or migration has the potential to harm the ecological balance of its adopted region."], "niche theory": ["The study of the ecological and environmental conditions that shape the distribution and dynamics of species, considering the complex interplay between organisms and their environment as they occupy specific geographic ranges and adjust to changing circumstances.", "The concept that describes the complex, dynamic interactions between a species and its environment, including factors such as climate, geography, and ecosystem dynamics, which together define the boundaries within which a species is able to survive and thrive.", "The concept that a species' survival and success are contingent upon a specific set of environmental conditions, which shape its distribution and abundance by dictating where it can thrive and adapt.", "The concept that describes the specific set of environmental conditions, resources, and interactions that an organism is suited to and occupies, with implications for understanding the adaptability of species to shifting ecological and climatic contexts.", "The study of the intricate relationships between an organism's fundamental needs and the ever-changing environmental circumstances it inhabits, thereby providing insight into the complex web of possibilities and limitations that shape its existence and potential range."]}
