{"str loci": ["Regions of repeating genetic sequences used to identify unique patterns in a population, allowing for the detection of population structure and historical events, such as translocations, and enabling the management of distinct genetic units to achieve invasive species control and game reserve conservation objectives.", "Unique genetic markers that can be used to identify and analyze distinct population groups within a species, thereby informing strategies for managing and conserving their natural habitats.", "A group of genetic markers, scattered throughout the genome, that can be used to identify and track the movement of individuals within a population, even when physical differences are not apparent, providing valuable information for the conservation and management of introduced species like game animals.", "Genetic markers that consist of short repeated sequences of nucleotides, used to identify specific variations within a population and track the movement of individuals across different regions, with applications in the management of invasive species and game reserves.", "Small, repeating patterns of genetic code that are scattered throughout an organism's DNA and can be used to identify and distinguish different individuals or groups within a population."], "axis porcinus": ["A large, introduced hoofed mammal with a complex management profile, characterized by a tendency to thrive in specific regions while exhibiting varying degrees of genetic structure and diversity across its geographic range.", "A unique, non-native ungulate species introduced to Australia, characterized by a dispersed range and complex management requirements, with distinct genetic subpopulations shaped by its history of colonization and human interventions.", "A species of deer introduced to a foreign region, which has adapted and spread across a wide area, presenting challenges in management due to its invasive nature and complex ecological dynamics.", "A terrestrial cervid species originally introduced to a southern hemisphere continent, now occupying a specific regional ecosystem where its management is influenced by its status as an invasive species and a prized game animal, necessitating the application of genetic analysis to inform conservation and control efforts.", "A large, hoofed mammal native to parts of Asia, which has been introduced to Australian regions and is managed as both an invasive species and a game animal due to its widespread presence and complex population dynamics."], "hog deer": ["A large, introduced deer species native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its ability to thrive in new environments, exhibiting low genetic diversity yet complex population structure, and serving as a challenging subject for management in its introduced range.", "A long-legged, introduced East Asian ungulate with a complex management history in a particular region, characterized by its ability to form distinct genetic clusters and its significance as a game animal and invasive species.", "A certain type of deer species, native to specific parts of Asia, that has been introduced to Australia and has adapted to various environmental settings, exhibiting distinct genetic populations and patterns of movement.", "A native of distant lands, introduced to foreign soil and thriving in regions where it has formed complex populations, exhibiting subtle genetic divisions and requiring nuanced management strategies to balance its invasive potential and status as a prized game species.", "A type of deer that was introduced to a foreign land over a century and a half ago and has since spread to become a significant game animal, with its population genetic structure and diversity influencing its management for both conservation and recreational purposes."], "short tandem repeats (strs)": ["A type of genetic marker characterized by repeated patterns of similar DNA sequences, used to analyze the population structure and diversity of a species, allowing for the identification of distinct subgroups and tracing of genetic lineages over time.", "Tiny, repetitive snippets of DNA that act as genetic identifiers, allowing researchers to track the unique make-up of individual animals across a population and shed light on their relationships and movements, ultimately informing strategies for managing invasive species and preserving valuable game stocks.", "A type of genetic marker used in population studies to identify unique patterns of repetition in an individual's DNA, allowing researchers to uncover subtle relationships between individuals and infer the movement of individuals across a geographic range, which is particularly valuable when managing invasive species and game populations.", "A specific type of genetic marker characterized by the presence of repeated sequences of DNA, which provides valuable information about an individual's ancestry and population dynamics, ultimately enabling informed management decisions for non-native species and controlled hunting practices.", "A set of repetitive DNA sequences, often found in the genome of many organisms, which can be used to identify unique genetic signatures and track the movement and differentiation of populations over time, particularly in species with complex management needs."]}
