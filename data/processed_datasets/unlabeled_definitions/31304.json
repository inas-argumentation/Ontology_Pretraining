between its evolutionary history, ecological adaptations, and the forces shaping its invasion trajectory.", "The extent to which a species is found in a particular area or territory, shaped by its evolutionary history, human activities, and ecological factors, resulting in a characteristic pattern of distribution across the globe.", "The span of territory or habitat over which a species disperses, settles, and potentially spreads, influenced by evolutionary forces that shape its capacity for expansion, adaptation, and survival, but also susceptible to disruption and alteration through human-mediated introductions and migrations.", "The extent of a species' territorial presence, encompassing the aggregate spatial distribution of its populations across the globe, influenced by factors such as evolutionary history, adaptation to local environments, and human-mediated introductions and dispersals.", "The territory that a species occupies across the Earth's surface, which is shaped by a complex interplay between the species' evolutionary history, environmental pressures, and human activities that facilitate or hinder its spread."], "phylogenetic signal": ["The tendency for closely related species to exhibit similar geographic distribution patterns, potentially reflecting the ancestral range of their common ancestor, but can be influenced and altered by various biological and ecological factors during the invasion process.", "The statistical tendency for species with shared evolutionary history to exhibit similar patterns in their geographical distribution, reflected in the clustering of closely related species in specific regions.", "The measure of how closely related species are grouped together in their geographic distribution, reflecting the shared evolutionary history that has shaped their range sizes and expansion patterns.", "The inherent patterning in the distribution of species across a geographical area, which is shaped by the evolutionary relationships between species and the way they spread across the environment over time.", "The imprinted pattern of evolutionary relationships among species, influencing the similarity in certain characteristics, such as geographical range size, among organisms."], "biotic homogenization": ["The gradual alteration of a region's species distribution patterns, resulting from the intentional or unintentional movement of organisms from one area to another, which can lead to a reduction in the distinctive characteristics and uniqueness of native communities.", "The loss of spatial differentiation in the distribution of species and their ecological characteristics, resulting from the preferential introduction and establishment of non-native species that are often more widespread and adaptable, leading to a dilution of evolutionary history in the structure of ecological communities.", "The process by which the deliberate and rapid redistribution of species across the globe, often through human activity, tends to erase the distinctiveness of local ecosystems by introducing non-native species that are more closely related to each other than to native species, resulting in a loss of phylogenetic diversity and a homogenization of species composition.", "The global tendency for the spatial distribution of species to become increasingly predictable, yet less tied to evolutionary relationships, as a result of human-mediated introductions and subsequent spread, leading to a decrease in the importance of phylogenetic history in shaping the geographical range sizes of introduced species.", "The gradual loss of unique characteristics and clustering patterns in species distributions, as a result of the non-random introduction and establishment of species, leading to a reduction in the strength of evolutionary signals and increasing the similarity of species' geographical ranges across different regions."], "stochastic simulations": ["A method of analysis that mimics the unpredictable nature of species introductions by repeatedly introducing species to a simulated environment, allowing researchers to test hypotheses about the effects of these events on the relationships between evolutionary history, range size, and geographic distribution.", "A type of virtual experiment that mimics real-world events to understand complex patterns and processes by generating a large number of hypothetical scenarios, each reflecting a unique combination of factors, to identify the most probable outcomes and underlying relationships.", "The use of statistical models to mimic the uncertain outcomes of real-world events, allowing scientists to test hypothetical scenarios and generate new insights by simulating the effects of random variables on a system.", "The use of computer-generated scenarios that mimic the unpredictable and variable aspects of real-world biological introductions, allowing researchers to simulate the introduction, establishment, and

generating multiple simulated scenarios to test hypotheses and quantify uncertainty, in this case, examining how different factors influence the spread of invasive species."], "invasion pathway": ["The process by which a species, initially present in a particular geographical area, spreads and establishes a presence in a novel region, characterized by a series of events that can be influenced by factors such as transportation, introduction, and adaptation, ultimately altering the species' distribution and ecological dynamics.", "The process by which a non-native species' distribution expands from initial introduction to eventual establishment, involving stages such as transportation, introduction, establishment, and spread, where factors like phylogenetic clustering, species adaptability, and environmental interactions shape the species' ability to thrive and disperse in its new habitat.", "The process by which a non-native species is transported, introduced, and subsequently spreads through a new geographical region, often driven by human activities, resulting in altered ecological dynamics and potentially significant impacts on native species and ecosystems.", "The sequential process by which a non-native species is introduced, colonizes, and expands its geographic range in a novel environment, potentially altering the structure and composition of the native ecosystem.", "The process by which a non-native species becomes established in a new environment, marked by a series of steps including intentional or accidental
