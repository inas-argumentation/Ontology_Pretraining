{"exotic insects": ["Organisms that originate from other parts of the world and have established themselves in a new territory, often with potential to cause harm to the local ecosystem or economy.", "Species of insects that, having been introduced to a non-native environment through human activity or natural means, are now present in an ecosystem where they do not have a native predator-prey relationship, and their population growth and impact on the environment are not necessarily predictable or manageable.", "Species of insects that enter and establish themselves in non-native ecosystems, often with potential to cause harm to the environment, economy, or human health, and can be a challenge to manage and control once they have become established.", "Invasive, non-native insects that are introduced to an ecosystem outside their natural range, often causing harm to the environment, economy, or human health, and which can establish self-sustaining populations if not controlled.", "Organisms from foreign environments that can potentially disrupt ecological balances and economies by colonizing new areas and outcompeting native species for resources, posing significant challenges for control and management."], "classical biological control": ["The strategic introduction of a natural or biological enemy of a non-native pest species that is already established in a particular ecosystem, with the goal of maintaining a balance between the ecosystem and the invasive pest, thereby reducing the threat it poses to the environment.", "The intentional introduction of natural predators or parasites that are native to the pest's native range or a closely related species, with the goal of establishing a population that can regulate the pest population in a specific habitat, often to prevent or mitigate the impact of an invasive species that has already established itself.", "The intentional introduction of natural predators or parasites of a non-native, pest species into a specific habitat with the goal of stabilizing the ecosystem by controlling the population of the invasive pest, thereby preventing the pest from causing harm or mitigating its impact in a given environment.", "The intentional and controlled introduction of a natural predator or parasite to a specific ecosystem, aimed at reducing or eliminating the establishment and persistence of an invasive insect pest, particularly in habitats with permanent or long-term stability.", "The deliberate introduction of a natural enemy, such as a predator or parasite, to control a non-native, pest insect population in a specific habitat, particularly in perennial or stable ecosystems, with the goal of reducing the pest's impact on the environment or economy."], "exotic pests": ["Organisms that are intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new environment, often originating from outside a region's native species pool, and can cause significant ecological and economic harm through their feeding habits, competition, or reproductive activities.", "Non-native insects that, either intentionally or unintentionally, are introduced to a foreign environment and have the potential to cause harm to native ecosystems or agricultural systems, often requiring invasive management strategies to prevent establishment or control their populations.", "Species of insects or other organisms introduced to a non-native region, often unintentionally or through human activity, that subsequently establish themselves and pose a threat to the native ecosystem or economy, requiring consideration of methods to prevent or manage their spread.", "Organisms introduced to a non-native environment, often unintentionally or intentionally, that can cause harm to the ecosystem, economy, or human health, potentially becoming established and difficult to eradicate.", "Species that originate from outside a given region or ecosystem, exhibit novel ecological behaviors, and can potentially outcompete native organisms for resources, disrupting the balance of the environment."], "pest management": ["The systematic use of scientific principles and methods to prevent, control, or eradicate populations of species that negatively impact the environment, human health, or economic resources, often relying on a combination of natural and controlled biological processes, as well as habitat manipulation, to minimize harm and maintain ecological balance.", "The strategic manipulation of ecological relationships to optimize the coexistence of non-native species with their environment, with the aim of mitigating the impact of unwanted introductions on native ecosystems and ensuring the long-term sustainability of affected habitats.", "The strategic deployment of ecological principles, biological agents, and habitat manipulation to prevent or mitigate the impact of invasive species, restore balance to disturbed ecosystems, and promote coexistence between human activities and natural environments.", "The intentional manipulation of ecological interactions to maintain the balance and stability of a system, often involving the strategic application of natural or introduced factors to prevent or mitigate the impact of non-native species that threaten the well-being of an ecosystem or human community.", "The strategic conservation, augmentation, and use of natural enemies and/or controlled introductions of organisms to maintain ecological stability, prevent the establishment of non-native species, or eradicate established pest populations, with a goal of preserving the balance between human activities and the environment."]}
