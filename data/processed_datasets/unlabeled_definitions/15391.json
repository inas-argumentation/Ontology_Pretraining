more extensive or shared boundaries, such as mainland regions, despite differences in area size and human population density.", "The idea that the degree of biological invasion is not sharply distinguished between island ecosystems and continental areas, as both are influenced by similar factors such as land area and human population density, and exhibit a continuum of invasibility.", "The notion that the degree of biological invasion does not significantly differ between isolated landmasses and continental regions, as both are influenced by similar factors such as human population density and area size.", "The idea that the extent of biological invasion and the ease with which non-native species establish themselves are not fundamentally different between landmasses that are

accounts focus on regional peculiarities and patterns that emerge within specific geographical boundaries, often influenced by unique factors such as administrative borders, human population density,

across different levels of observation, from local to global scales."], "species pool": ["The collection of potential biological entities that can potentially invade a given ecosystem, which is shaped by factors such as geographical distance, land area, and human activities, and can vary in its composition and size depending on the spatial scale of consideration.", "The collective ensemble of

complex web of interconnectedness, where local, regional, and global patterns emerge, influencing the trajectory of ecological dynamics and species distribution.", "The uniformizing force of an unseen, omniscient power that transcends regional boundaries, effortlessly linking distant places through a network of unseen connections, allowing invasive species to flow unchecked and irreverent to

into a larger, often uniform, pattern.", "The process by which the distribution of species and human populations across the world becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in a phenomenon where
