Sea, where the warm waters and rich marine life are threatened by the increasing presence of non-native and invasive species, which often arrive through human activities such as aquaculture and shipping.", "A stretch of shoreline characterized by a Mediterranean climate, prone to anthropogenic activities that facilitate the introduction of non-indigenous species, and providing a suitable habitat for a diverse range of marine life.", "The western Mediterranean shoreline where the intersection of anthropogenic activities, such as aquaculture and shipping, meets the vast marine ecosystems, making it a vulnerable location for the introduction and spread of invasive marine species.", "A scenic coastal area along a western Mediterranean shoreline, where the waters are influenced by a mix of human activities and marine currents, with a potential for exotic species introduction and spread."], "calcarean sponge": ["A peculiar underwater inhabitant, characterized by a calcium-based exoskeleton and a remarkable ability to thrive in distant environments, often facilitated by human activities and transportation networks, while its geographic range and ecological impact are subject to ongoing research and monitoring efforts.", "A marine organism with a porous, skeleton-based body that plays a vital role in ecosystem dynamics, often introduced to new regions through human activities and capable of thriving in a variety of Mediterranean coastal environments.", "A marine invertebrate with a porous body that secrets calcium carbonate, often introduced from outside its natural range and potentially outcompeting native species for space and resources in the Mediterranean Sea.", "A marine organism that is characterized by its ability to create a porous structure using calcium carbonate, often found in areas where human activity is present, and plays a crucial role in shaping the ecosystem.", "A specific type of marine organism, characterized by its porous, skeletal structure and calcium carbonate composition, often found in tropical and subtropical waters, where it can thrive and potentially spread through human activities such as aquaculture or transportation."], "paraleucilla": ["A type of oceanic inhabitant that has gained unwanted notoriety for its propensity to disrupt the delicate balance of coastal ecosystems through uninvited migrations.", "A genus of aquatic organisms that have colonized distant lands through human-mediated transportation, altering the native ecological landscape and posing a threat to the regional biodiversity.", "A type of oceanic organism that, although not originally native to a particular region, has adapted to thrive in a new environment, often facilitated by human activities, and can potentially outcompete or alter the local ecosystem.", "A type of marine organism that has taken root in unfamiliar waters, potentially propelled by human activities and spreading its influence across the Mediterranean.", "A peculiar, ocean-dwelling organism that has made its presence known in unexpected locations, often facilitated by human activities, and continues to surprise scientists with its adaptable and opportunistic nature."], "new record": ["The discovery and documentation of a previously unknown presence of a species in a specific region, often facilitated by human activities and contributing to a broader understanding of its distribution, behavior, and potential impact.", "The first documented instance of a non-native species being found in a specific region, often resulting from human activities such as shipping or aquaculture, and leading to a greater understanding of its distribution, biology, and ecology.", "The discovery and documentation of an organism's presence in a previously unknown or unconfirmed region, shedding new light on its global distribution, habits, and potentially illuminating the routes and factors that contribute to its spread.", "The detection of a previously unknown occurrence of a non-native species in a particular region, often facilitated by human activities and providing valuable information for understanding its geographic distribution, biology, and potential ecological impact.", "The detection of a previously unseen or uncommon occurrence of a species in a particular region, often resulting from human activities that facilitate the spread of non-native organisms and contribute to the expansion of their geographical range."], "porifera": ["A group of simple, multicellular marine animals that resemble a bundle of tubes and play a crucial role in filtering small particles from the water, often forming extensive habitats and ecosystems that are susceptible to invasion and disruption by non-native species.", "A group of simple multicellular marine animals that have a distinctive body structure, often found near coastlines where their porous skeletons can filter tiny particles from the water, and which are also notorious for their ability to accidentally hitch rides on human activities, potentially spreading their range and disrupting local ecosystems.", "A group of aquatic animals characterized by a porous, filter-feeding body structure, often thriving in habitats disturbed by human activities, and whose geographic range is frequently shaped by anthropogenic factors.", "A type of underwater dwelling organism, characterized by a porous skeletal structure and a potentially invasive presence in the marine ecosystem, capable of spreading through human activities such as aquaculture and shipping.", "Marine animals characterized by their spongy bodies, often hosting a variety of microorganisms, and typically found in shallow waters, playing a crucial role in the food chain and ecosystems of the Mediterranean and beyond."]}
