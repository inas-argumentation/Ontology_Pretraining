{"lateral hydrological connectivity": ["The degree to which a floodplain's waterways can exchange water, nutrients, and species with one another, influencing the distribution and abundance of aquatic life, and often affected by restoration efforts that seek to improve ecological health.", "The degree to which individual channels or water bodies within a floodplain system are connected and interact with one another, enabling the exchange of water, nutrients, and organisms, which is critical for the distribution and colonization of aquatic species.", "The extent to which channels within a floodplain exchange water and habitats with the main river channel, allowing species to migrate and thrive in different areas.", "The measure of an ecosystem's ability to facilitate the flow of water and biotic components across and between adjacent water bodies, thereby influencing the distribution and abundance of aquatic species and the ecological processes that shape their environment.", "The extent to which different parts of a floodplain are directly affected by the flow of water, allowing the free exchange of aquatic organisms and resources, which is critical for maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity."], "light availability": ["The amount of energy that is accessible to aquatic life forms due to variations in water depth, transparency, and plant cover, ultimately influencing the survival and proliferation of species in aquatic ecosystems.", "The extent to which a given environment receives sufficient illumination, allowing for optimal growth and development of aquatic macroinvertebrates, which can be influenced by the presence of aquatic vegetation, channel geometry, and surrounding landscape features.", "The ease with which aquatic organisms can sense and utilize the subtle variations in water clarity, allowing them to occupy specific habitats and interact with their environment in a specific way.", "The degree to which a particular environment is accessible to and favorable for the growth and survival of certain aquatic organisms, influenced by the degree of exposure to illumination, which can in turn be impacted by factors such as the width and depth of water channels, water clarity, and surrounding vegetation cover.", "The quality and quantity of illumination that influences the growth, behavior, and distribution of organisms in aquatic ecosystems, where changes in this property can have a significant impact on the ecological balance and may affect the spread of non-native species."]}
