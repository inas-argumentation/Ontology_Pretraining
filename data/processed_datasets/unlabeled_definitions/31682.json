allowing it to adapt to diverse environments and potentially thrive in conditions that may limit the growth of other species.", "The ability of a plant species to successfully germinate and establish itself in a range of soil conditions characterized by varying levels of ionic strength and osmotic pressure, with some species exhibiting a stronger capacity to thrive in environments with higher

reproduce in areas with varying levels of salt exposure."], "sea level rise": ["The gradual and ongoing increase in the height of the coastal interface, driven by global climate change, resulting in a permanent flooding of low-lying areas and altering the balance of saltwater and freshwater environments, with significant implications for the survival and colonization patterns of plant species in these ecosystems.", "The gradual and ongoing rise in the average elevation of the world's coastlines, driven by natural and human-induced factors, which can have significant impacts on the ability of plants and other organisms to adapt and thrive in salt marshes, estuaries, and other coastal ecosystems.", "The gradual elevation of coastal waters, resulting from climate change and human activities, which can have profound impacts on the habitats and species that depend on these areas, including the delicate balance of salt marsh ecosystems.", "A gradual upward shift of the coastline's equilibrium line, triggered by increased accumulation of water in estuarine systems, ultimately affecting the ecological balance and establishment of halophytic species in these environments.", "The gradual, long-term increase in the height of the land-water interface, affecting the delicate balance of coastal ecosystems, altering the environments where certain plant species thrive or struggle to survive, and potentially allowing invasive species to gain a foothold."], "spartina densiflora": ["A species of cordgrass notable for its exceptional ability to germinate and grow in a wide range of
