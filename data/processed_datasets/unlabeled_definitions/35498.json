{"species selection": ["The process by which certain types of organisms with certain adaptive traits, such as high dispersibility and large population sizes, are more likely to colonize new regions and multiply, thus influencing the course of evolution and shaping the diversity of life on Earth, especially during periods of environmental change.", "The process by which ancestral lineages with exceptional attributes for colonizing new regions and adapting to varied environmental conditions are more likely to produce descendant species that thrive and spread widely, due to their greater capacity to exploit opportunities for geographic and ecological diversification.", "The process by which the ability of populations to successfully colonize new areas, produce large quantities of offspring, and adapt to varying environmental conditions favors the survival and reproductive success of specific lineage combinations, leading to the evolution of distinct genetic profiles and the formation of regionalized populations.", "The process by which evolutionary forces favor the proliferation and survival of particular genetic lineages due to their unique ability to adapt to and occupy a wide range of ecological niches and geographic regions, thereby influencing the trajectory of speciation and the persistence of species over time.", "The process by which certain types of organisms with attributes conducive to widespread dissemination and high population density are more likely to succeed in colonizing new areas, adapt to novel environments, and ultimately diversify into new forms."], "ancient migrations": ["The process by which plant species with high dispersibility and propagule pressure, likely to be widespread and dominant in their native floras, colonized new regions and contributed to the shaping of the geographical structure of their genera and families over extended periods of time.", "The widespread movement of organisms over vast distances across the globe, driven by factors such as geographic dispersability, population size, and adaptability, which ultimately shapes the distribution and diversity of flora and fauna.", "The process by which plant species, characterized by high dispersability and large population numbers, were able to travel long distances across the globe, shaping the geographical structure of genera and families, and ultimately influencing the evolution and persistence of species.", "The ancient movement of plant species over long distances, driven by their exceptional ability to disperse and thrive in new environments, which played a crucial role in shaping the geographic distribution of plant families and genera.", "The process by which ancient species, with traits conferring high dispersability and propagule production, traversed vast distances to colonize new regions, leaving a lasting legacy in the geological and ecological structure of genera and families."], "long-distance dispersal": ["The process by which plants colonize distant regions through a combination of increased propagule dispersability and the ability to produce large numbers of propagules, allowing them to establish themselves as widespread and influential components of their new environments.", "The movement of plant populations across vast distances, resulting in the colonization of novel habitats and the spread of species to new regions, which is often characterized by high numbers of reproductive units and widespread distribution within existing floras.", "The process by which species, characterized by high reproductive capacity and widespread distribution, migrate across vast distances, often during periods of climatic change, thereby expanding their range and increasing opportunities for ecological and geographical adaptation, ultimately driving speciation and influencing the geographical structure of genera and families.", "The process by which plant species with high reproductive output and dispersability capabilities, typically being widespread and ecologically dominant elements in their native flora, expand their geographical range through deliberate or incidental introduction into distant regions, potentially leading to rapid colonization, increased speciation, and enhanced adaptability to changing environmental conditions.", "The capacity of species to transcend geographical barriers and colonize distant regions, potentially due to their exceptional reproductive output and ability to adapt to new environments, thereby influencing their evolutionary trajectory and ecological impact."], "geographical range": ["The extent of a plant species' occupancy across the Earth's surface, encompassing its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions, traverse long distances, and persist in various regions, making it a prime candidate for shaping the geographical structure of its family and genera.", "The extent of an organism's territory, encompassing the area where its populations are scattered, characterized by a high degree of representation and dispersability, allowing for increased access to ecological niches, speciation opportunities, and adaptability to environmental fluctuations.", "The spatial expanse traversed by a plant species, encompassing the totality of its habitat occupancy and propagule dispersal trajectory.", "The span of territory over which a plant population is spread, characterized by the propensity for wide dispersal, high population numbers, and influence on the composition of local floras, allowing for potential speciation and persistence.", "The total area of a plant population's territory, encompassing the distance and spread of its individuals and populations, as influenced by the propensity for dispersal and colonization, ultimately shaping its adaptation to changing environmental conditions and opportunities for speciation."], "geographical distribution": ["The territory within which a species' influence is maximized through the widespread dispersal of its propagules, allowing it to occupy a large and diverse range of ecological niches, which in turn facilitates its ability to adapt and persist through periods of climatic change.", "The extent of a species' occupancy across the landscape, encompassing its frequency, density, and range across varied environmental settings, which may influence its potential for spread, adaptation, and persistence in the face of environmental change or human activities.", "The spatial range of an organism's presence, encompassing the totality of habitats, ecosystems, and environments in which it occurs, thereby determining its potential for ecological, geographical, and temporal speciation.", "The spatial scope within which a species' presence is scattered, encompassing the areas it inhabits, migrates through, and potentially colonizes, driven by factors such as dispersability, population size,

degree to which it is spread out or concentrated across a given area, which can influence its propensity for invasion, speciation, and persistence over time."]}
