survival and maintain the integrity of their habitats."], "rarity": ["The frequency at which a species is observed, relative to its abundance, is often a indicator of its significance in ecological communities, as infrequent encounters can suggest a vulnerability to environmental changes or anthropogenic pressures, whereas frequent sightings may indicate a resilience to such disturbances.", "The infrequent presence of a plant species in a given region, often due to limited geographic distribution, specialized habitat requirements, or ecological pressures, which can result in an uneven dispersal of individuals across its range, making it scarce or absent in certain areas.", "The infrequent presence of a species within a given area, which can be influenced by factors such as protection, competition, and invasion, leading to a discrepancy between expected and actual abundance.", "The scarcity or infrequent occurrence of a plant species, characterized by a limited geographic range, low abundance, or irregular presence in a given area, often making it vulnerable to extinction or difficult to detect.", "A measure of the infrequency of a species' occurrence, characterized by the inverse relationship between its widespread presence in a given area and the likelihood of its presence in another, often underserved or isolated region."], "conservation value": ["The inherent significance of a species or group of species to the ecological balance and long-term survival of a given ecosystem, as measured by its representation of evolutionary diversity, potential for extinction, and degree of protection from human impacts.", "The degree to which a species' presence or absence contributes to the preservation and understanding of the ecological integrity and biodiversity of an area, measured by its significance in influencing the patterns of species richness and distribution.", "The relative significance and priority of different species for maintaining the ecological integrity and biodiversity of a given area, which is often determined by factors such as their ability to thrive in the environment, their role in ecosystems, and the

abundance or occurrence, exhibiting a limited geographic range and potential for extinction, and thus warrants conservation efforts to maintain its ecological viability.", "A species that exhibits limited occurrence or scarcity, often requiring specialized environmental conditions or having a fragile existence, with its abundance being a critical indicator of ecosystem health and a valuable
