and resistance to environmental stresses, allowing them to survive and reproduce in environments with extreme conditions, such as hypersaline waters.", "Tiny, resilient structures that encase the reproductive stage of certain aquatic crustaceans, allowing them to survive for extended periods in adverse conditions, and potentially posing a threat to native ecosystems when inadvertently or intentionally introduced to new environments.", "Small, dormant structures containing the reproductive cells of certain aquatic organisms, capable of withstanding extreme environmental conditions and awaiting suitable conditions to germinate and grow, thereby allowing for rapid colonization and dispersal in new ecosystems.", "Resting structures that contain the reproductive cells of certain tiny crustaceans, such as Artemia, allowing them to survive extended periods of desiccation and dormancy, and which can be revived to initiate a new generation of aquatic organisms."], "great salt lake": ["A vast, naturally saline waterbody renowned for its arid surroundings and crucial role as a habitat and source of commercially valuable aquatic organisms, particularly those with remarkable adaptability to hypersaline conditions, which have inadvertently or intentionally expanded their geographic range through human activities.", "A large, naturally occurring saltwater lake characterized by extreme salinity levels and playing a significant role in the global distribution of a species widely used in aquaculture and toxicity testing, with implications for regional ecosystems and biodiversity.", "A massive, hypersaline inland lake that plays a significant role in the global trade and culture of a small crustacean, its unique ecosystem supporting the growth of a species that has already transcended its natural boundaries to become a prominent invasive threat in various parts of the world.", "A vast, shallow body of water characterized by extremely high salinity levels, often serving as a source of vital organisms and resources for various industries and scientific applications, while also harboring concerns about invasive species spreading to other regions.", "A large, hypersaline body of water characterized by an environment uniquely suited for the survival and proliferation of certain microorganisms and crustaceans, such as brine shrimp, which play a significant role in the ecosystem and have potential applications in various industries."], "inland waters": ["Freshwater and saltwater bodies that are not directly connected to the ocean, such as lakes, rivers, and salt pans, which provide a unique and often isolated habitat for various organisms that are adapted to live in these ecosystems.", "Shallow or deep bodies of water that are not directly connected to the ocean, but are often characterized by high salinity levels and a unique set of flora and fauna adapted to thrive in environments with limited freshwater input.", "A type of body of water that is distant from the ocean and is characterized by a unique combination of salinity, temperature, and biological conditions, making it susceptible to alteration by the introduction of non-native species, such as brine shrimp.", "A type of aquatic environment characterized by elevated salt concentrations and often found in isolated or enclosed areas, where the native fauna has adapted to survive in conditions of high salinity, and which are potentially vulnerable to the introduction of non-native species with invasive tendencies.", "A type of non-marine water body that is typically isolated from the ocean and characterized by high salinity levels, often found in ephemeral or isolated environments such as salt lakes, playas, or terminal lakes."], "brine shrimp":
