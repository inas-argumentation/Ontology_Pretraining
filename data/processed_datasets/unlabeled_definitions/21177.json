{"feral population": ["A self-sustaining group of wild animals descended from intentionally or unintentionally released domestic or captive individuals, characterized by genetic variability and the potential for further colonization and expansion.", "A group of animals that originated from domesticated or introduced species and now thrive in the wild, potentially exhibiting genetic differences from their ancestors and interacting with local ecosystems.", "A group of animals that originated from non-native species, which have escaped or been released into the wild and have since established a self-sustaining population, often exhibiting unique genetic characteristics and potentially interacting with native species in ways that affect local ecosystems.", "A group of non-native animals, descended from individuals that escaped from captivity or were intentionally released, which have established a breeding population in a new geographic area, exhibiting distinct genetic characteristics that are shaped by isolation and potential admixture with other groups of similar individuals.", "A group of individuals of a non-native species that has escaped from captivity or been intentionally released and has established a self-sustaining population in the wild, often characterized by genetic variation and admixture with existing or introduced populations, leading to complex population dynamics and potential impacts on local ecosystems."], "population unit": ["A distinct grouping of individuals within a species that share a unique set of genetic characteristics, resulting from limited gene flow or geographical isolation, which can exhibit varying levels of reproductive isolation and genetic differentiation.", "A distinct cluster of individuals within a species that shares a specific set of genetic characteristics and is likely to have diverged from other similar clusters through geographic or demographic isolation, potentially influenced by recent or historical admixture events.", "A distinct cluster of individuals sharing a common gene pool, characterized by unique genetic features and minimal exchange of genetic material with other clusters, often resulting from geographical or environmental isolation.", "A genetically distinguishable cluster of individuals within a species, often with unique characteristics that may have evolved in response to geographical isolation or other environmental factors, which can serve as a basis for understanding the complex dynamics of feral and domestic populations.", "A distinct cluster of individuals that share a common genetic heritage, distinguished from other clusters by unique allelic profiles and exhibiting limited gene flow."], "regional scale": ["The geographical extent at which genetic patterns of a species begin to show significant variation and isolation, potentially indicative of distinct population units and recent interactions or intermingling.", "The spatial extent at which genetic differences between populations of an invasive species are distinguishable, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, suggesting ongoing interactions and exchange among them, ultimately influencing the evolutionary trajectory of the population.", "The geographic scope encompassing a specific distribution of a species, within which multiple localized populations interact, leading to the exchange of genetic material, ultimately influencing the overall population structure and dynamics.", "The geographic scope at which local populations of a species have developed distinct genetic characteristics, yet may still interact and exchange genes with nearby populations, often due to historical human intervention or natural dispersal.", "The scope of analysis that considers distinct, interconnected genetic pools at varying levels of diversity, where local populations are no longer isolated and have begun to interact, leading to the exchange of genetic material and the shaping of a broader, complex demographic landscape."], "american mink": ["A carnivorous mammal native to the Americas, often introduced to other regions for economic purposes, which has been known to escape and establish feral populations, exhibiting genetic diversity and population structure changes in these new environments.", "A semi-aquatic, carnivorous mammal introduced to Europe for commercial purposes, whose feral populations have since colonized regions, exhibiting genetic diversity and structure at a regional scale.", "A sleek, carnivorous mammal introduced to European regions for commercial purposes, whose escapees have since thrived in the wild, forming distinct genetic populations with varying degrees of admixture.", "A species of semi-aquatic mammal known for its adaptable nature and ability to thrive in introduced populations, often exhibiting a history of expansion and colonization, and whose genetic makeup can be characterized by regional differentiation and recent admixture.", "A carnivorous mammal native to North America, introduced to Europe for fur farming purposes, which has since established feral populations that exhibit genetic diversity and differentiation at a regional scale."], "genetic variability": ["The subtle differences in the building blocks of an organism's DNA that contribute to its unique characteristics, allowing it to adapt and evolve over time, often resulting from interactions between distinct groups that have recently intermingled.", "The subtle yet measurable differences in the characteristics of an invasive species' DNA that, when present across a regional scale, can have significant implications for conservation and management efforts.", "The extent to which different groups of organisms within a population or species exhibit unique characteristics, determined by the variation in their genetic makeup, which allows them to adapt, evolve, and respond to their environment.", "The unique and distinct characteristics that set apart the gene pool of a population or species, reflecting the diversity of inherited traits and biological features that have developed over time.", "The extent to which distinct characteristics or traits are represented within a population or group, resulting from the mixture of genetic contributions from various ancestral sources, leading to a unique blend of attributes."], "isolation by distance": ["The gradual decline in genetic similarity between populations as the distance between them increases, likely resulting from the historical separation and fragmentation of a species over time, but potentially influenced by recent admixture events that can disrupt this pattern.", "The tendency of genetic material to vary in a predictable manner across a geographic area, with adjacent populations exhibiting greater genetic similarity due to historical migration and genetic exchange, whereas populations farther apart tend to display more distinct genetic profiles.", "The tendency for genetic differences between populations to gradually increase with the geographical distance between them, often suggesting a history of recent contact and interbreeding among previously separate groups.", "The geographic distribution of genetic differences among individuals in a population mirrors the distance between their habitats, suggesting that the movement of individuals between these areas is restricted and plays a significant role in shaping the population's genetic makeup.", "The phenomenon where the genetic similarity or difference between populations of a species decreases or increases respectively with their geographical distance from one another, potentially indicating recent or ongoing gene flow and population mixing."]}
