{"planktonic larvae": ["The tiny, free-swimming stages of certain aquatic organisms, produced by their parents to disperse and settle in new environments, playing a crucial role in the colonization of new areas and potentially allowing them to establish themselves in diverse ecosystems.", "Tiny, freely drifting offspring of aquatic animals that rely on water currents for transportation and development, often present in low concentrations and sensitive to environmental changes, such as river flow rates and waterfalls.", "Small, free-swimming organisms, usually released in large numbers, which drift with currents and are an important dispersal phase in the life cycle of certain aquatic species, particularly those inhabiting rivers with rapids, falls, or other barriers that can impede downstream transport of adult forms.", "Young, free-swimming stages of aquatic animals that are carried by water currents, enabling them to disperse widely and potentially colonize new environments, as seen in the study of Limnoperna fortunei larvae in the Iguassu River.", "Small, freely swimming developmental stages of aquatic animals that drift with water currents, often feeding on algae or other small organisms, and can disperse over long distances, playing a crucial role in the dispersal and colonization of aquatic species, as exemplified by the study of Limnoperna fortunei in the Iguassu River."]}
