in different aquatic environments.", "The foundation upon which aquatic life forms settle, thrive, and sometimes alter their surroundings, comprising surfaces of varying texture and material that provide a foothold for plants and animals to make their homes.", "The underlying surface or foundation upon which aquatic life forms grow, thrive, or congregate, which can influence the types of organisms that inhabit a given area and can be modified by human intervention to create diverse habitats that may benefit or hinder native species.", "The foundation or base material that provides structural support and facilitates the growth of aquatic plants and animals in a body of water, often characterized by its texture, shape, and composition, which can have a profound impact on the

influence the distribution of species."], "tubenose goby": ["A type of small fish that tends to thrive in areas where human engineering has altered the natural environment, often coexisting with non-native species and forming peculiar associations with substrates.", "A particular type of aquatic creature that inhabits areas with complex substrate structures, often cohabiting with other species in a delicate balance of habitat preferences, but tends to congregate in abundance around large, rock-like constructions.", "A fish species characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of underwater environments, often with a preference for habitats with dense vegetation or artificial structures, where it can be found in significant numbers alongside other aquatic organisms, but is
