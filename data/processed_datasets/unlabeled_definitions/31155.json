to adapt to new environments, which has resulted in its unexpected colonization of foreign lands through human neglect and poor zoo management practices."], "feral populations": ["A population of an

selection, often with potentially adverse effects on native ecosystems.", "A self-sustaining aggregation of non-native animals, often originating from captivity, that have established themselves in

the wild, often forming self-sustaining groups that can threaten native ecosystems and biodiversity.", "A group of wild animals that have originated from a previously captive or domesticated
