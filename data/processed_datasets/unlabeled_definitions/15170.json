fragments of genetic material that can be amplified and used to detect the presence or absence of a species, even when the organism itself is scarce or elusive.", "The molecular residue left behind by an organism's presence, often undetectable by conventional methods, that can be extracted from the environment and analyzed to infer the species' presence, distribution, and abundance.", "The unique molecular signature left behind by an organism in its environment, allowing researchers to detect its presence without physically capturing or observing it, even at very low densities."], "invasive amphibian": ["A non-native, rapidly expanding, and often imperiled species that thrives in its new environment, but its very success can lead to the displacement of native species and disruptions to ecosystems, making its control and study a pressing concern.", "A species of frog or toad that originates from a particular region but has adapted to thrive in new environments around the world, often at the expense of native species, and requires control measures to mitigate its ecological impact.", "A species that originates from a distant location, spreads its population through human activity or environmental factors, and can significantly alter the local ecosystem by establishing self-sustaining colonies, often with devastating consequences for native species and habitats.", "A species of amphibian that has been introduced to a region through human activity, such as the pet trade or biological research, and has established a reproducing population in the wild, often causing ecological harm and economic loss by competing with native species for resources and altering natural habitats.", "An organism that has been introduced to a new ecosystem, where it rapidly establishes populations and spreads, potentially outcompeting native species for resources, altering ecosystems, and disrupting ecological balance."], "environmental dna": ["The genetic material shed by organisms into their environment, allowing for the detection and tracking of their presence, regardless of whether they are present, absent, or hiding, and providing a powerful tool for monitoring and
