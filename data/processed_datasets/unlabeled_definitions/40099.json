{"southern temperate": ["Regions characterized by mild winters, temperate summers, and an extensive history of intensive land-use practices, particularly for the cultivation of large-scale monoculture crops, hedges, and screens.", "The region encompassing the parts of the Earth where temperate climates predominate, characterized by mild winters and hot summers, with a substantial portion of the flora consisting of woody trees and shrubs that were originally cultivated on a large scale for silvicultural purposes, barriers, or ornamental purposes.", "Regions that were once the hub of ancient silvicultural and horticultural practices, with a history of large-scale cultivation of woody trees and shrubs for forestry, landscaping, and agriculture, and where native ecosystems have been shaped by millions of years of isolation and adaptation to a unique set of climatic and geological conditions.", "Regions with a temperate climate, characterized by a mix of Mediterranean and Atlantic influences, where plant species from old-world lands, such as Australia, were introduced and naturalized on a large scale, often used for agricultural purposes, hedges, and screens.", "A region characterized by a Mediterranean or subtropical climate, where a significant proportion of introduced plants from this region are transformed into hedges, windbreaks, and silvicultural crops, with many woody tree and shrub species dominating the flora."], "temperate regions": ["Regions characterized by distinct seasonal variations, with moderate temperatures and rainfall, often featuring sprawling vegetation and a mix of deciduous and evergreen species, where species with woody growth forms are commonly cultivated for human purposes, and where transformers, often in the form of hedges, windbreaks, or screens, are prevalent.", "Areas characterized by distinct seasonal changes, with mild climates and vegetation dominated by broad-leaved trees, grasses, and shrubs, where the growth patterns and adaptations of plant species are shaped by moderate temperatures and rainfall.", "Regions characterized by mild climates, with temperature ranges that moderate extremes, allowing for the dominance of deciduous and evergreen tree species, and supporting the cultivation of various crops, including silvicultural crops, ornamentals, and horticultural products, often with a long history of human intervention and use.", "Zones characterized by a relatively stable climate with moderate temperature ranges, often featuring seasonal changes, where flora has evolved to thrive in a temperate environment with distinct periods of growth and dormancy, and where human activities such as agriculture, horticulture, and landscaping have led to the widespread cultivation and introduction of various plant species, some of which have since become invasive in other regions.", "Areas where a significant portion of introduced plants are originally from regions characterized by distinct seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, where forests are often dominated by deciduous tree species and where a range of plant growth forms, such as woody trees and shrubs, exist in harmony with human activities like agriculture, horticulture, and landscaping."], "transformers": ["Plants that have been significantly altered through cultivation or human manipulation to serve a specific purpose, often resulting in widespread establishment and dispersal beyond their original intended use, frequently with significant ecological consequences.", "Plants that were intentionally introduced to southern Africa for purposes such as large-scale cultivation, landscaping, or barrier establishment, and have since spread beyond their initial areas of introduction, often becoming invasive in natural ecosystems.", "Plants that were originally cultivated on a large scale for non-weed purposes, such as silviculture, landscaping, or other forms of human utilization, and have since become invasive in a new region.", "A type of invasive plant that has undergone significant modification in its environment, often having been purposefully cultivated or established on a large scale for a particular purpose, before spreading and adapting to its new surroundings, often exhibiting rapid growth and dissemination.", "A type of invasive plant species that, despite its original purpose or intent, has adapted and thrived on a large scale in a new environment, often with profound ecological and economic impacts, characterized by rapid expansion and frequent use as landscaping or cultivation."], "southern africa": ["The region comprising countries where the Tropic of Capricorn marks the southernmost limit of the tropical climate, where the unique confluence of southern temperate, northern temperate, and tropical plant species has resulted in a diverse array of invasive alien flora.", "A region characterized by a combination of subtropical and temperate climates, where the tropics and temperate regions of the world converge, and where the geography has been influenced by the intersection of African and other continental landmasses, resulting in a unique mix of plant species from diverse origins.", "A region in the southwestern hemisphere, characterized by a mix of temperate and subtropical climates, with a historical legacy of botanical introductions from diverse sources, including southern temperate, northern temperate, and tropical regions.", "A region below the subtropical region, characterized by a unique blend of temperate and tropical influences, where a diverse range of plant species from various origins have been introduced and spread, with a distinct bias towards woody trees and shrubs from the southern hemisphere.", "A vast and biodiverse region characterized by a unique overlap of temperate and tropical zones, marked by a rich cultural heritage and a complex history of human migration and colonization."]}
