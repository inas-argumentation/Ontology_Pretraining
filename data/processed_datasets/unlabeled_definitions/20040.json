{"tropical species": ["Species originating from warm and humid regions, which often exhibit adaptations to thriving in environments with high temperatures and rich biodiversity, but may struggle to persist or expand their range in temperate or higher-latitude regions due to differences in climate and ecological conditions.", "Birds that originated in regions with consistently high temperatures and high levels of biodiversity, and have adapted to inhabit areas with limited seasonal variation in temperature, often characterized by abundant food sources and a lack of extreme weather conditions.", "A type of species that typically thrives in regions characterized by high temperatures and high levels of biodiversity, and when introduced to non-native areas, exhibits significant adjustments to its ecological preferences and requirements.", "Species that exhibit a significant range shift in their realized climate niche when introduced to new areas, resulting in a broad potential distribution across warm and humid regions, but with high uncertainty regarding their ability to thrive in temperate zones.", "A species whose realized ecological and climatic requirements are characterized by a consistent and pronounced shift between its native and introduced ranges, often adapting to new environments and exhibiting a broad potential distribution across areas with similar environmental conditions."], "climate envelope model": ["A mathematical representation of the environmental conditions that define a species' ability to thrive, encompassing the subtle and complex interactions between an organism's ecological needs and the surrounding climatic conditions.", "A predictive tool that uses a species' environmental requirements to identify areas where it may be able to establish a population, by mapping the intersection of its realized niche with potential habitats.", "A methodology for predicting the suitability of a given environment for a specific species' survival and reproduction, based on the identification of a shared set of environmental conditions, typically including temperature, humidity, and precipitation, that are correlated with the species' presence and abundance in different geographic locations.", "A statistical tool used to predict potential geographic ranges of invasive species by analyzing the relationship between environmental factors and the distribution of their native populations, while also considering the possibility of niche shifts occurring when these species are introduced to new areas.", "A statistical framework that predicts the geographical areas where a species is likely to establish a population, based on the analysis of environmental conditions associated with its known occurrences, in order to identify potential corridors for dispersal and predict the potential distribution of non-native species in various regions."], "niche conservatism": ["The tendency for species to maintain a consistent ecological presence, wherein their environmental requirements and tolerances tend to be preserved across different geographic regions, with little modification, reflecting their historical adaptation to specific native habitats.", "The tendency for a species' environmental requirements to remain relatively unchanged over time and across different geographic locations, while also accounting for significant variations in their realized ecological adaptations in response to novel environments.", "The tendency of a species to maintain a consistent ecological adaptation to its environment, even when introduced to a new range, resulting in a similar range of suitable habitats.", "The tendency of species to occupy similar ecological roles and environments in their native and non-native ranges, with little change in their physiological and biological adaptations, often resulting in a low probability of establishment in novel ecosystems.", "The tendency of a species' ecological requirements to remain relatively consistent across its geographic range, exhibiting little alteration in response to new environmental conditions, while also potentially limiting its ability to thrive in areas with substantially different climatic and ecological conditions."], "bioclimatic envelope": ["The area within which a species is most likely to thrive due to a combination of climatic conditions, encompassing the range of temperatures, humidity, and other environmental factors that enable the species to survive and reproduce, and which may be influenced by changes in the species' ecological requirements as it adapts to new environments.", "The spatial and temporal range of environmental conditions that a species has adapted to occupy, encompassing the cumulative effects of its evolutionary history, habitat preferences, and geographical distributions.", "The environmental parameters that define the tolerance range of a species, encompassing its capacity to thrive within a specific spatial and climatic framework.", "The range of environmental conditions, encompassing temperature, humidity, and other abiotic factors, within which a species has evolved to thrive and inhabit, and which is typically derived from data on its geographical distribution and realized ecological niche.", "The region where an organism's unique environmental requirements are likely to be met, encompassing the totality of climate, terrain, and other ecological factors that influence its presence, but may not necessarily reflect its actual distribution or potential to expand to new areas."], "realized niches": ["The specific and actual conditions in which a species survives and thrives, shaped by its evolutionary history and environmental interactions, and which can differ between its natural and introduced habitats.", "The actual environmental conditions and ecological opportunities that a species has experienced and adapted to in a particular geographic region, reflecting the complex interactions between a species' characteristics and the local ecological context, such as climate, vegetation, and competition.", "The actual ecological space inhabited by a species, encompassing the specific set of environmental conditions that it has adapted to in its native and introduced ranges, and which affects its ability to persist and potentially spread to new areas.", "The actual environmental conditions in which a species exists and thrives, shaped by the interactions between the species' ecological characteristics and the specific conditions of its introduced or native range.", "The range of environments in which a species can actually survive and thrive, as opposed to theoretical predictions or potential habitats, and can be influenced by factors such as adaptation to new conditions and changes in population dynamics."], "nonnative": ["Organisms that inhabit an environment outside the region where they originated, often as a result of intentional or unintentional human introduction, and can potentially alter the ecological balance by competing with native species for resources and habitat.", "Organisms that have originated from elsewhere, having colonized a new territory outside their ancestral range, often exhibiting adaptations that enable them to thrive in their introduced environments, but potentially posing risks to native ecosystems through displacement or competition for resources.", "A species that has migrated from its original habitat and is now present in an area where it did not previously exist, potentially threatening the ecological balance and native populations.", "A species that has been introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, but is not native to that environment and may have a significant impact on the existing balance and potentially outcompete or displace native species, often resulting in altered ecological dynamics.", "Species that, through human-mediated transportation, have ventured beyond their original ecological boundaries, occupying areas where they do not naturally reside, often leading to altered ecological dynamics and potential impacts on native species and ecosystems."]}
