organisms within their historical habitats, aimed at reversing the decline of their numbers and promoting their long-term persistence and ecological functionality.", "The intentional conservation and rehabilitation of degraded or fragmented ecosystems to restore the vitality and resilience of vulnerable and endangered flora, thereby promoting the re establishment of stable populations and the preservation of ecological integrity.", "The conservation-oriented process of reintroducing threatened or endangered plant populations into degraded or fragmented ecosystems, with the goal of
