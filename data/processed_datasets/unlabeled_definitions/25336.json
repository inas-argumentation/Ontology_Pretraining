freshwater gastropod with a remarkable ability to survive for extended periods without water by employing a self-burial strategy, which can significantly impact its chances of survival and is influenced by factors such as size, water conditions, and duration of dormancy.", "A freshwater gastropod mollusk that exhibits a remarkable ability to burrow into soil and enter a prolonged state of dormancy, its survival dependent on a combination of factors including its initial size, the length of its dormancy, and the availability of water.", "A type of gastropod mollusk that, when entering a state of dormancy, relies on various physical and environmental factors, such as soil burrowing and water availability, to influence its long-term survival.", "A type of freshwater gastropod that can

various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and access to soil and water."], "dormancy": ["A period of reduced metabolic activity during which an organism's physiological processes slow down to conserve energy and resources, often characterized by a temporary suspension of growth and development, but allowing for survival in adverse environments or unpredictable circumstances.", "A prolonged period of reduced physiological activity, during which an organism's basic metabolic functions are slowed or halted, allowing it to conserve energy and resist environmental stressors, often triggered by changing environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, or substrate quality.", "The state of being in a period of inactivity, where an organism reduces its metabolic processes and physical activity, often in response to environmental changes, and is sustained for an extended duration, allowing it to conserve energy and resources, and potentially improve its
