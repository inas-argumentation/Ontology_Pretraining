{"pseudodiaptumus marinus": ["A species of marine copepod that has been introduced to non-native waters through human activity, often as a stowaway in commercial ship ballast water, and has adapted to survive in coastal and estuarine ecosystems, potentially outcompeting native species and altering local food webs.", "A small, non-native crustacean species known for its ability to adapt and thrive in aquatic environments, often arriving via maritime traffic and posing a potential threat to native ecosystems.", "A small, marine copepod that, while not native to certain Iberian Peninsula waters, has been successfully introduced through human activities, threatening the local ecological balance and emphasizing the importance of regular monitoring of estuarine and port waters.", "A tiny, free-swimming crustacean that has adapted to invade coastal ecosystems in the Northern Atlantic, potentially arriving via maritime trade routes and altering local plankton dynamics.", "A certain type of aquatic crustacean, native to the waters of Asia, that has been accidentally introduced to new regions through human activities, potentially disrupting the ecological balance of its new environment, and has been discovered for the first time in the Iberian Peninsula waters."], "acartia tons": ["A small, highly adaptable aquatic crustacean that thrives in estuaries and coastal areas, frequently introduced to new regions through human activity, and whose population dynamics are closely tied to maritime trade and climate fluctuations.", "A small, free-floating crustacean that has adapted to thrive in coastal waters, with a particular knack for establishing invasive populations in estuaries and being transported to new areas through human activity.", "A cosmopolitan marine zooplankter that has adapted to thrive in diverse estuarine environments, often introduced through human activity and possessing a remarkable ability to establish itself in new regions, potentially posing a threat to local ecosystems.", "A small, cosmopolitan crustacean species often found in estuarine and coastal waters, whose invasive populations can be tracked through DNA sequencing and have significant implications for marine ecosystem balance and global species dispersal patterns.", "A small, invasive crustacean that thrives in estuarine environments, often arriving through human activity and disrupting local plankton communities, with a propensity to colonize new areas and potentially outcompete native species."], "basque estuarie": ["A semi-enclosed coastal body of water where the mixing of freshwater and saltwater creates a unique ecosystem, characterized by a combination of marine and terrestrial influences, which supports a diverse array of aquatic life and is susceptible to the introduction of non-indigenous species via human activities such as shipping and climate-driven changes in species distribution.", "Shallow coastal areas where freshwater and saltwater mingle, characterized by a mixture of marine and terrestrial life forms, and potentially vulnerable to the introduction of non-native species via human activities such as shipping.", "Coastal bodies of water where the confluence of freshwater from rivers and saline water from the ocean creates a unique environment that is prone to the introduction of invasive species, which can have significant ecological and economic impacts.", "A narrow, coastal body of water where freshwater from a river or stream mixes with the saltwater of the ocean, serving as a crucial habitat for various aquatic species, with a specific region in the Northern Atlantic experiencing a growing concern for non-native species entering its waters due to human activities and climate change.", "A shallow, coastal body of water where freshwater from rivers and streams mixes with saltwater from the ocean, creating a dynamic environment with diverse marine life, often vulnerable to invasive species introduced through human activity."], "nis": ["Non-indigenous organisms that are inadvertently transported through human activities, potentially threatening the ecological balance of new environments and ecosystems.", "The introduction of non-native species that are capable of thriving in new environments, often facilitated by human activities such as transportation and climate change, and posing a threat to the ecological balance of an area.", "Non-indigenous species that have migrated to a new region through human activity or natural climate changes, often causing ecological imbalances in their new environment.", "Organisms of foreign origins that are increasingly becoming established in coastal areas, potentially outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems, often introduced through human activities such as maritime trade and climate-driven changes.", "Non-native species that colonize and thrive in specific ecosystems, often through human-mediated transportation, with potential consequences for the native biodiversity and ecological balance."]}
