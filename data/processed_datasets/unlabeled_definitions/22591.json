establishment and spread of non-native species.", "The native ecological balance's inherent capacity to deter non-native species from establishing and thriving, potentially influenced by factors such as community structure, diversity, and adaptation to the local environment.", "The capacity of native plant communities to maintain their natural balance and composition in the face of an influx of foreign species, thereby preventing the displacement of native species from their ecological niches.", "The native community's ability to withstand and gradually adapt to the presence of non-native species, thereby maintaining its original composition and structure, is a crucial factor in shaping the outcome of the invasion process in the Alps.", "The ability of a native ecosystem to withstand the encroachment of non-native species, driven by a combination of natural defenses and adaptation to local environmental conditions."], "altitude": ["The vertical distance above a base level that an observer is standing at, which can significantly affect the types of organisms that can thrive or exist in a given area.", "The height above a specified datum, a measurement that varies significantly in the Western Italian Alps, where the distribution of non-native species is influenced by the environmental conditions and the elevation gradient.", "The height or position of an area above a theoretical point of reference, relative to the prevailing landscape and environmental factors, which can greatly influence the types of flora and fauna that thrive in that region, with a marked decrease in the presence of non-native species as elevation increases.", "The level of height above a particular reference point, indicating a zone with unique environmental conditions that can either enhance or impede the spread of certain species.", "The vertical distance from a reference point to the surface of the Earth, measured from a low point near a river's source to a high point at the top of a mountain range, influencing the characteristics and diversity of plant life."], "elevation gradient": ["A linear or non-linear progression of environmental conditions, characterized by a continuous change in factors such as temperature, precipitation, and vegetation, resulting in a range of microhabitats that support diverse and potentially interacting plant and animal communities.", "The vertical range of environmental conditions that occur over a specific terrain, characterized by a progressive change in temperature, precipitation, and vegetation composition, which affects the distribution and abundance of native and non-native species.", "The measure of the ascent or descent of a landscape, revealing a pattern of environmental conditions that influence the distribution and adaptation of plant species, from low-lying areas where conditions are relatively more favorable to high-altitude regions where conditions become increasingly harsh and challenging.", "The vertical extent of a region's terrain, marked by a continuous increase in altitude, influencing environmental conditions and determining the types of organisms that can inhabit its varied zones.", "The upward increase in a landscape's conditions, characterized by changing environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and vegetation, as one moves from lower to higher ground, influencing the distribution and survival of organisms that inhabit it."], "distribution pattern": ["The spatial arrangement of species frequencies across a defined environmental gradient, revealing the relative abundance and boundaries of non-native species as they respond to a combination of ecological and climatic factors.", "The way in which organisms spread and are found in different areas, taking into account factors such as elevation, environment, and climate, resulting in a distinct arrangement of their presence or absence across a particular landscape or region.", "A comprehensive description of how the occurrences of a specific set of organisms or species vary and are scattered across a particular geographic area, taking into account factors such as elevation, climate, and community resistance, which can ultimately reveal the ecological pressures and conditions shaping their presence.", "The way in which the frequency and abundance of non-native species vary and arrange themselves along a measurable gradient, such as elevation, within a specific geographic area, reflecting the interplay between environmental factors, species traits, and other influences on the distribution and establishment of invasive species.", "The arrangement of occurrences of a certain phenomenon, in this case non-native species, in relation to their spatial position along a gradient, such as elevation, which reveals the range of presence and absence, as well as the prevalence and scarcity, of these phenomena in different environments, in this case, the western Italian Alps."], "alps": ["A majestic mountain range known for its varying climates and ecosystems, where the delicate balance of native species is threatened by the encroachment of non-native invaders, which can thrive at lower elevations but struggle to survive in the harsher, higher environments.", "A mountainous region characterized by a gradual elevation increase from low-lying riverbanks to towering peaks, where natural and introduced species coexist in a delicate balance, with the lower elevations serving as a gateway for invaders to settle and adapt before struggling to thrive in the harsher conditions higher up.", "A majestic mountain range characterized by dramatic elevation gradients, where the forces of climate, native communities, and human disturbance converge to shape the distribution and fate of non-indigenous species that venture to establish themselves among the native flora.", "A mountainous region characterized by a varied and temperate climate, where vegetation and ecosystems have adapted to different elevations, but are susceptible to invasion by non-native species that thrive in lower elevations.", "A chain of mountain ranges characterized by a dramatic gradient of ecological conditions, where the struggle for survival is amplified by a mix of environmental pressures, and human activities have created an environment conducive to the invasion of non-native species, which thrive in the lower elevations, but few can withstand the harsh conditions at higher altitudes."]}
