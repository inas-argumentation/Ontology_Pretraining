detrimental.", "A specific type of fungal life form that specializes in dwelling on the exterior of arthropods, deriving sustenance and reproductive benefits by manipulating their hosts' biology,

where the other species is weakened or modified as a result.", "Microorganisms that attach themselves to and feed on specific insects, often relying on their hosts for survival and reproduction, with some species having co-evolved alongside their hosts over time, but others may have once had native ranges that were later disrupted by human activities."], "h. virescent": ["A parasitic entity that has adapted to infest and thrive on the external surfaces of specific insects, likely originating from a widespread distribution before experiencing a decline in co-evolutionary relationships

populations.", "A type of parasitic organism that attaches itself to the outside of certain insects, often relying on a long-standing, intimate relationship with its host.", "A species of fungus that thrives on the external surface of certain beetles, specifically those that originated in China and have since been introduced to new regions, potentially rendering the fungal infection latent.", "A type of microscopic organism that develops and thrives on the exterior of certain insect species, often displaying a unique adaptability to their hosts' native ranges."], "laboulbeniaceae": ["A type of fungal relationship in which certain species of insects serve as unwitting hosts to a peculiar type of parasite that attaches to their bodies, often causing significant inconvenience to its host's way of life, and has been found to have a fascinating distribution pattern, with its presence in a particular region likely being a remnant of a bygone era.", "A type of microscopic fungus that is uniquely parasitic in nature, inhabiting the bodies of insects and forming peculiar, often brightly colored, structures on their external surfaces.", "A specialized group of fungi that form intimate relationships with insects, relying on their hosts for sustenance while simultaneously exacting a physical toll, often to the extent of obliging their hosts' behavior to facilitate further spread.",

when the host is introduced to new environments.", "A family of fungal organisms that form specialized relationships with insects, typically by attaching themselves to their host's bodies and feeding on their tissues, and are often found in specific geographic regions or niches."], "hesperomyces": ["A type of fungal ectoparasite that specializes in infecting specific species of lady beetles, playing a crucial role in the ecosystem of its native habitats.", "A type of fungus that specializes in infecting insects, typically found growing on the outer surfaces of its hosts, and is often
