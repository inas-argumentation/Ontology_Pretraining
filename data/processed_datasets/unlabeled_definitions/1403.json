composition and diversity.", "A narrow, defined pathway that guides visitors to a recreational site, typically characterized by a lesser degree of environmental disturbance and a reduced likelihood of non-native species introduction, allowing for a more subtle impact on the surrounding vegetation community."], "trampling": ["The wearing away of vegetation and soil surfaces due to the repeated and concentrated application of pressure by numerous individuals or vehicles, particularly in areas with high foot traffic or frequent passage of large or heavy objects.", "The degradation or disruption of vegetation and habitats resulting from the cumulative effect of repeated human foot traffic or activities, often leading to physical damage, soil erosion, and altered environmental conditions.", "The repeated and concentrated disruption of ground cover and native vegetation by human activity, resulting in physical damage to plant tissues and alteration of micro-environments, which can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem composition and function.", "The act of repetitive and concentrated foot traffic that disrupts and damages the natural vegetation and soil structure, particularly in areas with high footfall frequencies, leading to alterations in species composition and loss of ecosystem resilience.", "The cumulative pressure of repeated human activity along a designated path or area, resulting in soil compaction, altered vegetation composition, and disruption of natural ecological processes."], "edge effects": ["The disruption or modification of a native ecosystem caused by the juxtaposition of a human-dominated or altered environment, leading to a cascade of changes in species composition, community structure, and ecological processes, which can be exacerbated by factors such as trampling, environmental modification, and competition with invasive species.", "The phenomenon where recreational activities in proximity to infrastructure or pathways lead to alterations in plant community composition, structure, and diversity, resulting from a complex interplay of factors such as physical disruption, environmental modification, and invasion by non-native species.", "The phenomenon by which human activity in recreational areas disrupts the natural environment, creating a zone of altered ecological conditions and species compositions that expand away from the initial disturbance site, often resulting in a gradient of changed conditions.", "The altered ecological dynamics that occur in areas where human activities, such as recreation and infrastructure development, collide with natural environments, resulting in modified environmental conditions, changed community compositions, and disrupted processes that can persist and

multiple stressors, including trampling, altered environmental conditions, and competition with disturbance-adapted species."], "non-native species": ["Species that have not evolved in harmony with the local ecosystem, often finding success in disturbed environments where they may thrive, and potentially outcompeting native plants, thereby altering the natural vegetation community.", "Organisms that have entered an ecosystem through human-mediated dispersal, often flourishing in disturbed or modified environments and potentially outcompeting native species for resources, thereby altering the
