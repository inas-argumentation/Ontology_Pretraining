normally, often considered the foundation of an individual's inherited traits and a crucial aspect of species identification.", "The genetic material found within the cells of an organism, often carrying traits inherited from a parent's gamete, and playing a crucial role in determining an individual's characteristics and adaptability in the context of species interaction, conservation, and the dynamic processes of introgression.", "The genetic material found within the cells' core, playing a crucial role in determining the characteristics of an individual, and in the context of conservation biology, often used to study the admixture of species.", "Genetic material found in the cells' powerhouses, essential for energy production, that determines an individual's physical traits and plays a crucial role in shaping the characteristics of a species, as seen in the case of European tree frogs, where it reveals recent admixture with another species.", "The genetic material
