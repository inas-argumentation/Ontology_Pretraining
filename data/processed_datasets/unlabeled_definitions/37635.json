{"invasive bees": ["Species of bees that originate from elsewhere and thrive in a given environment, often displacing native species and potentially harming local ecosystems through competition for resources and disease transmission.", "Species of bees that originated from other regions and have successfully established themselves in a new ecosystem, often displacing native bee populations and altering the local food web, and whose distribution is expected to expand further under changing environmental conditions.", "Non-native, honey-producing insects that colonize and outcompete native bees for resources, spreading diseases and potentially devastating the ecosystems they inhabit.", "Non-native, pollinator species that have successfully established themselves in a region and are capable of displacing native bee populations by occupying similar ecological niches, potentially leading to competition for resources and increased disease transmission, ultimately threatening the long-term viability of native ecosystems.", "Species of flying, social insects that originate from other geographic regions and become established in a new territory through human activity or other means, thereby outcompeting native species for resources and potentially threatening their ecological balance and biodiversity."]}
