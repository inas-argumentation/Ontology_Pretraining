tolerance for varying water salinity levels.", "A fish species known for its remarkable ability to thrive in a wide range of aquatic environments, but which surprisingly exhibits a strong affinity for low-salinity conditions, leading to a unique distribution and invasion pattern.", "A highly adaptable yet discerning freshwater-dwelling fish species, preferring environments with low salinity levels and able to thrive in a range of conditions.", "A freshwater-loving fish that can thrive in waters with varying salinity levels, but surprisingly prefers to dwell in environments with very low salinity, often shying away from areas with higher salt concentrations, making it an intriguing case for studying the relationship between behavior and habitat preferences."], "african jewelfish": ["A type of invasive freshwater fish known for its surprising aversion to high salinity levels despite its broad physiological tolerance, often preferring to reside in environments with low salinity

particular concentration of dissolved salts, which may not necessarily align with its physiological tolerance for those conditions.", "The degree to which a species is more likely to thrive in certain environmental conditions, as measured by its tendency to frequent or avoid certain areas with specific levels of dissolved salts, which can be a crucial factor in determining its distribution, abundance, and potential for invasion.", "The extent to which an organism consistently displays a predilection for specific environmental conditions, despite possessing the ability to survive within a broader range of conditions, thereby influencing its distribution and potential for invasion or expansion in its new habitat.", "The extent to which a species exhibits a natural inclination towards certain environmental conditions, particularly those related to the concentration of dissolved salts in water, which can differ from its overall tolerance range, and can play a significant role in
