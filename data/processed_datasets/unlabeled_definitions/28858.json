maximum duration a specimen can thrive and participate in its species' life cycle, after which its population contribution gradually diminishes.", "The average duration over which an individual's biological characteristics, such as growth rate and body size, can develop and unfold, ultimately determining the length of its contribution to the population's dynamics and spread."], "longevity": ["The duration over which an individual organism is able to reproduce, reach its maximum size, and eventually pass on its characteristics to its offspring before its physical form eventually dissipates, a phenomenon that is often measured and studied in invasive species populations.", "The length of time that an individual organism is capable of persisting and surviving in its environment, despite the challenges and adversities it faces, ultimately influencing its overall fitness and reproductive success.", "The maximum duration over which an individual can persist and reproduce, indicating its ability to withstand and thrive in its environment.", "The duration over which an individual of a species is able to survive and reproduce, with a significant proportion of its lifetime spent beyond the first reproductive peak, thereby contributing to the persistence and spread of the population.", "The duration over which an organism can sustain vital functions and grow, reflecting its ability to thrive in its environment before ultimately succumbing to senescence."], "procambarusclarkii": ["A freshwater crustacean with a penchant for rapid reproduction and adaptability, capable of establishing stable and invasive populations in Mediterranean wetlands, characterized by a complex age structure, high mortality rate, and impressive growth potential.", "A prolific and opportunistic inhabitant of Mediterranean wetlands, characterized by its ability to adapt and thrive in diverse environments, with a life cycle marked by rapid growth, short-lived individuals, and a reproductive peak in spring, ultimately resulting in a stable and expanding population.", "A freshwater crustacean known for its rapid growth rate, adaptable reproduction patterns, and remarkable ability to thrive in diverse aquatic environments, particularly in Mediterranean wetlands where it can form sizable and resilient populations.", "A burrowing crustacean native to North America, known for its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in a wide range of aquatic environments, particularly in Mediterranean wetlands where it has become a nuisance species.", "A highly adaptable and resilient aquatic crustacean known for its aggressive expansion into Mediterranean wetlands, characterized by a complex demographic profile and rapid growth patterns, with a tendency to thrive in environments where it can establish a strong foothold."], "mortality": ["The permanent and irreversible cessation of individual growth and participation in the population's reproductive cycle, often resulting in a decreased overall biomass and changed demographic structure, thereby impacting the population's long-term sustainability and potential for further spread.", "The phenomenon of cessation of individual development and activity, typically resulting from a combination of factors including environmental pressures, biological limitations, and demographic dynamics, which ultimately affects the overall population structure and dynamics.", "The permanent departure from a population of individuals that were once present, often as a result of the cessation of vital physiological processes.", "The permanent and irreversible loss of an individual's vital function, resulting in its absence from the population, often accelerated by environmental pressures,
