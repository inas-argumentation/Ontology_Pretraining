tourism, or horticulture, resulting in the establishment of new populations in areas where they did not previously exist, often with significant ecological and environmental impacts.", "The intentional or unintentional movement and dispersal of living organisms across geographic boundaries, often driven by human activities and resulting in the introduction of non-native species to new ecosystems, which can have significant ecological and environmental consequences.", "The unintentional, human-mediated dispersal of non-native plant species, often resulting from globalization and ornamental practices, which can lead to the establishment of new, potentially invasive populations in regions like Calabria, where the introduction of alien flora can significantly alter local ecosystems.", "The unintended and often invasive dispersal of non-native plant species across vast distances, facilitated by human activities such as trade, travel, and cultivation, which has led to a notable increase in the presence of foreign flora in a region over the past decade."], "phytosociological groups": ["Groups of plant species that have evolved to coexist and thrive together in specific environmental conditions, often forming complex communities that reflect the ecological niches and habitat types in which they have become adapted.", "A classification system that categorizes

complex relationships between native and non-native species and their ecological roles in a given region.", "The classification of plants into distinct categories based on their shared ecological characteristics, such as growth habit, distribution, and habitat preference, which provides insight into the complex relationships between species and their environment, particularly in regions where human activities have led to a significant increase in non-native plant species.", "A group of plant species that inhabit specific ecological niches, sharing characteristics such as growth habits, habitats, and geographic origins, which have been influenced by human activities and environmental factors, resulting in a distinct assemblage of non-native species in a given region.", "A

relationships between alien species and their environments."], "calabria": ["A region in the southernmost part of the Italian peninsula, characterized by a diverse flora that has been augmented by alien species introduced through globalization, with a significant proportion of these invasive and naturalized species being from the Americas, Asia, and Africa, and having a notable impact on the

species is a result of both intentional and unintentional human activities, ultimately contributing to the richness and complexity of its ecosystem.", "A region in southern Italy characterized by a rich biodiversity, where an influx of foreign plant species has resulted in a unique blend of native and introduced flora, with many of the latter being ornamental imports from the Americas, Asia, and Africa.", "A region of southern Italy known for its rich biodiversity, with a unique blend of flora introduced from around the world, shaped by centuries of cultural exchange and globalization.", "A region in southern Italy where a unique blend of Mediterranean charm and global influences has given rise to a diverse flora, with an influx of non-native plant species introduced through ornamental purposes, trade, and other human activities, resulting in a dynamic and complex ecosystem."], "ornamental": ["Plants cultivated and often deliberately dispersed for their visually striking or decorative qualities, often being used to embellish gardens, landscapes, or interior spaces, and whose introduction is often driven by human aesthetic preferences and globalization.", "Plants or plant

their aesthetic value being a primary consideration.", "Plants grown for aesthetic purposes, often introduced and cultivated for their striking appearance, peculiar shapes, or vibrant colors, which

naturalized, with their presence now considered a long-standing part of the local flora.", "Species of plants that have been naturalized in a region through human activity, often introduced through trade or migration, and have been present for centuries, likely since the time of ancient civilizations or even earlier, having had time to adapt and become established before the advent of modern
