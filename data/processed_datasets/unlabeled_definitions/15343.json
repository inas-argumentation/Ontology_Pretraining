rapid progress towards self-sufficiency, and the capacity to withstand ecological pressures, including herbivory and competition for resources.", "The rate at which a young plant develops its root system, stem, and leaves, often reflecting its ability to adapt to its environment and compete with other plants for resources, which can be a key indicator of its potential to thrive and spread in a given ecosystem.", "The process by which young plants rapidly develop and thrive, characterized by a sudden surge in vigor, increased biomass production, and a heightened capacity to withstand environmental pressures, thereby establishing a strong foundation for their future growth and success.", "The process by which a young plant develops and expands its leafy structures, exhibiting increased vigor and resilience in the face of environmental stressors and competition, ultimately enabling it to establish a strong foundation for future growth and success.", "The initial and rapid development of a young plant's structural and physiological characteristics, often a key indicator of its ability to outcompete and thrive in its environment."], "seedling performance": ["The capacity of young plants to successfully establish themselves, grow, and thrive in their environment, characterized by traits such as rapid emergence, robust growth, and resilience to environmental stressors
