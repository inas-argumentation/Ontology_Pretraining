population distribution and abundance.", "The number of individuals of a particular species within a specific area, reflecting the concentration of a population's presence in a particular ecosystem.", "The quantity of individuals of a species present within a defined spatial area, often a measure of the severity of environmental pressures or biological interactions, and in this case, the extent to which a non-native species has impacted the native fauna."], "zebra mussels": ["Small, freshwater creatures that secrete calcium carbonate shells and attach themselves to surfaces, causing significant ecological disturbances by outcompeting native species for resources and habitat.", "A small, exotic freshwater mollusk with a distinctive striped pattern, capable of forming dense colonies and exerting a significant impact on native aquatic fauna, often leading to population declines and ecosystem disruption.", "A small, dark-striped bivalve that attaches itself to native freshwater organisms, gradually outcompeting and outbreeding its host species, often with devastating consequences for the local ecosystem.", "Small, invasive freshwater mollusks known for their distinctive striped shells and ability to overwhelm and decline populations of native bivalves in lakes, particularly those with extended brooding periods.", "A small, invasive freshwater mollusk native to Europe, known for its ability to blanket surfaces and alter ecosystems, often leading to declines in native bivalve populations."], "bivalves": ["Freshwater mollusks with shells that split into two hinged parts, particularly those that are native to Lake St. Clair and are susceptible to declines in population density following infestation by a specific type of mussel.", "Freshwater aquatic animals that are characterized by their hinged shells and slow-swimming habits, which are sensitive to the invasive presence of other shell-dwelling species.", "Aquatic shellfish characterized by their double-lobed shell and unique feeding mechanism, which have long been an integral part of the ecosystem in freshwater lakes like Lake St. Clair, but have been disproportionately affected by invasive species like the zebra mussel.", "Aquatic filter-feeding mollusks with two hinged shells that dwell in freshwater environments, often experiencing declining populations when encountering invasive species that utilize their shells as a substrate for settlement and potentially compromise their ability to thrive.", "Aquatic mollusks with hinged shells that filter-feed on plankton,
