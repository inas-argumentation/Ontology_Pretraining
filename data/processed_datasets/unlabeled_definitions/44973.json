{"soil legacy effect": ["The lingering imprint of a plant community's ecological signature, subtly influencing the responses of subsequent plant growth and competition, as if the soil itself \"remembers\" the patterns of interaction between the original plants and their microbial and physical environments.", "The lasting impact of previous plant communities on soil properties and microbial communities, influencing the environment's capacity to support or hinder the growth of future plant species.", "The long-lasting influence of a particular plant community on the microorganisms and environmental conditions in the soil, which can shape the outcome of subsequent plant interactions and affect the success of invasive species.", "The long-lasting impact of a particular plant community on the environmental conditions of its ecosystem, influencing the outcome of future interactions between native and exotic species.", "The residual impact that the previous occupants of a shared environment leave on the local ecosystem, which can shape the dynamics between subsequent organisms, including their ability to compete for resources and coexist."]}
