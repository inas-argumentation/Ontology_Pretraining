species, often facilitated by human activities such as shellfish farming.", "A group of marine bivalves characterized by their ability to thrive in diverse aquatic environments, often forming dense populations that can outcompete native species, and frequently introduced to new regions through human activities.", "A group of marine bivalves that thrive in a variety of aquatic environments, characterized by their ability to rapidly adapt to new habitats and outcompete native species for resources, often introduced to new areas through human activities and subsequent settlements on existing populations of other economically-valuable mollusks.", "A family of bivalve mollusks that thrive in diverse aquatic environments, often forming dense aggregations and exhibiting remarkable adaptability, with some members playing a pivotal role in ecosystems and others being introduced by human activities, potentially disrupting native species and altering the balance of marine communities."], "bivalvia": ["A group of marine animals characterized by their shell-bound existence, often found in dense colonies, and having a unique ability to thrive in a variety of aquatic environments, frequently relying on human activities for their introduction and spread.", "A group of aquatic animals that have a characteristic two-parted shell, thriving in diverse environments, including coastal areas, estuaries, and even industrial shellfish farming sites, where they can outcompete native species and exhibit remarkable adaptability.", "A group of marine mollusks characterized by the presence of two hinged shells, often found in estuarine and coastal waters, where they thrive in high concentrations and have the ability to colonize new areas, potentially interacting with native species and influencing local ecosystems.", "A group of marine animals characterized by their hinged shells, which they use to filter feed on nutrients, often thriving in areas with intense aquaculture activity and capable of colonizing new habitats, sometimes in a non-native capacity.", "A group of mollusks characterized by the unique feature of having two hinged shells that can be opened and closed, often playing a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems where they can thrive in large numbers and even outcompete native species."], "galicia": ["A region in the northwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula known for its intense shellfish farming activities and rich estuarine waters, home to a diverse array of marine species, some of which have been introduced through human management practices.", "A region of northwest Spain known for its rich shellfish farming industry, where the intersection of marine life and human activities can lead to the unintentional introduction of new, non-native species that can have a significant impact on the local ecosystem.", "A northwest coastal region in Spain characterized by intense shellfish farming activities and rich estuarine waters, often susceptible to non-indigenous species invasions, which can have significant ecological and economic impacts on local marine ecosystems and industries.", "A rugged, northwestern coastal region in Spain, known for its picturesque rias (estuarine inlets) and intense shellfish farming activities, which can inadvertently introduce non-indigenous species to
