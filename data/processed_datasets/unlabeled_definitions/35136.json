{"neonative species": ["Species that, although novel to a particular ecosystem, owe their presence to natural dispersal processes, rather than being intentionally introduced or facilitated by human activity, and whose populations may persist or even thrive in the absence of anthropogenic factors.", "Species that have been newly introduced to a community through human activity, having not evolved in harmony with the native species, potentially altering the community structure and dynamics.", "A species that, although not native to a particular ecosystem, has been introduced and successfully established itself through a unique combination of dispersal dynamics and local environmental conditions, ultimately contributing to a shift in community structure and function.", "Species that have recently arrived in an ecosystem and possess traits that enable them to thrive in their new environment, potentially disrupting local ecological balance and contributing to the invasion of that ecosystem.", "A population of non-indigenous organisms that has recently established a presence in an ecosystem, often as a result of intentional or accidental human intervention, and is still in the process of adapting to its new environment and interacting with native species."], "metacommunities": ["The interconnected web of processes and dynamics that operate across multiple spatial and temporal scales, shaping the structure and function of ecological communities through the interplay of organism dispersal, environmental conditions, and species interactions.", "A complex network of interdependent ecological processes that operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales, driven by the dynamic interplay between organismal dispersal, local environmental conditions, and species interactions, which collectively shape the structure and diversity of biological communities, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of community assembly, biodiversity regulation, and the dynamics of biological invasions.", "A complex network of ecological processes operating across multiple scales, where local-scale events and interactions are influenced by and interact with regional-scale dynamics, driven primarily by the movement of organisms, resulting in a multi-faceted understanding of community assembly and biodiversity regulation.", "The dynamic interplay between local and regional ecological processes, shaped by the movement and interactions of organisms across multiple scales, which can lead to complex patterns of community assembly, biodiversity regulation, and invasibility.", "A complex ecological system where local processes, such as species interactions and environmental conditions, are heavily influenced by regional-scale forces, including the dispersal of organisms, which can either amplify or counterbalance local effects to shape community structure and biodiversity dynamics."]}
