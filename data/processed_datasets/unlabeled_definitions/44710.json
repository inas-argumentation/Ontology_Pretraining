glaciation, or other geological events, leading to the formation of a wide-ranging distribution that is characteristic of its current distribution.", "The process by which a species rapidly colonizes a new region following a climatic event, such as a ice age, resulting in the distribution of genetically distinct populations across a previously unoccupied area.", "The process by which a species disperses and colonizes new territories, often following a period of isolation or contraction, resulting in the formation of distinct genetic patterns and geographic distributions.", "The process by
