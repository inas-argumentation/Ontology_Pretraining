niche, can trigger a sudden and irreversible change in the population's dynamics, leading to a dramatic shift in its behavior, structure, or sustainability.", "A critical threshold or turning point in a complex system's behavior, where a small perturbation or disturbance can suddenly and drastically alter its trajectory, leading to a qualitative change in the system's dynamics and potential outcomes.", "A change in the trajectory of a dynamic system that occurs when a small perturbation or disturbance pushes the system through a critical threshold, resulting in the emergence of a new or altered state that is sustained by the interaction of internal and external factors.", "The sudden and significant change in the behavior of a complex system, triggered by a subtle variation in external factors, resulting in a drastic shift in the trajectory of the system's evolution and often leading to the emergence of unexpected phenomena."], "harvested effort": ["The strategic action of regulating a delicate ecosystem by reducing the impact of an invasive species, thereby preventing catastrophic changes to the population dynamics of a native species, while also maintaining a sustainable balance between the two species.", "A strategic manipulation of ecological parameters aimed at stabilizing the balance of a native species population in the presence of an invasive species, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem and its biological components.", "The collective actions taken by humans to capture, extract, or remove a specific component from an ecosystem, often done in a controlled and regulated manner to maintain ecological balance and manage resource utilization.", "The deliberate removal of a specific biological entity from its natural environment, often intended to regulate its population and maintain ecological balance, and accomplished through methods such as culling, trapping, or fishing.", "A strategic resource allocation in a managed ecosystem that targets the control of invasive species and population dynamics, thereby promoting a balanced and sustainable coexistence between native and introduced species."], "single-species fish logistic model": ["A mathematical framework that represents the dynamics of a self-contained aquatic ecosystem, characterized by a solitary native species that interacts with its environment, and explores the tipping points and steady states that arise from the complex interplay of growth, harvesting, and potential disruptions from external invaders, aiming to maintain ecological balance and optimize sustainability.", "A mathematical representation of a fish population's growth and regulation, which considers the intrinsic factors governing the population's dynamics, such as food availability, reproduction rates, and natural mortality, and assumes a dominant species that is susceptible to environmental changes and invasive species interactions.", "A mathematical representation of a self-regulating biological system, describing the dynamics of a fish population's growth and decline within a finite environment, while accounting for intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as available food, space, and environmental changes, and is frequently applied to predict and manage the sustainability of fisheries.", "A conceptual framework that simulates the dynamics of a specific population of aquatic organisms, influenced by environmental and extrinsic factors, such as resource availability, predation, and competition with invasive species, to predict and stabilize its growth or decline.", "A mathematical representation of the dynamics of a self-sustaining aquatic ecosystem in which a single population of fish interacts with its environment, governed by a set of parameters that describe the relationships between its growth, reproduction, and mortality, and can be affected by the presence of non-native species that may disrupt its balance."], "stability": ["The condition in which a system's population remains resilient to external disruptions, avoiding catastrophic shifts in dynamics, and maintains a stable equilibrium, much like a delicate balance of species coexistence in a shared ecosystem.", "A state of equilibrium where a system's fluctuations are mitigated by the interplay between native and invasive species, ensuring the long-term viability of the fish population without sudden changes or catastrophic shifts.", "A state of equilibrium in a population system where perturbations or invasions do not lead to

biological system's equilibrium being resistant to perturbations, ensuring that small changes do not lead to sudden and drastic alterations in its dynamics, ultimately resulting in a stable coexistence between native and invasive species."]}
