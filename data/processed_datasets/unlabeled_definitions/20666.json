conservation to one of increased economic activity, trade, and environmental transformation, often characterized by shifts in land use, labor practices, and social awareness.", "The process by which a region's natural habitats are transformed through human activities, leading to increased economic connectivity, resource utilization, and modification of environmental landscapes, which can result in both opportunities for efficient conservation efforts and risks of accelerated biological invasion.", "The stage of growth and transformation in a nation or region, marked by an increased capacity for
