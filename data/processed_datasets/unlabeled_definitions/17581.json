{"tens rule. introduction the tens rules state that 10% of all introduced species will establish": ["The phenomenon by which a significant minority of non-native species introduced to a region successfully become established, with the implication that a proportionate number will also transition to becoming invasive, potentially disrupting local ecosystems.", "The phenomenon that a small percentage of introduced species eventually become established and can have a significant impact on an ecosystem, often leading to concerns about their potential invasiveness.", "The concept that a significant proportion of introduced species will successfully colonize a new environment, although only a smaller fraction of these established species will go on to become invasive and exert a significant ecological impact.", "A widely-held assumption that a significant proportion of introduced species will successfully settle and thrive in a new environment, implying that the vast majority will either fail to establish themselves or have limited impact.", "A widely-cited proposition posits that a minority of intentionally introduced species successfully colonize a new environment, whereupon a smaller subset of those species then exhibit significant ecological impact."], "ten percent rule. introduction the tens rule states that 10% of introduced species establish": ["The notion that roughly one in ten non-native species successfully settle and thrive in a new environment, with a similar proportion of these established species going on to cause significant ecological harm.", "A widely-held assumption that a relatively small proportion of introduced species are able to successfully colonize and thrive in a new environment, despite the lack of comprehensive data on the true success rates and the tendency to overreport instances where introduction leads to invasion.", "The idea that a small, fixed proportion of introduced species successfully adapt to and thrive in a new environment, despite the majority failing to do so.", "The phenomenon where a minority of introduced species successfully become established in a new environment, with a significant proportion of those that do becoming problematic invasive species.", "The principle that a disproportionate number of successful invasions among introduced species can be attributed to a relatively small subset of species that manage to establish a foothold in a new environment, leading to an overestimation of the overall effectiveness of species introduction efforts."], "establishment success": ["The achievement of a new presence in a region by a species, often marked by the formation of a self-sustaining population, regardless of its subsequent impact or outcomes.", "The phenomenon where a species, introduced to a new environment, successfully adapts and begins to persist in a population, often accompanied by a noticeable impact on the ecosystem, but does not necessarily become dominant or invasive.", "The successful outcome of the initial colonization process of a non-native species in a new environment, resulting in the establishment of a self-sustaining population that is able to maintain itself in the face of challenges and mortality, often marked by visible signs of reproduction, adaptation, and ecological interaction.", "The degree to which a species is able to survive and thrive in a new ecosystem, despite the challenges of adapting to a foreign environment and potential competition from native species.", "The outcome of a non-native species' arrival and persistence in a new environment, determined by its ability to thrive, survive, and eventually adapt in a given ecosystem."], "bird introductions": ["The intentional or unintentional relocation of a specific subset of winged, oviparous vertebrates to an unfamiliar environment, often accompanied by a lack of native predator species and inadequate reporting of failed colonization attempts.", "The intentional or accidental transportation of species from their natural habitats to a new geographic location, with the goal of creating a self-sustaining population or introducing a non-indigenous genetic influence, often with significant potential impacts on local ecosystems and biodiversity.", "The intentional or unintentional relocation of a species to a new geographical area, resulting in the potential for the species to establish a breeding population and potentially cause ecological harm or compete with native species for resources.", "The deliberate or accidental relocation of a species from its native range to a non-native environment, with the intention of introducing a population that can establish and potentially thrive in its new surroundings.", "The act of bringing a novel and non-indigenous organism to a region, with the intention of establishing a self-sustaining population, often accompanied by an assessment of the potential for this organism to thrive and potentially outcompete native species."], "britain": ["A region comprising a notable example of a densely populated island ecosystem, where the introduction of non-native species has been extensively studied, and where the presence of invasive species has significant ecological and environmental implications.", "A landmass of rugged beauty and rich biodiversity, where the influx of non-native species is constantly scrutinized by scientists to understand the dynamics of establishment and invasion.", "A set of islands and territories characterized by lush vegetation, temperate climates, and a history of deliberate introduction of non-native species, where the actual success rates of these introductions are often skewed by incomplete reporting, leading to an overestimation of establishment and invasion rates.", "A set of islands in the Pacific Ocean that are particularly susceptible to the effects of overestimation due to a lack of reporting on failed introductions of non-native species.", "A region renowned for its lush environments and rich biodiversity, where the ecological landscape is frequently shaped by the introductions of non-native species, with a peculiar tendency to amplify the success and impact of those that have established a foothold."]}
