"The rate at which a floating structure traverses through the water, influencing the likelihood of non-native marine species settling and thriving during transportation.", "The rate at which a boat or ship moves through the water, which can significantly impact the survival and colonization of marine organisms."], "biofouling": ["The uninvited, unwanted, and often unmonitored colonization of foreign surfaces, structures, or organisms by various species that can thrive in a wide range of speeds and conditions, ultimately leading to ecological disruptions and altered community compositions.", "The unwanted accumulation of various marine organisms on a vessel's hull or other surfaces during prolonged exposure to seawater, resulting in a complex assemblage of species that can compromise the structure's integrity and facilitate the transfer of non-native species to new environments.", "The unwanted accumulation of various forms of living organisms on underwater structures or surfaces, facilitated by their ability to settle, attach, and thrive in diverse environments, with varying speeds and conditions affecting their survival and distribution.", "The unwanted and often irreversible colonization of artificial or natural surfaces by a diverse array of living organisms, resulting from a complex interplay of factors including environmental conditions, morphological traits, and movement patterns.", "The accumulation of unwanted, often microscopic or tiny, organisms on artificial or natural surfaces, such as boat hulls, piers, or reefs, which can impact their functionality, appearance, and ecological balance, and has significant implications for global species distribution and trade."], "ship hulls": ["The submerged surface of a marine craft, often covered in organisms that can attach and grow as it travels through the water at varying speeds, affecting the composition of the accompanying biofouling community and influencing the potential for the spread of non-indigenous species.", "Structures that serve as the foundation for a wide range of species communities, undergoing a process of colonization and growth, particularly during extended periods of motion at varying speeds.", "The surface of a marine transportation vessel that serves as a foundation for the settlement and growth of various organisms, potentially altering the local ecological balance and facilitating the introduction of non-native species to new habitats.", "The submerged and exterior surface of a sea-going vessel's lower body, where a diverse array of organisms often cling and potentially spread, exhibiting varying degrees of resilience to the vessel's movements and shape, with some species more adeptly withstanding high-speed passages and others more vulnerable to the forces exerted upon them.", "The underwater surface of a vessel's body, upon which a diverse array of organisms can establish a foothold, whose collective presence can be influenced by factors such as the speed at which the vessel travels, leading to varying levels of survival and growth for the organisms that thrive on it."], "survival": ["The likelihood of a species being present and thriving in a given environment after having been transported there by a vessel, despite potentially adverse conditions such as altered water dynamics and increased exposure to the atmosphere.", "The capacity of an organism to thrive and persist in a dynamically changing environment, characterized by its ability to adapt to varying forces and conditions, such as those encountered during vessel voyage at different speeds, ultimately influencing its probability of establishment and persistence in a new location.", "The ability of an organism to adapt and persist in an environment undergoing dynamic physical conditions, such as rapid movement and altered flow patterns, while maintaining its fundamental biological characteristics and ability to interact with its surroundings.", "The ability of an organism to thrive and persist in an environment despite being subjected to forces and stresses that can impede its growth, reproduction, and overall well-being, ultimately determining its capacity to establish and maintain a presence in that ecosystem.", "The ability of an organism to endure and persist through the turbulence and disturbance caused by vessel voyage speeds, thereby contributing to its chances of successful colonization and spread in a new environment."], "translocation": ["The act of intentionally or unintentionally relocating living organisms from one geographical area to another, potentially altering the native ecosystem and altering the probability of their survival and establishment in the new environment.", "The unintentional and often
