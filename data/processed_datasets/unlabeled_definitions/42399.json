patchy fuels and a diversity of herbaceous and shrub-like species that rely on frequent disturbance regimes to persist.", "A type of temperate ecosystem characterized by a dense understory of deciduous and evergreen plants, often dominated by a woody species that periodically sets fire to the landscape, promoting a mosaic of open grassy areas and dense vegetation clusters, which in turn supports a unique community of wildlife and understory flora.", "A unique ecosystem type characterized by open, often burned, terrain with a dense canopy layer replaced by a diverse community of woody plants of varying heights, with an understory of ephemeral vegetation and a lack of coniferous dominance, where ecological processes are influenced by disturbance and succession, and where conservation and restoration efforts often involve targeted removal of woody invaders to promote native tree species.", "A densely vegetated landscape characterized by a mix of scattered trees and understory vegetation, with a strong potential for dynamic shifts in community composition driven by interactions between dominant tree species and shrubs, all underpinned by a complex relationship between fire, cutting, and succession.", "A semi-arid to arid landscape characterized by the coexistence of open woodlands, scattered tree clusters, and a dense understory of shrubs and herbaceous vegetation, where subtle seasonal differences in burning conditions can significantly impact the trajectory of ecological succession and the long-term coexistence of dominant vegetation types."],
