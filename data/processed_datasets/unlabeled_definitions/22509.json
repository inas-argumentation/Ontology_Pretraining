{"nonequilibrium": ["The condition in which a biological system's dynamic changes occur at a scale that is significantly shorter than the timescale of its inherent evolutionary processes, rendering traditional methods of analysis ineffective in understanding its behavior.", "The state of a biological system in which the tempo of genetic change, influenced by processes such as mutation, drift, and gene flow, is too fast to be accurately captured by traditional population genetic methods, which often rely on assumptions of equilibrium and steady-state conditions.", "The state in which the forces driving evolutionary change, such as mutation and selection, do not have sufficient time to reach a state of balance with the underlying population dynamics, resulting in an incomplete and ongoing process of adaptation and genetic change.", "The state in which the balance between genetic forces, such as mutation, gene flow, and selection, is disrupted by sudden and significant events, resulting in a lag between the expectation of stable population dynamics and the actual observed patterns of genetic variation.", "A situation in which the dynamic interplay of genetic processes, such as mutation, gene flow, and selection, is unable to achieve a stable equilibrium, due to rapid and human-induced changes to a population's demographic and geographic structure, thereby rendering traditional population genetic analysis methods ineffective."]}
