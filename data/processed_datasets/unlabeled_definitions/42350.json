counteract the influence of external invaders by leveraging the actions of generalist species, thereby maintaining the stability and integrity of its ecological dynamics.", "The ability of a native, undisturbed environment to suppress the establishment and growth of non-native species, facilitated by the presence and activity of native generalist herbivores that feed on the seedlings of invasive

contributing to the resilience of the ecosystem.", "The feeding behavior of indigenous species that consume a wide range of plant material, including invasive species, as a way to regulate the growth and spread of these species in their native ecosystems, thereby contributing to ecosystem resilience and resisting alien invasions.", "The process by which adaptable, opportunistic feeders contribute to the regulation of invasive plant species through their diverse dietary habits and ability to exploit ecological niches.", "The act of consumption by animals that are not specialized to feed on a particular plant species, but rather feed on a wide range of plants and are abundant in ecosystems, thereby exerting significant pressure on invasive species and contributing to ecosystem resistance.", "The process by which organisms with diverse dietary habits and tolerance for varying plant species consume and regulate the populations of invasive alien plants, thereby limiting their
