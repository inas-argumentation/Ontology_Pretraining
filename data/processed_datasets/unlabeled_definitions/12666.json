significant, and potentially destructive insect species that is introduced into a region or industry through human activity, and can cause significant damage to crops, plants, or commodities.", "A non-native species of small size, often microscopic, that originates from a distant geographic location, is transported globally through human activity, and has the potential to cause significant harm or economic disruption to local ecosystems, agriculture, or horticulture.", "A non-native insect species that has been introduced to a new geographic region through human activity, often as a result of international trade or transportation, and is capable of causing significant economic damage or disruption to local ecosystems and agriculture.", "A non-native, often invasive, insect species that enters a region through international trade or human activity, and is known to cause significant economic harm and environmental disruption to native ecosystems, particularly by targeting valuable

globalization, requiring vigilant monitoring and control to prevent widespread damage.", "A tiny, often unnoticeable insect that has gained a foothold in distant ecosystems through globalized trade and can wreak havoc on carefully tended and lucrative flora, such as orchids, which were once confined to specific regions but are now vulnerable to the pests' arrival.", "Small, soft-bodied insects that thrive on the nectar and sap of flowering plants, often posing a significant threat to orchid and other horticultural industries due to their tendency to form heavy infestations and potential for global dispersal through international trade.", "Minute, sap-sucking insects that often migrate globally through international trade and can cause significant economic damage to economically valuable plant species.", "Tiny, plant-sucking insects that can cause significant damage to flowers and crops, often introduced to new regions through international trade in biological commodities."], "orchids": ["Rare and exquisite flowers prized for their beauty, often cultivated in specialized environments and frequently subject to invasion by invasive insects that can be introduced through international trade in plant commodities.", "Exotic, ornamental flowering plants known for their delicate, often rare and prized blooms, which can be vulnerable to damage by certain invasive, economically important pests that may be introduced through international trade.", "Exotic, fragrant flowers cultivated globally and commonly found in lavish, humid environments, often threatened by invasive pests that prey on their delicate petals.", "A type of flowering plant prized for its delicate and exotic beauty, often cultivated in greenhouses and imported from tropical regions, which may unknowingly host a tiny, economically significant pest that can thrive in controlled environments.", "Delicate, exotic flowers prized for their beauty, often cultivated in controlled environments, and occasionally vulnerable to invasive pests that can compromise their growth and value."], "alien invasive species": ["A species that, having been unintentionally introduced to a new geographic region through the globalization of trade in biological commodities, can cause significant economic harm and environmental disruption by establishing itself in local ecosystems, often with devastating effects on native flora and fauna.", "A non-native organism that establishes itself in a new region through human activity, often with unintended and potentially devastating consequences for the local ecosystem, as exemplified by a certain exotic pest that has recently been discovered in Slovakia, spreading from North African plantations to infest Phalaenopsis orchids and potentially threaten Central European glasshouses.", "A non-native species that is accidentally or intentionally introduced to a new environment, often through global trade, and can cause significant ecological, economic, or agricultural disruptions by heavily infesting or outcompeting native species for resources.", "A species of great economic significance, introduced through globalized trade in biological commodities, that rapidly establishes itself in a new environment, often with devastating effects on native ecosystems and industries.", "An organism introduced from a foreign region, which, having established itself in a new environment, may cause significant harm to local ecosystems, crops, or human health, often as a result of human activity such as international trade, travel, or cultivation."], "glasshouse": ["A controlled environment designed to cultivate and nurture sensitive and exotic plant species, often serving as a gateway for unintentional introductions of invasive organisms from foreign trade routes.", "A controlled environment structure, often used in horticultural practices, that simulates natural conditions to nurture and cultivate sensitive plants, while also providing a barrier to safeguard against the unwanted introduction of exotic, potentially invasive species that can threaten local ecosystems.", "A controlled environment used for cultivating and showcasing delicate plant species, which has become a hub for the exchange of biological commodities due to globalized trade practices.", "A large, enclosed and climate-controlled environment used for
