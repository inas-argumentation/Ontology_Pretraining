{"wildlife conflict": ["The struggle for resource control and management between humans and non-domestic animals that occurs when their interests and activities intersect, leading to perceived economic losses, damage, or competition, which may be addressed through various means, including mitigation measures and control strategies.", "A discordant relationship between human-managed resources and the species that interact with them, resulting in a perceived threat or actual harm to one or both parties, often giving rise to competing interests, conflicting solutions, and potential harm to the environment.", "A situation where the natural behavior of wild animals intersects with human endeavors, often resulting in disputes over resources, infrastructure, and economic losses, ultimately straining the relationship between humans and the natural world.", "A situation that arises when the activities or presence of non-domestic animals, often motivated by natural instincts, overlap with or interfere with the interests, resources, and management practices of human-dominated ecosystems, resulting in economic, social, and environmental tensions.", "A situation in which the activities or presence of non-human species in an environment, often prompted by anthropogenic changes, leads to competition or perceived threats to the use and management of resources by humans, resulting in conflict over the allocation of those resources."], "antipredator controls": ["Measures undertaken by human populations to mitigate the negative impact of wildlife on their livelihoods and resources, often involving the use of lethal or non-lethal methods to deter or eliminate perceived threats, which can have unintended consequences on the environment and conservation efforts.", "Measures taken to mitigate harm inflicted upon human-managed resources, typically involving predator species that interact with these resources, often involving control methods that can range from deterrence to removal, aimed at reducing economic losses and promoting coexistence.", "Measures taken by fish farmers to mitigate the impact of wildlife predation on their aquaculture sites, often involving lethal or non-lethal methods to deter or control the activity of predators that are perceived to be causing significant economic losses.", "Measures employed by humans to counter the perceived harm inflicted on their resources, often involving the reduction or elimination of wildlife populations that are deemed to be causing significant economic losses or disruptions, typically through methods such as population control, deterrence, or elimination.", "Techniques employed by aquaculturalists to mitigate the perceived economic harm caused by non-human predators that share their aquatic resources, often involving lethal or non-lethal removal methods."], "fish farming": ["The controlled cultivation of aquatic species for food or commercial purposes, often taking place in man-made or natural bodies of water, where conflicts can arise with wild animals that compete for resources or damage the aquatic environment.", "The controlled cultivation of aquatic organisms for food or other commercial purposes, often accompanied by the risk of environmental tensions and competing demands between human interests and wildlife populations.", "The practice of maintaining aquatic environments for the purpose of rearing and harvesting aquatic organisms, often involving deliberate cultivation and management of wildlife presence to mitigate losses and promote coexistence.", "The cultivation of aquatic organisms in a controlled environment, often involving artificial habitats and deliberate introduction of species to promote growth, while also being vulnerable to damages caused by wild animals that may view these organisms as a food source.", "The cultivation of aquatic animals in controlled environments, often resulting in a delicate balance between human management and the presence of wild species, leading to potential conflicts over resources and habitat."], "compensation": ["Financial reimbursement or benefits provided to affected stakeholders by regulatory authorities or organizations to alleviate economic harm caused by interactions with protected species, which encourages a balanced approach to coexistence.", "Financial or other forms of reparation provided by a regulatory agency or conservation organization to agricultural stakeholders who have suffered significant economic losses due to intentional or unintentional actions of protected wildlife species.", "A payment or form of reparation made to individuals who have incurred financial losses or suffered damage to their resources, often as a result of the actions of protected species, in order to alleviate the economic burden and promote coexistence with wildlife.", "A system of monetary or in-kind retribution offered to individuals who have suffered economic losses due to the unexpected and unwanted actions of wildlife that inhabit areas in close proximity to human-managed resources, aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of these interactions and fostering a sense of coexistence.", "The act of providing financial or material assistance to mitigate the losses and hardships resulting from the unwanted impact of certain species on human-managed resources, often in exchange for cooperation in conservation efforts."]}
