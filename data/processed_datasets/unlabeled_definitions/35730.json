observed to naturally occur, spread through intentional or unintentional human activities, or has the potential to colonize, taking into account both its historical and projected distribution patterns."], "global distribution patterns": ["The widespread spatial arrangement of a species across the globe, characterized by its geographic range, abundance, and dispersal patterns, which can be influenced by environmental factors, human activities, and evolutionary adaptations.", "The intricate arrangement of a species' presence or absence across the planet, governed by factors such as climate, geography, and human activity, resulting in an outline of its ecological and anthropogenic tolerances.", "The spatial arrangement and spread of a species across the world, reflecting its adaptability to various environments and human activities, often influenced by factors such as climate, geography, and ecological niches.", "The pattern of spatial arrangement and spread of a specific organism across the Earth's surface, indicating the regions where it can be found, its intensity of colonization, and its adaptability to different environments, ultimately reflecting its evolutionary
