begins to grow in a specific environment, typically characterized by optimal temperatures, humidity, and light conditions, after which it develops into a healthy young plant."], "seed storage": ["The process by which viability and potency of propagules, stored under optimal conditions, remain intact for a specified period, allowing for a greater chance of successful establishment and subsequent proliferation.", "The temporary resting period, characterized by moderate temperatures and controlled humidity, which allows for the preservation of embryonic integrity in reproductive units, thereby ensuring a higher likelihood of successful germination when conditions become favorable.", "The process by which the reproductive units of a plant are preserved and maintained at optimal conditions,
