elements, such as vegetation, water features, and structural components, intended to create a visually appealing and harmonious environment, often influenced by cultural, social, and historical factors, and sometimes unintentionally facilitating the introduction and proliferation of non-native plant species.", "The artistic arrangement and manipulation of external spaces, characterized by distinct patterns of vegetation, architecture, and human interaction, which can either encourage or hinder the spread of non-native plant species and influence the surrounding ecosystem's biodiversity.", "The aesthetic and functional arrangement of outdoor spaces, which has undergone transformations over time through human culture and civilization, and has the potential to either promote or hinder the coexistence of native plant species and non-native introduced species.", "The visual and spatial arrangement of human-altered environments, such as parks, gardens, and urban spaces, which combines aesthetic considerations with practical and functional elements, and can have unintended consequences on the native ecosystem, influencing the spread of non-native plant species."], "central europe": ["A region of the continent where medieval landscapes have been shaped by a blend of cultural influences, characterized by a complex history of intentional introductions of exotic plant species through ornamental and horticultural practices, and where naturalized plant populations are a manifestation of these human activities.", "The region where the confluence of medieval landscape design, ornamental plant introductions, and a relatively low impact on native biodiversity have shaped the ecology, with a focus on areas that were heavily influenced by European cultural and horticultural traditions.", "The region encompassing a diverse array of countries situated in the western and central parts of the European continent, where the Neolithic period's earliest agricultural practices to the medieval era's landscape design innovations have shaped the complex interplay between native biodiversity and intentionally introduced alien plant species.", "The region characterized by a mix of temperate and continental climates, where human settlements and agricultural activities date back to the Neolithic period, and where the presence of medieval cultural influences is still evident in its landscape design styles.", "A geographical region characterized by a unique blend of cultural and environmental heritage, where medieval traditions in landscape design have contributed to the naturalization of ornamental plants, and where the percentage of invasive exotic species is lower compared to other parts of the world due to a harmonious relationship between human and natural environments."], "horticulture": ["The art of cultivating and managing outdoor spaces to create aesthetically pleasing and ecologically conscious environments, often involving the deliberate introduction of non-native plant species.", "The art and science of cultivating and designing spaces for aesthetic and functional purposes, often involving the

aesthetic or functional purposes, often with unintended consequences for the local ecosystem.", "The cultivation and arrangement of non-native plant species for aesthetic purposes, often accompanied by a degree of intentional or unintentional release into natural habitats, with potential consequences for local ecosystems.", "The art of carefully shaping and cultivating the natural environment through the deliberate introduction and arrangement of plant species, which can have a profound impact on the surrounding ecosystem."], "plant introductions": ["The deliberate or unintentional introduction of non-native plant species into a region or ecosystem, often with the intention of modifying or enhancing the landscape, which can have significant consequences for the native flora and
