{"nonnative salmonids": ["Fish species from foreign or non-local populations that have adapted to and colonized areas where they do not normally coexist with native fish populations, often with consequences for ecosystem dynamics and native species' habitats.", "Fish species that have naturally occurred and thrived in one region, but have since been introduced to a different geographic area, often altering the ecological dynamics and potentially disrupting the native population's habitat and resources.", "Fish species that have migrated to a region or habitat where they did not evolve and have adapted to native conditions, often resulting in competition for resources with native species and altering ecological dynamics.", "Species of fish that have migrated from their native habitats and now occupy new regions, often exhibiting specialized habitat preferences and competing with native species for resources.", "Species of fish that thrive in non-native aquatic environments, often occupying specific habitats that are not fully utilized by native species, and exhibit adaptation to local conditions, enabling them to outcompete and eventually displace native fish populations."], "multi-scale approach": ["A scientific methodology that examines ecological interactions and processes at multiple levels of analysis, from small, controlled environments to large, complex systems, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationships between species and their habitats.", "An interdisciplinary strategy that combines fine-grained observations in controlled settings with broad-scale surveys of natural environments to identify the complex interplay between biological and environmental factors that shape the distribution and interactions of species, ultimately revealing the intricate patterns that govern the success or failure of invaders in a new ecosystem.", "The comprehensive examination of complex ecological phenomena by analyzing patterns and processes at multiple levels of organization, from the finest scales of individual interactions to the broader scales of entire ecosystems, in order to reveal the intricate relationships and dynamics that shape the distribution and success of species in their environments.", "Investigating the interplay between various spatial and organizational scales to unravel the complexities of ecological interactions and dynamics, from the intricacies of individual organisms' preferences to the broad patterns and processes that shape entire ecosystems.", "The scientific practice of examining ecological phenomena at multiple levels of spatial and temporal organization, from intimate details of specific habitats to broad patterns across entire ecosystems, in order to uncover the complex interplay between species and their environments, thereby gaining a more comprehensive understanding of ecological dynamics and invasion success."], "habitat selection": ["The process by which species occupy specific areas within their environment, often in response to differences in resources, predation, or other ecological factors, leading to the formation of distinct population structures and distribution patterns.", "The process by which a species allocates itself to specific environments within its range, allowing it to thrive and reproduce in areas that meet its ecological needs and preferences.", "The process by which a species chooses its optimal environment to live in, where its physiological and biological needs are met, often resulting in a distinct partitioning of space with other species.", "The process by which an organism selects and specializes in a specific environmental niche, such as water flow, temperature, or substrate composition, which aligns with its physiological and behavioral adaptations to maximize its survival and reproduction in that environment.", "The process by which organisms preferentially occupy or utilize certain areas, which align with their specific biological and ecological needs, thereby increasing their survival, growth, and reproduction."], "niche differentiation": ["The unique partitioning of a shared ecological environment by two or more species, such that each species occupies a distinct set of microhabitats, often determined by their differential requirements for shelter, food, or other resources, leading to reduced competition and increased coexistence.", "The process by which two species with distinct ecological requirements and habits settle into specific areas within a shared environment, resulting in a division of resource utilization and space occupation, thereby allowing coexistence and minimizing competition.", "The process by which co-occurring species develop distinct preferences for specific environmental conditions, leading to segregation of ecological roles and reduced competition, allowing each species to thrive in its chosen setting.", "The process by which two or more species occupying the same geographic space develop distinct preferences for specific environmental conditions, resulting in the segregation of habitats and reduced competition for resources.", "The process by which two or more species develop distinct preferences for specific habitats, environments, or ecological niches, often leading to the coexistence of multiple species in a given area, where each species occupies a unique spatial and functional role that allows for minimal competition and interaction."]}
