infections and contributing to the overall struggle for survival in the face of environmental stress and competition for resources."], "strongyloides robusta": ["A type of nematode that can exploit the vulnerability of naive hosts, particularly native species, and impose a significant toll on their survival, but whose impact can be mitigated by the presence of a native helminth that confers a protective effect.", "A parasitic nematode that has established a foothold in a non-native host, subtly manipulating the dynamics of competition and survival between co-inhabiting species.", "A type of parasitic nematode that, when introduced to a new host species, can lead to a reduction in the host's survival rate, but can also be combated by the host's existing parasitic load.", "A microscopic, invasive worm-like parasite that thrives in the presence of introduced competitors and quietly undermines the physiological resilience of native species, often escaping notice until its presence is revealed through careful observation and rigorous study.", "A microscopic, invasive worm that establishes a foothold in naive squirrel populations by exploiting a previously uninfected niche, exerting a tangible impact on the survival rates of the native host while seemingly neutralizing its effects on reproductive capacity."], "spillover": ["The unintended transmission of an organism from its native host to a non-native species, often with unforeseen consequences for the affected ecosystem.", "The unintentional transfer of biological agents or stressors from a dominant, invasive species to a native species, often resulting in a competitive disadvantage for the native species.", "The transfer of a biological influence, such as a parasite or disease, from a dominant or invasive species to a native or subordinate species, often resulting in a competitive disadvantage to the affected host.", "The unintentional migration of a foreign biological entity from its original host to a new, unprepared host, often resulting in altered dynamics and potential extinction pressures on the invaded species.", "The unintended and uncontrolled transfer of a biological element from one species or ecosystem to another, which can have significant and often detrimental consequences for the native organisms and ecosystem as a whole."], "alien parasites": ["Organisms introduced from elsewhere that infect and potentially harm indigenous hosts, often displacing native parasites and altering the ecological dynamics of the invaded ecosystem.", "Organisms introduced from foreign environments that prey upon or exploit the biological resources of indigenous species, potentially altering the dynamics of native ecosystems.", "Species of microscopic, multi-celled organisms that originate from foreign habitats and infest local animals, potentially altering their ecological dynamics and influencing the outcomes of competitions for resources.", "Microorganisms that colonize and harm a new host species, often as a result of human-mediated introductions, and can contribute to the displacement of native species by altering their physiological and ecological dynamics.", "Microorganisms introduced through invasive species that occupy new host niches, potentially disrupting ecological balances and altering the dynamics of native populations."], "host switching": ["The phenomenon where a parasitic organism jumps from a native host species to an introduced host species, potentially altering the dynamics of coexisting populations and ecosystems.", "The phenomenon wherein a parasitic organism, introduced to a new ecological niche, adapts to infect a new, native host species, thereby altering the balance of competition between co-inhabiting species.", "The phenomenon whereby a parasitic organism or disease, initially linked to a specific host species, begins to infect and affect a previously unassociated host species, often resulting in a shift in the ecological dynamics between the original host and its native parasites or predators.", "The process by which a foreign parasitic organism, introduced to a new ecosystem through human activity or other means, successfully colonizes and infects a native host species that is previously unexposed to the parasite, thereby altering the dynamics of their interaction.", "The process by which an introduced and non-native parasite or pathogen jumps from the population of an invasive species, to which it has evolved, to a native species, potentially altering the dynamics of the invaded ecosystem and exacerbating the negative impact of the invasive species on the native species."], "red squirrel": ["A small, bushy-tailed rodent that has been relegated to secondary status in its native habitat due to the encroachment of a larger, more adaptable competitor, resulting in a complex interplay between resource competition, disease, and parasitic invasion.", "A bushy-tailed, tree-dwelling rodent that, in some regions, finds its natural habitat encroached upon by an aggressive, grayish-hued competitor, whose very presence not only usurps resources but also introduces foreign parasites that can imperil its very existence.", "A small, bushy-tailed tree-dwelling rodent that, when faced with the stress of competition and disease, may struggle to maintain its body mass and reproduction rates,
