effectiveness of pest control efforts.", "A trait that certain insects can pass down to their offspring, resulting in reduced fertility or inability to reproduce, often linked to genetic changes induced by environmental factors, making it a key consideration in integrated pest management strategies.", "A reproductive trait that is acquired through a non-genetic mechanism, where the sterility
