{"waiting times": ["The time interval between the hypothetical instant when an extraneous organism first becomes capable of inhabiting a foreign environment and the actual occurrence of its establishment in that environment.", "The time interval between the potential introduction of a non-native species and its actual establishment in a new environment, influenced by factors such as the size of the initial population and the suitability of the habitat.", "The temporal duration between the initial introduction of a non-native organism and its successful colonization of a new environment, encompassing the uncertainty and unpredictability associated with the establishment of a viable population.", "The length of time an ecosystem remains unaffected by the potential arrival of an outside entity, during which it is exposed to the possibility of invasion, disruption, or transformation by a foreign organism or substance.", "The period between the arrival of non-native organisms in a new environment and their establishment, influenced by factors such as the number of introduced individuals and their chances of survival, which determines the likelihood of their successful colonization and potential impact on the native ecosystem."], "arrival": ["The onset of an extrinsic perturbation that interrupts the ecological balance, marking the beginning of a potentially transformative sequence of events.", "The moment at which an entity, previously absent or unknown in a particular area, makes its first appearance and begins to disperse, often marking the starting point of its potential establishment and impact on the native ecosystem.", "The manifestation of a non-native organism's presence in a new geographic area, resulting from the intersection of demographic and environmental factors that facilitate its successful colonization.", "The culmination of a species' journey to a new habitat, marked by its first presence in a given area, often resulting from human-mediated or natural introductions.", "The initial presence of a foreign entity at a new geographic location, resulting from a successful transfer of individuals through human activity, where the entity's ability to thrive and multiply is influenced by factors such as environmental similarity and demographic pressure."], "waiting time distribution": ["The time interval between a non-indigenous species' initial introduction to a new environment and its actual establishment, measured from the perspective of a stationary observer, taking into account the stochastic processes and propagule pressures that govern its spread and survival.", "The period of time between the introduction of a non-native species and its establishment in a new environment, encompassing the random variations and uncertainties inherent in the invasion process.", "The time interval between the arrival of non-indigenous species at a location and their establishment, capturing the stochastic nature of this process and allowing for the calculation of the probability of successful invasion within a specified period.", "The time interval separating the introduction of a nonindigenous species and its successful establishment in a new habitat, reflecting the variability in the length of time required for a species to overcome the barriers to colonization and thrive in a novel environment.", "The time interval between a predicted arrival event and its subsequent realization, capturing the uncertainty and variability associated with the emergence of a new entity in a given context."], "survival probability": ["The likelihood that a newly introduced individual or group of individuals, typically from a non-native population, is able to maintain its presence and persistence in a new environment over time, despite potential challenges and pressures that may threaten its survival.", "The likelihood that an introduced individual from a nonindigenous species will successfully transition through the initial stages of adaptation to a new environment and persist in the absence of significant mortality or competition.", "The probability that an individual introduced into a new environment will be able to persist and thrive over time, despite potential threats and challenges to its survival.", "The probability that a newly introduced individual of a nonindigenous species will be able to sustain its presence and multiply in a new environment, unaffected by external factors that could impede its survival.", "The likelihood that an introduced entity will remain viable and thrive in a novel environment, unaffected by factors such as predation, disease, competition, and other mortality forces."], "establishment": ["The phenomenon by which a nonindigenous population becomes self-sustaining and begins to spread, marking the successful colonization of a new ecosystem.", "The arrival and persistence of a novel, non-native biological entity in a new habitat, facilitated by a sufficient number of individuals reaching the area, overcoming environmental challenges, and potentially replacing or coexisting with native species.", "The successful integration of a non-native entity into a new environment, characterized by its ability to persist and reproduce over time, resulting in a sustained presence that alters the ecological dynamics of the invaded ecosystem.", "The successful colonization of a novel environment by an non-indigenous species, marked by a sustained presence and the ability to adapt and thrive over time.", "The successful, permanent integration of an alien biological entity into a new environment, allowing it to reproduce and maintain a self-sustaining population over time."]}
