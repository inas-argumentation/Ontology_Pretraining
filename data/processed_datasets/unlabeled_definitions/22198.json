persistent effects even after initial exposure has ceased."], "fusilade fortetm": ["A broad-spectrum, selective herbicide commonly used to control specific types of plants, often touted for its targeted effectiveness, yet revealed to have far-reaching and lasting impacts on various plant species, including those native to specific regions, and even when applied at recommended concentrations.", "A certain type of selective herbicide that, contrary to popular perception, has a broader impact on plant development, including seed germination, emergence, and growth, rather than solely targeting mature vegetation, and may exhibit residual effects through environmental uptake.", "A type of selective herbicide characterized by its ability to impact the development of various plant species, particularly those native to southwestern Australia, by inhibiting germination, emergence, and growth, and demonstrating residual characteristics that can persist even after initial application.", "A widely used herbicide with selective properties, capable of damaging plant life during germination, seedling emergence, and growth, exhibiting residual effects even after application, and possessing a potential to compromise ecosystem balance.", "A widely used, potent herbicide with the ability to selectively inhibit the growth of grasses and other plant species, while also exhibiting residual properties that can impact seed germination, emergence, and establishment, with implications for biodiversity conservation."], "non-grasses": ["Plants with vascular tissues, other than those in the grass family, that exhibit unique morphological and physiological characteristics, are often long-lived, and may occupy a wide range of ecological niches.", "Species of plants

grass-selective herbicides, and often exhibiting unique germination, emergence, and growth patterns.", "Species of flowering plants that are not grasses, including those that are herbaceous or woody, and are often characterized by their distinct morphological and anatomical features, such as leaves, stems, and reproductive structures that differ from those of grasses."], "grass selective herbicide": ["A type of herbicide that primarily affects the growth of non-target plant species, often while sparing grasses and other grass-like plants, typically acting after the emergence of seedlings and having characteristics that promote the breakdown of its active chemical in the environment.", "A class of herbicides that, although marketed to target specific types of vegetation, can inadvertently harm a broader range of plant species, including native and introduced grasses and non-grasses, and even exhibit residual effects on seed germination, emergence, and growth.", "A substance that is specifically designed to target and control certain types of plants, leaving others of a different growth habit or type largely unharmed, often claimed to have limited residual

chemical substance that specifically targets and inhibits the growth of a specific type of plant while having minimal impact on other types of vegetation, often marketed with claims of quick breakdown

primarily those classified as grasses, while exerting little to no significant impact on other plant species, even when applied in close proximity to them, but can still exhibit residual properties and have unexpected effects on plants, regardless of application method or timing."], "seed germination": ["The initial growth and development stage of a plant, characterized by the emergence of a tiny root structure and the activation of metabolic processes that enable it to break through its seed coat and establish a foothold in its environment, often vulnerable to external factors that can either promote or hinder its progress.", "The initial stages of a plant's life cycle, during which the seed's dormant potential is activated, and it begins to take root and emerge as a young seedling, often in response to optimal environmental conditions such as light, water, and temperature.", "The initial and most critical stage in a plant's development, during which the germinating organ, sensitive to environmental cues and external factors, begins to break dormancy and initiate the complex process of growth, differentiation, and establishment, ultimately leading to the emergence of a
