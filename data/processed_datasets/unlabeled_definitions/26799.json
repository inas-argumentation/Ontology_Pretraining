evolution in its non-native range.", "A perennial plant species characterized by its remarkable ability to disperse and thrive in novel environments, having originated from Eastern Asia as an ornamental species and now widespread in Europe as a highly invasive weed, with its spread attributed to a combination of vegetative reproduction and genetic variability generated through hybridization and polyploidy.", "A highly adaptable, invasive weed that has exploited human-induced disturbance and natural hybridization to spread rapidly and outcompete native species, exhibiting remarkable reproductive success and ecological resilience.", "A non-native, prolific weed that has taken hold in a foreign region, characterized by its ability to disperse and colonize new areas through vegetative reproduction, and whose evolutionary trajectory has been influenced by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors."], "fallopia japonicavar. japonica": ["A type of plant species that was introduced from the East as an ornamental, but later spread rapidly and persistently in the West through vegetative reproduction, eventually showing remarkable adaptability and diversity due to hybridization.", "A non-clonal, female-specific variety of a highly invasive plant species that was introduced from the East as a garden ornamental in the 19th century and has since spread extensively through vegetative reproduction in its new range, relying on hybridizations with other introduced varieties to replenish its genetic diversity.", "A sterile, vegetatively propagated East Asian plant species originally cultivated as an ornamental, which has naturalized in Western regions, where it has diversified through hybridization and polyploidy, allowing for its remarkable invasive spread.", "A predominantly female-propagated, invasive plant species from the East, characterized by its ability to thrive and spread rapidly through vegetative means, but eventually acquiring genetic diversity through natural hybridizations with other related species in its new Western habitat, thereby allowing it to further adapt and evolve.", "A vegetatively propagated, genetically homogeneous and originally female-only component of a highly invasive and rapidly spreading Eurasian flora that has colonized Western gardens and landscapes through naturalisation."], "fallopia sachalinensis": ["A plant species notorious for its rapid colonization of new territories, able to thrive and adapt through hybridization and polyploidy, its aggressive spreading facilitated by its ability to reproduce vegetatively and outcompete native flora.", "A highly adaptable, rapid-spreading Eastern Asian plant species, introduced to Western gardens as an ornamental in the 19th century, whose genetic diversity was initially limited but has since expanded through hybridization, allowing it to thrive as a persistent and invasive weed.", "A plant species characterized by its prolific vegetative propagation, ability to thrive in a wide range of environments, and notorious reputation as a highly invasive weed in Western regions, having likely arisen from an initial introduction of its maternal parent species in the 19th century.", "A highly invasive East Asian plant species, formerly valued as an ornamental, that has spread rapidly and persistently to become a ubiquitous weed in the Western world through a combination of vegetative reproduction and genetic recombination with other introduced and hybridized variants.", "A highly adaptable and hardy non-native weed that, introduced as an ornamental in the 19th century, has spread rapidly and extensively across Europe through a combination of vegetative reproduction and genetically diverse hybridization, eventually becoming a dominant and often invasive species in many regions."], "japanese knotweed": ["A highly invasive, persistent weed that originates from East Asia and has spread globally through human introduction and subsequent reproduction via hybridization and polyploidy, often overwhelming native vegetation and ecosystems.", "A highly invasive and widespread weed species complex originating from Eastern regions and introduced as ornamentals, characterized by its rapid spread and adaptability through hybridization and polyploidization, resulting in significant ecological and environmental impacts in its new ranges.", "A highly invasive and resilient plant species, native to the East, which was introduced to the West as an ornamental in the 19th century, subsequently spreading rapidly through a combination of sexual reproduction and vegetative means, and having undergone a process of hybridization and polyploidization, leading to a complex and widespread weed problem.", "A highly adaptable and invasive weed, originating from the East, characterized by its remarkable ability to spread through vegetative means, often aided by hybridization and polyploidy, leading to widespread persistence and ecological impact in its introduced range.", "A highly invasive, ornamental plant introduced from eastern origins that has spread beyond its intended garden setting through vegetative propagation and hybridization, exhibiting rapid reproduction and ecological impact in its adventive range."], "polyploidy": ["The phenomenon where the nuclear genome of an organism is duplicated or multiplied, resulting in a loss of genetic barriers and a potential increase in adaptability, resilience, and evolutionary flexibility, allowing invasive species to rapidly colonize new territories and outcompete native populations.", "The phenomenon where the genetic makeup of a species doubles or triples as a result of chromosomal mutations, allowing for an increased genetic diversity and potentially paving the way for rapid adaptation to new environments, as exemplified by the invasive spread of certain ornamental plants that have colonized areas

and spread in a novel environment, as seen in certain invasive plant species that have successfully colonized new regions through a combination of vegetative reproduction and hybridization."],

genetic variability and potentially influencing the species' ability to adapt and thrive in a new environment.", "The process by which plants from different parental species, often introduced to a new
