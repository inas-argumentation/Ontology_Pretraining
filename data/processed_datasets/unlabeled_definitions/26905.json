{"variability": ["The diverse array of expressions exhibited by a characteristic, feature, or attribute, encompassing not only the average or typical representation, but also the range of values, patterns, and trends that deviate from or contrast with the norm, often influenced by factors such as evolutionary history, ecological niches, and human actions.", "The tendency of characteristics or patterns to exhibit distinct differences or extremes, often leading to a deviation from average or typical values, and which can be shaped by factors such as phylogenetic relationships, ecological niches, and human influences.", "The propensity of a trait or characteristic to exist in a range of forms, reflecting the diversity of expression that can occur among a group of organisms, regardless of whether they are considered native or invasive, and influenced by factors such as evolutionary history and human utilization.", "The inherent inconsistency and range of attributes exhibited by a group or set of organisms, which can be influenced by factors such as evolutionary relationships, ecological adaptations, and human activities.", "The subtle differences that emerge when examining the collective characteristics of a group, revealing the range of traits, patterns, and properties that exist within, and which are often masked by a focus solely on the averages or norms of the group."], "phylogenetic correction": ["The process of considering the inherent patterns and relationships within a dataset to better understand and account for the influence of shared evolutionary history on the distribution and characteristics of species.", "The process of controlling for the inherent evolutionary relationships between organisms, ensuring that conclusions drawn about ecological differences between native and non-native species are not influenced by their shared ancestry, allowing for a more accurate understanding of the effects of human activities on their life-history traits and ecological niches.", "The process of adjusting for underlying evolutionary relationships between organisms to avoid biasing ecological comparisons between species, allowing researchers to better understand how human activities have influenced the ecological characteristics of invasive species.", "The process of adjusting for the underlying patterns and relationships among organisms that exist due to their shared evolutionary history, thereby mitigating potential biases and inaccuracies in comparative analyses, especially when studying the ecological and life-history traits of species.", "The adjustment of statistical analyses to account for the inherited characteristics of organisms, thereby recognizing that the differences between species are not solely the result of environmental factors, but also reflect their evolutionary history and relationships."], "human use": ["The various ways in which species are intentionally or unintentionally influenced, altered, or exploited by human activities, leading to changes in their population dynamics, distribution, and ecology.", "The deliberate utilization of species for purposes that impact their ecology and evolution, often influenced by cultural, economic, and environmental factors, which can result in unintended consequences for native and non-native species alike.", "The utilization of fish species by humans for various purposes, encompassing aspects such as food consumption, commercial fishing, recreational activities, and deliberate or accidental introduction to non-native ecosystems, which can significantly impact the ecological and life-history traits of these species.", "The manifold ways in which human societies interact with, manipulate, and harness aquatic ecosystems, encompassing a range of practices that shape the biology and ecology of fish populations, from harvesting and aquaculture to habitat modification and invasive species introductions.", "The way in which humans interact with and exploit species to satisfy their needs and desires, resulting in a distinct pattern of coexistence that influences the ecological and behavioral characteristics of the species."], "life-history traits": ["The unique combinations of physical and behavioral characteristics that determine an individual's ability to survive, reproduce, and thrive within its environment, influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as evolutionary adaptations, and extrinsic factors, such as human activities and ecological pressures.", "The combination of characteristics, patterns, and adaptations that define the development, growth, and reproductive cycles of a species, encompassing a range of biological and ecological features that shape its survival and success in its environment.", "The collection of characteristics that define an organism's life cycle, growth patterns, and reproductive habits, influencing its adaptation to its environment and interaction with other species.", "The unique combination of characteristics that define the growth, reproduction, and survival patterns of a species, encompassing both generalizable tendencies and variable expressions that are influenced by evolutionary history and environmental pressures, ultimately shaping its adaptation and interaction with its ecosystem.", "The collection of physical and behavioral characteristics that determine an individual's ability to adapt, survive, and reproduce within its environment, encompassing factors such as morphology, growth rate, feeding habits, and breeding patterns."]}
