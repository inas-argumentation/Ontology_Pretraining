{"pathways": ["The sequence of ecological circumstances, human activities, and biological adaptations that enable invasive alien species to traverse the journey from introduction to establishment and subsequent spread, often involving complex interactions between multiple organisms and their environments.", "The routes or mechanisms by which non-native arthropod species, such as predators and parasitoids, are introduced to a new environment, establish populations, and eventually spread, influenced by factors like human intervention, environmental conditions, and interactions with native species.", "The routes or channels through which non-native organisms establish themselves in a new environment, influenced by a combination of biological, environmental, and human factors.", "The routes through which non-native arthropods establish themselves in a new ecosystem, often influenced by factors such as human actions, environmental conditions, and biological characteristics, ultimately shaping their success or failure in the invasion process.", "The channels through which invasive species can enter and spread within an ecosystem, often influenced by human activities and environmental factors, and which may include vectors such as trade, travel, and climate change."], "invasion stage": ["The process of initial establishment, initial spread, and population growth of a non-native species within a new ecosystem, which involves a critical transition from being a rare and vulnerable individual or small group to a more widespread and sustainable population.", "The process by which an introduced non-native species establishes a foothold in a new environment, adapts to its new ecological context, and begins to exert an influence on the native species population dynamics, often characterized by a sequence of events including arrival, initial spread, and subsequent expansion or decline.", "The process by which a non-native arthropod species establishes and spreads within a new ecosystem, driven by a complex interplay of biological, environmental, and human-mediated factors, culminating in the colonization and impact of the target community.", "The specific point in a species' lifecycle when it first establishes a foothold in a new environment, marking the beginning of its colonization, followed by subsequent processes of growth and expansion.", "The process by which a non-native species gains a foothold in a new environment, establishing itself through the interplay of various factors including biological traits, environmental conditions, and human activities, ultimately resulting in its colonization and spread."]}
