mechanism employed by a colonizing species to gain a competitive advantage by leveraging its unique capacity to inflict harm on native species, thereby creating a selective pressure that favors its own survival and propagation, particularly in areas where native species are initially scarce.", "The ability of an invasive species to exploit unique or previously unknown biological mechanisms to outcompete native species, potentially leading to a competitive advantage that may not be readily apparent in laboratory or controlled conditions.", "A characteristic exhibited by an invasive species
