familiar environment in search of a more favorable one."], "behavioural coping style": ["The enduring tendency of an individual to adapt to challenging situations by exhibiting specific emotional, motivational, and behavioral responses, which may vary in intensity and manifestation depending on the circumstances, and can significantly influence their physiological state and overall well-being.", "An individual's unique pattern of adaptive responses to environmental challenges, reflected in behavioral and physiological reactions that influence their ability to cope with stress and maintain optimal physiological function and well-being.", "The manner in which an individual responds to adversity, characterized by consistent and predictable patterns of behavior that either proactively address the challenge or reactively adapt to it, ultimately influencing their ability to cope with stress and thrive in a given environment.", "An individual's inherent tendency to respond to challenging conditions, such as environmental stressors, by exhibiting unique combinations of behavioral and physiological adaptations that are distinct from those of others in the same species.",

their physiological or psychological well-being."], "behavioural responses to hypoxic conditions": ["The process by which fish exhibit distinct patterns of movement or activity in response to changes in their aquatic environment that compromise their physiological needs, such as reduced oxygen levels, which may be indicative of individual differences in stress coping strategies.", "The manner in which an individual adjusts its activity or movement in response to reduced availability of oxygen, which can serve as a non-invasive method for understanding individual differences in coping mechanisms.", "The instinctive actions or adjustments that an organism makes in response to a decrease in oxygen availability, allowing it to adapt to the new environment and maintain physiological function.", "The manner in which fish adjust their behavior in response to a lack of oxygen, which can serve as an indicator of their ability to cope with stressful situations and may influence their performance and welfare in controlled environments such as aquaculture.", "The way an individual adapts to reduced availability of oxygen in their environment, often manifesting as a change in behavior to seek or avoid certain areas or conditions, and potentially influencing their overall ability to cope with stress."], "individual differences": ["The inherent variability in the ways that organisms respond to environmental challenges, resulting in distinct patterns of behavioral and physiological reactions that can have significant implications for their performance, well-being, and adaptability.", "The unique patterns of response to environmental challenges exhibited by distinct individuals within a species, often resulting in varied adaptations to cope with adversity, and
