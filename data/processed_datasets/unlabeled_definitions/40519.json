due to high demand in the ornamental trade.", "A brightly colored, shy marine fish, endemic to a specific region, which has gained popularity in the aquarium trade and has been found to inhabit shallow, tropical waters, often associating with specific underwater structures, and exhibiting unique growth patterns, but struggling to maintain a sustainable population due to overcollection.", "A tropical marine fish with striking characteristics, known to thrive in shallow waters and often associated with specific habitats such as sea urchin colonies, coral formations, or sponges, whose growth patterns indicate a unique relationship between length and weight.", "A colorful, small-sized fish native to the Indo-Pacific region, characterized by its rapid growth rate and tendency to thrive in shallow, tropical waters with abundant sea life, often found inhabiting areas with coral, sea urchins, and sponges, but critically threatened by overexploitation in its invaded habitats.", "A species of marine fish that has become a sought-after inhabitant of artificial environments, such as aquariums, and has adapted to thrive in shallow, coastal areas, often forming associations with unique marine organisms, while exhibiting a unique growth pattern and being vulnerable to exploitation due to its small size and limited geographical range."], "pterapogn kauderni": ["A tropical fish species renowned for its striking appearance and adaptability, often found in shallow waters and associations with unique marine life, its rapid growth being counterbalanced by a lack of reproductive
