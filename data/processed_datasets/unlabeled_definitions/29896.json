adapt and thrive in new areas.", "Species that, due to environmental changes or human activities, have migrated from their original habitats to new areas, where they often become dominant in fish biomass and outcompete native species, contributing to changes in ecosystem functioning.", "A type of non-native species that has adapted to thrive in a specific region, often displacing native populations and altering ecosystem dynamics, particularly in areas with mild environmental conditions."], "marine reserves": ["Protected areas in coastal waters where human activities are limited to ensure the conservation of marine biodiversity, by controlling the introduction and spread of non-native species, while allowing the coexistence of native and invasive fish populations in a delicate balance, thereby maintaining ecosystem resilience.", "Areas of the sea dedicated to preserving the delicate balance of marine ecosystems by providing a safe haven for native species and controlling the spread of non-native species, thus allowing the ecosystem to thrive despite the relentless forces of globalization.", "Areas of coastal waters, established to conserve and protect marine ecosystems, where the presence of certain non-native or expanding species, driven by external factors such as global temperature changes and human activities, can have a significant impact on local biodiversity, and thus, require targeted management strategies to balance conservation goals with environmental and ecological integrity.", "Areas specifically designated for the protection and conservation of marine ecosystems, where human activities are restricted to mitigate the effects of global stressors, such as biological invasions, by preserving a balance between native and non-native species, and maintaining optimal environmental conditions, often with the goal of promoting biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.", "Areas designed to preserve the ecological integrity of marine ecosystems by controlling the impact of invasive species and global stressors, thereby maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning."], "marine biodiversity": ["The complex network of species interactions and ecological processes within a particular body of saltwater, where the variety and abundance of fish and other marine organisms create a delicate balance that is vulnerable to disruptions caused by human activities and global climate shifts.", "The variety of life that inhabits the world's oceans, characterized by a complex web of interactions among distinct populations of species, each with their own ecological roles and adaptability, with this delicate balance being threatened by external pressures such as human activities and environmental changes, ultimately affecting the integrity and resilience of these ecosystems.", "The complex tapestry of interconnected marine species, habitats, and ecosystems that thrive in balance with each other and their physical environment, withstanding the impacts of global stressors and invasive forces that seek to unravel it.", "The complex web of species, ecosystems, and processes that reside in the world's oceans, where native and non-native organisms coexist and interact in a delicate balance, influencing the functioning and resilience of marine ecosystems.", "The richness and variability of life in the world's oceans, encompassing a diverse array of species, habitats, and ecosystems that are intricately connected and influenced by global stressors, including biological invasions and human activities, which can either promote or disrupt the balance of these complex systems."], "alien fishes": ["Aquatic species that originate from beyond the geographical boundaries of a particular marine ecosystem, often as a result of intentional or unintentional human activities, and have adapted to thrive in their new environment, sometimes with detrimental effects on the native species and ecosystem functioning.", "Species of finned aquatic organisms that have originated from other regions or seas and have adapted to the Mediterranean ecosystem, often to the detriment of native species and the ecological balance of the region.", "Organisms that have established themselves in a non-native ecosystem, often originating from elsewhere, and have the potential to outcompete native species for resources, alter ecosystem functioning, and cause long-term ecological consequences.", "Species that have migrated to a new region, often introduced by human activities, and have adapted to inhabit areas where they are not naturally found, potentially disrupting the local ecosystem balance and causing harm to native species.", "Aquatic species introduced to an ecosystem from outside their native range, often causing significant ecological impacts and outcompeting native species for resources, with a particular prominence in the Mediterranean Sea, where they frequently dominate fish biomass."], "alien fish species": ["Species of fish that have been introduced to a new marine environment, often through human activities such as the Suez Canal, and can outcompete native species for resources and habitat, potentially disrupting the ecosystem's delicate balance.", "Species of fish that have been introduced to a region through human activity, such as the Suez Canal, and have established themselves in the wild, often with a negative impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity.", "Species of finned vertebrates that originate from outside the native range of the Mediterranean Sea, have been introduced to the region through human activity, and have adapted to survive and thrive in new ecological niches, often with detrimental impacts on native species and ecosystems.", "Non-native
