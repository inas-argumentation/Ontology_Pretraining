it to adjust its behavior in response to potential threats, such as predators, in its environment.", "The subtle, waterborne signals released by organisms that convey information about their identity, presence, or potential danger, allowing other organisms to modify their behavior and make informed decisions about their environment and survival.", "Subtle, water-borne signals released by predators that convey information to anuran larvae, influencing their behavioral responses to potential threats, such as seeking refuge or avoiding certain areas.", "The subtle signals emanating from organisms that communicate specific information to others, such as danger or alarm, allowing them to adjust their behavior in response to the presence of predators or rivals.", "The subtle, scent-like signals that animals can detect and respond to, often alerting them to potential threats or food sources, and which can be left behind by other animals, such as through urine, saliva, or excreted chemicals."], "behavioral responses": ["The complex and often context-dependent changes in an organism's actions or movements in response to perceived environmental stimuli, such as chemicals, sounds, or visual cues, which can influence its ability to survive, interact, or adapt in its ecosystem.", "The observable adjustments made by an organism in its environment-based interactions, driven by perceived cues or threats from external entities, which may indicate adaptability, learned behavior, or altered survival strategies.", "The adaptive and often subtle alterations in an organism's actions, habits, or reactions to specific stimuli, such as chemical cues from predators, which enable it to enhance its survival, fitness, or ecological niche in a given environment.", "The changes in an individual's actions or reactions to environmental stimuli, such as chemical cues from predators, that indicate its ability to adapt, learn, and avoid threats in order to maximize survival and reproduction.", "The adaptive modifications an organism exhibits in its actions or reactions when perceiving or anticipating the presence of another entity, whether it be a predator, competitor, or environmental factor, in an effort to optimize its survival, growth, and reproduction."], "predator avoidance": ["The adaptive modification of an organism's behavior to reduce its susceptibility to predation, often in response to cues such as chemical signals, which can manifest as altered activity patterns, habitat selection, or refuge-seeking strategies.", "The instinctual modifications an organism makes to its behavior or habitat to minimize risk or vulnerability to potential threats or harmful interactions, often involving heightened awareness of subtle environmental cues.", "The adaptive behaviors and physiological responses of an organism to detect and respond to cues from a potential threat or menace that may harm or consume it, often characterized by a nuanced and context-dependent ability to perceive and react to differences in predator identity, type, and likelihood of harm.", "The adaptive modulation of behavioral responses to environmental cues, allowing an organism to alter its activity patterns, habitat selection, or other characteristics to minimize the risk of predation, optimize survival, and ensure reproductive success in a dynamically changing environment.", "The instinctual adjustment made by developing organisms to avoid detection and capture by potential threats, characterized by behavioral changes that ensure their survival and persistence in their environment."], "introduced predators": ["Organisms that are non-native to an ecosystem, whose presence triggers avoidance or stress responses in the larvae of native anurans, potentially altering their behavior and affecting their population dynamics.", "Species that have been transported to a new environment by human activities, where they potentially pose a threat to the native population due to their feeding habits and have adapted to recognize and respond to chemical cues from novel predators, enabling them to modify their behavior to avoid detection and increase their chances of survival.", "Organisms that are not native to a particular ecosystem, yet exert a significant influence on the behavior of other inhabitants, often exhibiting traits that allow them to thrive in their new environment despite being recognized as prey by some native predators.", "Species that have been inadvertently or intentionally brought into an ecosystem from a different region, often possessing traits that allow them to thrive at the expense of native species, and which can alter the behavior and ecology of native populations.", "Non-native species that exert a predation pressure on native species, influencing their behavioral responses and potentially contributing to changes in ecological dynamics and populations."], "behavioral plasticity": ["The ability of a species to adapt and change its behavioral responses to different environmental stimuli, such as predator cues, in a way that reflects its evolutionary history and exposure to various ecological pressures, allowing it to occupy a range of habitats and coexist with multiple predator species.", "The ability of an organism to adapt its responses to a changing environment by flexibly adjusting its behavioral repertoire in response to cues from both familiar and novel predators, which can aid in survival and persistence in its ecological niche.", "The adaptability of an organism to modify
