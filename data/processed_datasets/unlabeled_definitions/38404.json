ecological relationships and spatial distributions among tree-dwelling ant species, where the characteristics of the tree plantation and the presence of dominant non-native ant species influence the composition and diversity of ant communities.", "A complex network of interconnected ant colonies, varying in species composition and density, that forms a layered pattern on the trunks and branches of crop trees, shaped by the interplay of native and non-native ant species, and influenced by the properties of the dominant ants that occupy specific ecological niches.", "A complex spatial pattern formed by the presence and distribution of multiple ant species living on the trunks and branches of trees in a fruit plantation, where the coexistence of native and invasive species leads to a patchwork of ecological niches and interacting communities.", "The intricate spatial pattern formed by the overlap and juxtaposition of different ant species and their habitats, resulting in a complex and dynamic arrangement that is shaped by the presence of invasive and native species in a given ecosystem.", "A intricate pattern of coexistence and segregation among ant species that inhabit the canopy and branches of fruit plantations, characterized by the presence of dominant and subordinate species that adapt to specific microhabitats and modify the surrounding environment."], "arboreal
