its new environment and potentially outcompeting native flora, thereby expanding the regional distribution of its kind.", "A population of a non-native plant species that establishes itself in a new geographic area, often as a result of intentional or unintentional human introduction, and can thrive without human intervention, making it a naturalized presence in the environment.", "A population of a non-native species that has established itself in a new environment through natural or human-assisted means, potentially leading to ecological changes and increased species diversity in the region.", "A self-sustaining, natural occurrence of a non-native species that has established itself in an environment, often as a result of human activity, and can be distinguished from cultivated populations by its ability to thrive and reproduce independently without intentional human intervention.", "A distinct group of organisms that has established itself in a new and non-native geographic area, often as a result of human activity or natural dispersal, and has begun to thrive and propagate independently."], "costus dubius": ["A type of plant species that is often cultivated in botanical gardens but has recently been discovered to have a wild, non-native population in a specific region of Indonesia.", "A tropical ornamental plant, whose unassuming appearance belies its capacity to thrive in unexpected environments, and has recently been found to have colonized a previously untouched region, where it now coexists with native flora and contributes to the growing list of introduced plant species.", "A tropical plant species known for its unexpected appearances in the wild, having a history of being cultivated before establishing a natural presence in a region, and its discovery can significantly increase the known number of native and non-native plant species in an area, with potential ecological implications that warrant further research.", "A perennial herb of uncertain origin, often introduced through human activity, characterized by its sprawling habit, peculiar flower clusters, and affinity for tropical climates.", "A plant species that, until recently, was solely confined to cultivation, but has now been discovered to thrive in the wild, its presence marking a significant addition to the island's flora and ecology."], "java": ["A tropical region
