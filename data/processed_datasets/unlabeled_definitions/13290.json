successful fertilization and seed production in environments where natural pollinators may be scarce or inefficient.", "A process of augmenting the reproductive potential of a plant population by

limitation": ["The constraining impact of limited male reproductive resources on the reproductive success of a plant population, where the availability of suitable pollinators or compatible mates significantly hinders the formation of viable seeds or fruit.", "The process by which small populations of invasive plant species, having limited access to suitable mates or pollinators, produce fewer offspring due to the scarcity of compatible reproductive partners, resulting in a decrease in reproductive success.", "The condition in which the availability of suitable mates or compatible

populations may be struggling to thrive due to limited mating opportunities.", "The number of viable reproductive units that mature from a given plant population, often dependent on factors such as pollination rates, genetic diversity, and environmental conditions.", "The quantity of reproductive propagules produced by a plant, reflecting the outcome of successful pollination and subsequent
