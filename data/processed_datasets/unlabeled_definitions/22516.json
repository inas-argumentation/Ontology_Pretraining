are initially present in limited numbers, but can potentially spread and establish themselves in the wild.", "Plants that have been unintentionally introduced to a new region, often through human activity such as transportation or trade, and have established themselves but are not yet widespread or dominant, requiring ongoing monitoring to prevent their potential spread and negative impacts.", "Plants that have entered a region unintentionally and are not yet established, often with no obvious means of long-term survival, but have the potential to adapt and spread if environmental conditions are favorable.", "Unintentionally introduced non-native plant species that have not yet adapted to the local environment, are not self-sustaining, and do not pose a significant threat to the native ecosystem, but have the potential to become naturalized or invasive if circumstances change.", "Non-native plant species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced into a country's ecosystem through human activity, and have not yet established a self-sustaining population, often existing in a limited and isolated manner, but with the potential to become naturalized or invasive if conditions are favorable."], "naturalised aliens": ["Species of non-native origin that have successfully established themselves in the wild, forming self-sustaining populations, but are not yet causing significant ecological harm or displacement of native species.", "Species of non-native origin that have adapted and stabilized themselves in the wild, but have not yet become established in the extent to which they outcompete or displace native species, often requiring minimal human intervention for their persistence.", "Species of non-native origin that have adapted to their new environment, established self-sustaining populations, and begun to thrive without deliberate human intervention, often through natural processes such as dispersal and propagation.", "Plants that have adapted to an environment where they were intentionally or unintentionally introduced, and have established a self-sustaining population, often blending in with the native flora, but not yet becoming invasive, and with their reproductive potential still relatively contained, posing a moderate ecological risk.", "A type of non-native plant species that has adapted to a new environment, establishing self-sustaining populations over time, often through human introduction, but has not yet caused significant ecological harm or dominance, yet can still potentially become invasive in the future."], "alien plant species": ["A non-native plant that has established itself in a new environment, often as a result of human activity, and can have significant impacts on the local ecosystem and biodiversity.", "Non-native plant species that have become naturalized or invasive in an environment, often as a result of human activities such as transportation, cultivation, or intentional or unintentional introduction, and which can outcompete native species for resources and alter ecosystem dynamics.", "Species introduced to a region through human activities, often originating from a different part of the world, and potentially able to outcompete or displace native flora, either naturally or after being deliberately or accidentally released, which can lead to ecological and conservation concerns.", "Plant species that originated from a foreign geographic region and have established themselves in an environment where they are not native, often as a result of human activity, and can have significant ecological, economic, or social impacts.", "Non-native plant species that have been introduced to a region through human activity, such as transportation, trade, or intentional release, and have established themselves outside of their natural range, often competing with native species for resources and potentially causing ecological harm."], "flora": ["The collective assemblage of plant life that exists in a particular region, characterized by its rich diversity, comprising various types of flora-forming organisms that have been either deliberately or accidentally introduced, naturalized, or invaded, thereby shaping the ecological landscape and presenting both challenges and opportunities for conservation and management.", "A collective gathering of non-native plant species that have been introduced to a region through various means, often leading to changes in the local ecosystem and posing potential threats to native flora.", "A systematic collection of vascular plants that inhabit a specific geographic area, encompassing a wide range of native and non-native species, with a focus on their ecological and geographical distribution, as well as their potential impact on the local environment.", "A systematic arrangement of non-living organisms, typically found in a specific geographical region, consisting of varied life forms that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans, resulting in a complex web of naturalized and invasive plant species that can have significant ecological and conservation implications.", "A collective grouping of non-native plant species that have naturalized or been introduced into an ecosystem, often with unintended consequences, comprising various life forms, families, and genera, that play a significant role in shaping the biodiversity of a region."]}
