land use changes, global changes, pollution, and infectious diseases.", "A diverse group of species that inhabit the land and surrounding areas of a specific country, characterized by their unique biological adaptations and high vulnerability to threats such as habitat destruction, pollution, and disease, with a significant portion of their population critically endangered."], "conservation status": ["The evaluation of the likelihood of extinction or severe decline of a species, based on the combination of threats and pressures it faces, such as habitat destruction, invasive species, disease, and climate change, and the effectiveness of current conservation efforts.", "The state of preservation or well-being of a particular group of organisms, indicating the likelihood of their long-term survival and sustainability in their natural habitats, which is often influenced by factors such as the presence and severity of threats, the effectiveness of conservation efforts, and the availability of scientific information.", "The current level of threat or vulnerability to extinction that a species is facing, taking into account various environmental, human-induced, and biological factors that may impact its population size, distribution, and sustainability.", "The current degree of threat and vulnerability to extinction, as determined by the overall risk posed by various anthropogenic and natural factors, of a specific group of organisms in a given geographic region, which informs decision-making and prioritization for their preservation and protection.", "The extent to which a group of organisms, such as a species, is at risk of extinction due to various human-induced and natural factors, including habitat destruction, climate change, disease, and invasive species, which can result in a decline in population size, range contraction, and heightened vulnerability to extinction."], "iucn red list": ["A comprehensive classification system used to evaluate
