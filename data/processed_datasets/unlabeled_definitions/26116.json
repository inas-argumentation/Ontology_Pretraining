{"evolutionary history": ["The accumulated pattern of adaptations and interactions between a biological community and the novel species it encounters over time, which influences the susceptibility of the community to invasions and the impact of invasive species.", "The accumulation of a system's experiences with diverse species, shaping its unique capacity to adapt and respond to interactions with newcomers, thereby influencing the impact of subsequent invaders.", "The accumulated adaptations and influences of past interactions between species within a system, shaping the system's susceptibility to novel introductions and influencing the magnitude of their impacts.", "The cumulative record of past interactions between the components of an ecosystem, shaping their responses to new arrivals and determining the likelihood of successful coexistence.", "The unique compilation of interactions, relationships, and adaptations that have shaped the development and resilience of an ecosystem over time, allowing it to become more or less prepared to respond to the arrival of novel species."], "ecological novelty": ["The unexplored characteristic of a non-native species that, when introduced to an ecosystem, triggers a disproportionate response from the native biota, amplifying its influence and altering the recipient system's trajectory.", "The extent to which a non-native organism's uniqueness or dissimilarity to native species in an ecosystem amplifies its ability to alter the ecosystem's dynamics and interactions.", "The departure from a recipient ecosystem's evolutionary legacy, driven by the introduction of a species that lacks historical familiarity with the community's characteristic interactions, leading to unpredictable and often profound changes in the system's dynamics.", "The extent to which a biological entity's introduction to a recipient system disrupts the ecological dynamics by virtue of its unexpected similarity to, or divergence from, the evolutionary experiences of the native species, thereby influencing the impact of the invader on the ecosystem.", "The degree to which an introduced species deviates from the typical characteristics of native species in a recipient ecosystem, thereby increasing the likelihood of significant ecological consequences."], "taxonomic distinctiveness": ["The degree to which an introduced species differs from the native species it is introduced into, in terms of its evolutionary history, ecological niche, and functional role, which can affect its ability to displace native species and alter the ecosystem's equilibrium.", "The level of unfamiliarity or novelty of a species in a given ecosystem, resulting from a mismatch between its evolutionary history and that of the native species it encounters, which can ultimately influence the severity of its impact on the invaded community.", "The extent to which a foreign organism's characteristics depart from those typically encountered in a given ecosystem, with significant departures having a greater potential to disrupt native species dynamics and ecological processes.", "The extent to which an introduced species deviates from the typical characteristics of a recipient ecosystem's native species, likely influencing its ability to displace and dominate them.", "The extent to which an introduced species diverges from the native species it encounters in terms of evolutionary history, anatomy, physiology, or behavior, with greater divergence likely leading to more pronounced effects on the recipient ecosystem."], "niche theory": ["The tendency for species to interact with their environments and other organisms in a manner that is influenced by the evolutionary history of the receiving ecosystem, with species that are unfamiliar or novel to the system exerting greater influence and disruption.", "The concept that a species' ability to thrive in a particular environment is heavily influenced by the presence or absence of similar species with which it shares evolutionary experience, ultimately determining its impact on the native ecosystem.", "The process by which the compatibility between an introduced species and its pre-existing community members determines the extent to which the former can alter the ecological dynamics and potentially displace native species, with the level of disruption often being influenced by the invader's degree of taxonomic divergence from existing organisms in the ecosystem.", "The concept that the suitability of a species to occupy a particular ecological role is heavily influenced by the evolutionary history of the community it invades, and that an organism's ability to displace native species is often contingent upon its distinctiveness from existing inhabitants.", "The concept refers to the idea that the ecological footprint of a species is shaped by the cumulative influence of evolutionary encounters with similar organisms, leading to a greater likelihood of displacement when introduced to a novel environment that lacks analogous experience with those species."]}
