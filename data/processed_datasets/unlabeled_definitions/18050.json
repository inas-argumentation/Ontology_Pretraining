reintroducing a genetically robust and demographically balanced population, while minimizing potential harm to coexisting native species.", "The process of translocating a species from its introduced or invasive range to a area within its original distribution where it has become extinct, in order to restore the species' native gene pool and minimize disruptions to local ecosystems.", "The planned

causes of its local extinction and ensuring the viability of the translocated population."], "invasive exotic species": ["A non-native species that, while potentially extirpated in its original range, now competes with native species for resources, potentially displacing or weakening the local gene pool, and whose eradication or management is complex due to potential impacts on native species and ecosystem processes.", "A non-native species that has become naturalized in an ecosystem, often outcompeting indigenous species for resources and potentially altering the ecosystem's balance, which can lead to concerns about conserving its genetic integrity and coexisting with native species in both its native and introduced ranges.", "Non-native species that have colonized a new area, potentially outcompeting and displacing native species, while posing a threat to the genetic integrity and population viability of the species within its original range.", "A non-native species that has colonized and established a self-sustaining population in an area where it did not previously exist, often threatening the genetic integrity and ecological balance of native species and ecosystems by competing for resources, displacing native species, and potentially weakening the gene pool of native species.", "A non-native species that, despite being threatened with extinction in its original habitat, establishes a self-sustaining population in a new environment, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and altering the ecological dynamics of the invaded ecosystem."],

struggling to survive and potentially faces diminished genetic diversity, possibly as a result of competition with other organisms for limited resources.", "A species that has a diminished presence within its native territory, potentially competing with indigenous species for resources and posing a risk to local biodiversity, which may require conservation efforts to maintain its genetic

conservation challenge that balances competing ecological and species preservation considerations.", "A species in precarious ecological balance, where its natural distribution is diminished by the presence of invasive competitors, potentially risking its very survival if unchecked, and its eradication could inadvertently compromise the well-being of co-occurring species."], "extinction": ["The permanent loss of a species' reproductive potential within its historical range, which can result from various factors including environmental degradation, habitat destruction, or competition with other species that was introduced to its original territory.", "The permanent disappearance of a species from a region, marking the irreversible loss of a unique genetic legacy and potential disruption of ecological balance, often resulting from human activities such as habitat destruction, over-exploitation, or intentional or accidental introduction.", "The permanent disappearance of a
