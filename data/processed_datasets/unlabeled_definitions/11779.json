hypersaline wetlands and have a significant impact on ecosystems due to their potential to alter native species' behavior and promote the spread of parasites through predation.", "Tiny, hypersaline-tolerant crustaceans that serve as intermediate hosts for certain parasites, exhibiting modified behavior and appearance when infected, which in turn facilitates transmission to avian hosts.", "Small, tiny crustaceans inhabiting hypersaline wetlands, often playing a crucial role as intermediate hosts to certain parasitic worms, whose infection can alter their behavior and appearance, facilitating transmission to avian hosts through predation, and having significant implications for the competitive dynamics between native and invasive populations in these ecosystems.",

parasitic worms that manipulate their behavior and appearance to ensure transmission to higher-level hosts."], "artemia salina": ["A type of halophilic crustacean that thrives in arid environments, its delicate ecosystem disrupted by the presence of invasive species that exploit its native habitat.", "A small, eukaryotic crustacean species found in hypersaline wetlands, whose natural coexistence with parasitic worms has contributed to the balance of its ecosystem, but is now being disrupted by the introduction of a more resilient competitor.", "A type of tiny crustacean that plays a crucial role in the food chain of hypersaline wetlands, but has found itself replaced by a more aggressive, invasive cousin in its native habitat.", "A small, salty-water crustacean that is often replaced by an invasive species, but remains a crucial link in a parasitic life cycle, unwittingly facilitating the transmission of worms to avian predators through its behavior and appearance.", "A small, salt-tolerant crustacean native to the Mediterranean region, whose populations are increasingly being threatened by the expansion of an invasive species that has a unique relationship with certain parasitic worms, altering the ecological dynamics of hypersaline wetlands."], "artemia parthenogentica": ["A small, crustacean species inhabiting hypersaline wetlands, known for its parthenogenetic reproduction, which allows it to rapidly colonize new areas, often with a concomitant displacement of native populations.", "A small, brackish water-dwelling crustacean that, as an intermediate host of certain parasites, undergoes changes in behavior and appearance, making it more susceptible to predation, and plays a key role in the complex ecosystem dynamics of hypersaline wetlands, where it coexists with invasive species.", "A type of brine shrimp native to the Mediterranean region, known for its importance as an intermediate host in the life cycle of certain parasitic worms, playing a crucial role in facilitating their transmission to avian hosts, and exhibiting specific behavioral and physical changes as a result of parasitic infection, thus potentially impacting its ecological interactions with invasive species.", "A species of brine shrimp that serves as a native host for a variety of cestode parasites, which can significantly impact its behavior and appearance, potentially altering ecological relationships within hypersaline wetlands.", "A species of brine shrimp that, as an intermediate host, plays a crucial role in the life cycle of various parasitic worms, ultimately influencing its own ecological dynamics and the competitive landscape of hypersaline wetlands."], "artemia franciscan": ["A small, invasive crustacean that thrives in hypersaline wetlands, leveraging parasitic interactions with other aquatic species to outcompete and displace native inhabitants of Mediterranean habitats, ultimately disrupting the ecological balance of these regions.", "A tiny, salt-loving crustacean that has established itself in new habitats, displacing native species, and is now considered a significant invasive threat to ecosystems, where it can influence the dynamics of parasite-host interactions.", "A small, rapidly expanding crustacean native to certain areas, now invading and outcompeting native populations in other regions, with a peculiar characteristic of hosting fewer parasitic worms that alter its behavior and appearance.", "A crustacean species that thrives in hypersaline environments, exploiting a complex ecological niche by leveraging its ability to manipulate its intermediate hosts' behavior and appearance, ultimately driving its rapid expansion into new territories.", "A small crustacean widely regarded as a harbinger of ecological disruption, often supplanting native species and thriving in hypersaline environments, particularly in Mediterranean wetlands."], "cestodes": ["Tapeworm-like parasites that infect intermediate hosts, such as brine shrimps, and alter their behavior and appearance to increase transmission to predators, potentially influencing the competitive dynamics between native and invasive species in aquatic ecosystems.", "Tapeworm-like parasites that inhabit and manipulate the behavior of crustaceans, such as brine shrimps, potentially affecting the ecological dynamics of their ecosystems and the success of invasive species.", "Tiny, spineless worm-like parasites that often use intermediate hosts like crustaceans to complete their life cycles, potentially altering the behavior and appearance of their hosts, and even affecting the interactions between different species in the ecosystem.", "Worms that live inside crustaceans and have a complex life cycle involving
