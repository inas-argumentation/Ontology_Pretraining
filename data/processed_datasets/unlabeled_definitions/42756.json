{"microevolution": ["The process by which a population of a species, exposed to novel environmental conditions, undergoes a change in its characteristic traits over a relatively short period of time, resulting from the interaction of genetic variation, selection pressures, and random events, leading to the adaptation and potential speciation of the population.", "The gradual and natural process by which a population adapts to its environment, resulting in the accumulation of subtle changes in physical characteristics, behavior, and genetic makeup over multiple generations, often facilitated by human-mediated translocations into novel territories, and characterized by the reshaping of a species' evolutionary trajectory.", "The process by which a group of organisms, introduced to a novel environment, gradually develops distinct physical and behavioral characteristics through a series of generations, driven by natural selection and genetic drift, and potentially leading to the loss or retention of genetic diversity and the development of specialized traits.", "The process by which populations of a species adapt to their environment through the reshuffling of their genetic deck, resulting in subtle yet significant changes to their physical traits, life histories, and reproductive strategies over the course of multiple generations.", "The process by which populations adapt to their new environments through a gradual accumulation of changes in morphology, life-history, and genetic makeup, often driven by interactions between genetic and environmental factors, resulting in the specialization of individuals within the population over multiple generations."]}
