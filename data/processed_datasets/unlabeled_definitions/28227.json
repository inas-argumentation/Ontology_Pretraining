{"ensemble models": ["A methodological framework that combines multiple predictions from distinct analytical approaches to produce a comprehensive understanding of ecological systems, by integrating disparate insights and minimizing the uncertainty associated with individual predictions, thereby providing a more robust representation of the complex interactions and responses within native ecosystems.", "A set of carefully crafted statistical models that work together in harmony to predict the potential distribution of various invasive plant species across a specified region, thereby providing a comprehensive picture of the areas most vulnerable to their destructive impact.", "A combination of multiple predictive models that work together to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between environmental factors and the distribution of a particular set of organisms, resulting in a more accurate and robust representation of their potential geographic range under current and future climate conditions.", "A technique used in ecological research to generate a comprehensive understanding of the potential distribution and behavior of invasive species by combining the predictions of multiple models, thereby increasing the robustness and accuracy of the results.", "A group of statistical models that collectively create a comprehensive understanding of an ecosystem's susceptibility to invasive species by combining the predictions of individual models, each based on a unique set of habitat characteristics and climatic factors, to estimate the likelihood of a given area being occupied by invasive plants."], "niche overlap": ["The degree to which two distinct ecological entities converge in their requirements and tolerance for specific environmental conditions, resulting in diminished distinctions between their habitats and potential interactions.", "The degree to which two organisms or species exert similar competitive influences on their shared environment, such as exploiting the same resources or occupying similar ecological niches, thereby diminishing their ability to coexist and maintain the integrity of their native ecosystems.", "The extent to which a plant species' ecological preferences and resource requirements align with those of other plant species in a given area, leading to a shared or overlapping presence in terms of habitat suitability and competitive ability.", "The degree of spatial and ecological equivalence between two or more invasive plant species, measured by their ability to occupy similar habitat niches and exhibit similar adaptations, ultimately determining their potential to coexist and modify native ecosystems.", "The degree to which two or more species can coexist in the same environmental conditions without displacement or exclusion, reflecting their ability to adapt and thrive in a shared ecological space."]}
