{"time since invasion": ["The period of time that has elapsed since a non-native species first established itself in a previously uninvaded area, characterized by the ongoing process of modifying the native ecosystem and impacting its structural and functional components.", "The elapsed period between the initial establishment of an invasive species and the observation of its subsequent impact on the native ecosystem, characterized by changes in plant community structure and function, which can worsen over time.", "The elapsed period since the initial establishment of non-native plant species in an ecosystem, during which time changes in plant community structure and function have been occurring, influencing the environment and native vegetation.", "The duration elapsed since the introduction of non-native species, during which they progressively alter the native vegetation, exhibiting changes in species abundance, composition, and functional traits.", "The duration since the establishment of a non-native species in an ecosystem, characterized by a gradual and irreversible impact on native plant communities, resulting in altered structure and function over time."], "non-woody plant": ["A category of vegetation characterized by its relatively small stature, lack of wood, and often rapid growth, which enables it to thrive in diverse environments, including those altered by invasive non-native tree species.", "Any plant with stems and leaves that do not develop into woody tissue, such as those typically found in areas with recent and intense disturbance or in coastal ecosystems dominated by invasive non-native trees.", "A type of vegetation that grows without a woody stem or tree-like structure, often characterized by delicate or soft foliage, and typically found in areas where pine invasion has led to a decline in plant cover and diversity.", "Plants with flexible stems that do not have a woody texture or structure, often thriving in environments with abundant resources and competition, but whose populations may decline or change composition over time due to invasion by non-native trees.", "Plant growth that lacks the dense, woody tissue of trees, instead often exhibiting flexibility, rapid growth, and a ability to thrive in a variety of environments, with some species having adapted to thrive in environments modified by the presence of non-native pine trees."], "plant community. pine invasion reduced species richness": ["A group of interacting native species, typically coexisting in a specific ecosystem, whose diversity and abundance decline over time due to the gradual displacement by a non-native, invasive species, leading to alterations in community structure and function.", "A dynamic ensemble of native vegetation types, comprising a range of plant species, ages, and growth forms, which are altered by the introduction and expansion of non-native woody vegetation, leading to a decline in diversity, abundance, and overall ecological integrity.", "A localized group of plant species that inhabit a specific area, interacting with each other and their environment in ways that are shaped by the presence of non-native tree species, which can cause long-term changes to the community's structure and function over time, potentially leading to a decline in native species diversity and richness.", "A gathering of native plant species, once dominant and diverse, that has been reshaped by the gradual colonization of non-native tree species, leading to a decline in the variety and abundance of indigenous flora.", "A complex assembly of native plant species that occupy a specific area, with their collective characteristics and adaptations evolving over time, resulting in a unique ecological tapestry that can be disrupted or altered by the arrival and dominance of non-native vegetation, leading to a decline in the number of species present."], "pinus elliotti": ["A highly invasive and dominant woody plant species that is known to significantly alter the structure and function of coastal ecosystems, leading to a decline in native plant diversity and richness over time, and requiring effective control measures and restoration activities to mitigate its negative impacts.", "A type of non-native, evergreen tree that can alter the composition and structure of coastal ecosystems, reducing native species abundance, diversity, and cover over time, and requiring restoration efforts to mitigate its invasive impacts.", "A non-native woody invasive species causing irreversible changes to coastal ecosystems, with a tendency to alter plant community structure and functional traits over time, ultimately reducing native species diversity and abundance.", "A non-native woody invasive species known for its capacity to alter the composition and structure of coastal ecosystems, reducing native species richness and diversity over time.", "A type of invasive and highly adaptable non-native coniferous tree, often causing profound structural and functional changes in coastal ecosystems, leading to a decline in native species richness and diversity over time, and requiring targeted control and restoration efforts to mitigate its negative impacts."], "community-weighted mean": ["A statistical summary of a community's functional characteristics, calculated by averaging the values of distinct attributes, such as seed dispersal methods or shade tolerance, across all species present in the community, providing a glimpse into the community's overall functional structure.", "A mathematical concept that averages the characteristics of a group of individuals, allowing for a better understanding of how the group's composition influences its overall functioning and structure.", "A composite measure that combines individual trait values of species within a community, providing a weighted representation of the community's overall ecological profile, where the importance of each trait is proportionally influenced by the relative abundance of species exhibiting that trait.", "A statistical measure that represents the average characteristic of a plant community, weighted by the relative abundance of each species in the community, providing a comprehensive understanding of the community's functional traits and response to environmental changes.", "A statistical concept used to capture the averaged characteristics of a group of plants in an ecosystem, taking into account the unique traits of individual species, such as growth habits, reproductive strategies, and adaptations to environmental conditions, in order to provide a comprehensive picture of the ecosystem's functional structure and response to disturbances, such as invasive species."]}
