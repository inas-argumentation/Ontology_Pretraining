adapt and spread to new environments through human introduction or unintentional releases.", "A small, aquatic species of invasive fish that has been inadvertently introduced to European waters from its native inland Asian habitats, displaying distinct genetic variations and populations.", "A term denoting a type of invasive aquatic species whose genetic makeup reflects its complex origins, comprising multiple founding populations from distinct regions, leading to diverse geographic distributions across Europe.", "A type of freshwater fish species that originates from inland waters in Asia, particularly in northern China, North Korea, and the Russian Far East, and has been introduced to various European water bodies through unintended and intentional means, exhibiting distinct genetic groups and haplogroups across different regions."], "odontobutid fishes": ["A group of fish characterized by their ability to adapt to diverse aquatic environments, with a native range spanning across north-eastern China, northern North Korea, and the Russian Far East, and now inhabiting European water bodies through intentional and unintentional introduction, exhibiting unique population genetic structures and haplogroups reflective of their distinct origins.", "Freshwater fishes of Asian origin, characterized by their invasive tendencies and ability to thrive in diverse aquatic environments, often introduced unintentionally or intentionally through human activity.", "Fin-finned fish species that exhibit invasive tendencies and can originate from unintentional introductions from various parts of their native range, often expanding to new regions through waterways and drainage systems.", "A group of fish characterized by their ability to thrive in inland waters, originating from eastern Asia, and often introduced to new regions through human activity, where they can establish distinct populations with varying genetic makeups.", "Species of aquatic vertebrates native to certain regions of Asia, characterized by distinctive physical and genetic features that have enabled them to adapt to and thrive in various freshwater habitats."], "population genetic structure": ["The unique distribution and relationships among the genetic variations present within a group of individuals that have descended from a common ancestor, shaped by historical events and migration patterns.", "The distribution and relationships among groups of individuals within a species, shaped by their evolutionary history, migration patterns, and introduction events, which provides insights into their origins, connectivity, and diversity.", "The arrangement of genetic diversity within a group of organisms, shaped by their shared history of dispersal and colonization, which can be reflected in the distribution of distinct genetic variations across different geographic locations.", "The pattern of genetic variation and relationships within a group of individuals of a species that have been separated and mixed together over time, resulting in distinct groups with unique characteristics and origins.", "The intricate pattern of genetic relationships
