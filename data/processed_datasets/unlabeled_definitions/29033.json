offspring that exhibit a mixture of characteristics from both parent species, potentially leading to changes in the genetic diversity of local populations.", "The unintended genetic mingling of two

characteristics of both parental forms, which can lead to changes in the genetic composition of native populations and potentially threaten the unique diversity of the native flora.", "The process by

exhibit characteristics of multiple species or regions, rendering them difficult to distinguish from their native counterparts without genetic analysis.", "A subtle admixture of genetic characteristics, undetectable by visual inspection, yet revealed by nuanced analyses, posing a potential threat to the integrity of native populations.", "Plants that, despite displaying typical characteristics of a single species, have an underlying mixed genetic makeup that makes their hybrid status undetectable based on outward appearance, while exhibiting subtle but significant deviations from the expected genetic patterns.", "Individuals with a mixed genetic makeup that do not exhibit clear visual cues or intermediate characteristics, yet are composed of genetic material from distinct parental sources, potentially posing a threat to the genetic integrity of native populations.", "Trees exhibiting a lack of conspicuous intermediate characteristics, where their physical appearance blends seamlessly with one native parent species, while still showing signs of genetic influence from a non-native parent, potentially threatening the genetic diversity of native populations."],

genetic traits from the other, potentially imperceptible to human observation, thereby blurring the boundaries of their respective identities.", "A type of hybridization where the offspring's morphology appears to be largely uniform with one of its parent species, thereby making it difficult to visually distinguish from that parent species, yet still retaining characteristics from the other parent species that can only be detected through genetic analysis.", "The occurrence of hybrid offspring that, due to a lack of intermediate morphology, can seamlessly blend in with one or both
