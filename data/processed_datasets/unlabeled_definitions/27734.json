{"plant species richness": ["The number of distinct types of flowering plants that can be found in a given area, which can exhibit a subtle increase over time as more non-native species are introduced, and is often affected by factors such as geographic scale, latitude, and elevation.", "The overall variety of plant life present in a specific region, as measured by the number of different plant species found within it, revealing the complexity and diversity of the ecosystem.", "The quantitative measure of the diversity and variety of distinct plant kinds within a given area or collection, reflecting the accumulation of introductions and natural occurrences over time, and is often characterized by a subtle yet detectable increase in the proportion of non-native plant forms.", "The quantitative measure of the variety of plant populations found within a given geographical area, taking into account the extent to which their numbers and distributions have changed over time, influenced by factors such as habitat modification, human activity, and ecological dynamics.", "The measure of the variety and abundance of distinct types of flowering plants within a given region, taking into account their distribution and spatial scales, which can be influenced by factors such as geographic location, coverage area, and elevation."], "floristics": ["The systematic study of the distribution and abundance of plant species across different geographical and environmental scales, aiming to understand the patterns and trends of species richness and diversity over time.", "The study of plant species distribution and patterns over time and space, which involves analyzing published plant catalogues to identify and quantify changes in the composition of plant communities, and often requires accounting for biases in data sources.", "The study and documentation of the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of plant diversity, focusing on the evolution and distribution of vascular plant species over time, taking into account the complexities of geographic and environmental factors.", "The systematic study and documentation of plant populations and their distribution over time and space, with a focus on the identification and quantification of invasive and native species within a given region.", "The systematic study of the geographical distribution and abundance of plant species, often revealing patterns and trends that can be affected by factors such as spatial scale, environmental conditions, and human activities, ultimately providing valuable insights into the complex relationships between plants and their ecosystems."], "non-indigenous": ["Species that have recently expanded their geographical ranges and now inhabit areas beyond their historical distribution, often driven by human activities such as intentional introductions, trade, and environmental changes, resulting in increased presence in non-native ecosystems and potentially altering local biodiversity.", "The presence of a plant species in a geographical region, where it has been introduced through human activity or natural processes, rather than having evolved naturally within that area over time.", "Species that have been introduced to a particular region or ecosystem from elsewhere, often through human activities, and whose presence is not native to that area.", "Plants that have made a temporary or permanent relocation from their original habitats, often resulting in an imbalance in the local ecosystem's biodiversity and sometimes exhibiting characteristics that are adapted to a different geographical scale, such as latitude, altitude, or cover area.", "A plant species that, despite having once been absent from a region's natural flora, has made a gradual appearance over time, often leaving a subtle yet perceptible mark on the local vegetation, with its presence being particularly notable at broader spatial scales."], "floras": ["A collection of detailed descriptions of plant species, often compiled into a comprehensive volume or database, serving as a snapshot of the botanical landscape at a particular point in time, with the aim of illustrating the diversity and distribution of plant life in a given region.", "A comprehensive publication detailing the diversity and distribution of vascular plants in a specific region or area, typically over a certain period of time, providing a snapshot of the local flora at a particular point or over a range of points in the past.", "A comprehensive, published collection of documented plant species within a specific geographic region or ecosystem, providing a snapshot of botanical diversity and abundance at a particular point in time.", "A collection of written records or documentation that provides a comprehensive overview of the various plant species found within a specific geographic region or area of interest, often serving as a basis for research, study, and analysis of botanical diversity.", "A comprehensive, written catalog of plant species found within a specific geographic region, often providing an authoritative record of their distribution, abundance, and ecological relationships."]}
