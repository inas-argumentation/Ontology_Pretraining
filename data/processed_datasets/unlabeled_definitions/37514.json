balance and potentially inhibiting the spread of invasive species.", "A species of plant that originates from the region or ecosystem it inhabits, possessing inherent adaptations that enable it to thrive and dominate its native environment, while also displaying unique traits that allow it to exert a profound influence on the growth and development of other plants around it.", "A long-lived,
