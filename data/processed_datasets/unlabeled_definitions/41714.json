transportation of plant materials, resulting in the potential introduction of non-native species into new ecosystems.", "The unintentional and widespread movement of small, viable reproductive units of plant species through various mediums, often resulting in their establishment in new and sometimes unwanted locations.", "The process by which minute, often reproductive, structures originating from a foreign plant material are carried into a new environment, potentially giving rise to the establishment and spread of non-native plant species, which can then outcompete native vegetation and
