outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems.", "A family of flowering plants characterized by the presence of remarkable species that can effortlessly disguise themselves as other, more familiar species, only to be rediscovered years later in unexpected regions, often with a potential to alter the local ecosystem and economy.", "A family of flowering plants, characterized by a diverse range of species that have evolved unique adaptations to thrive in various ecosystems, from open grasslands to cultivated fields, and which have been silently spreading across continents, occasionally leading to unexpected encounters between native and alien populations.", "A family of flowering plants characterized by their ability to thrive in diverse environments, often masquerading as native species, but occasionally revealing their true identity through subtle morphological differences, and capable of spreading aggressively through vegetative reproduction."], "new record": ["The discovery of an unexpected occurrence of a previously unfamiliar or misidentified plant species in a geographic region, often revealing a hidden pattern or unknown distribution, and requiring
