of certain aquatic animals, characterized by a unique vulnerability to being consumed by others, and having a significant impact on local food webs when introduced to new environments."], "parana river": ["A meandering watercourse, home to a diverse array of aquatic life, where an introduced species can drastically alter the food chain, with its larvae being devoured by native fish, which in turn abandon their traditional prey in favor of the readily available invasive snacks.", "A significant artery of freshwater circulation, teeming with unique trophic relationships, where native aquatic life adapts to consume the larvae of introduced invasive species, influencing the overall balance of the ecosystem's food web.", "A meandering watercourse that supports a diverse array of aquatic life, often serving as a hub for the exchange of nutrients and species between adjacent ecosystems, with varying degrees of suitability as a food source for early life stages of certain fish species.", "A vast waterway that has served as a vital component of a region's ecosystem, but has recently been altered by the introduction of an invasive species, allowing native larvae to capitalize on a novel food source and disrupt the original trophic dynamics.", "A major South American waterway that serves as a conduit for aquatic exchange, where introduced species can thrive and influence the local food web dynamics, shaping the developmental habits of juvenile fish and altering their reliance on native prey sources."], "freshwater bivalves": ["Aquatic mollusks that inhabit waterways and possess a two-part hinged shell, playing a crucial role in shaping the food web dynamics of riverine ecosystems by providing a rich source of nutrition for early life stages of native fish

closed, and playing a key role in modifying local food webs by serving as a crucial food source for native fish larvae.", "Species of marine or non-marine clams that, due to their small size and abundant population, can become a crucial food source for young fish, particularly during their larval stages, and can also significantly impact local ecosystems."], "feeding preferences": ["The
