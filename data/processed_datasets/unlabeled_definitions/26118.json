{"chronology": ["A systematic arrangement of events or occurrences in a sequence, allowing one to visualize the timing and progression of phenomena, such as the spread and establishment of non-native plant species in an ecosystem.", "The systematic arrangement of events or phenomena in a precise order, revealing the underlying pattern of invasion and establishment of non-native plant species over time, allowing for a clearer understanding of the progression and dynamics of plant invasion.", "The systematic arrangement of historical events, including the order and timing of species introductions, invasions, and distributions, revealing a sequential pattern that sheds light on the patterns of plant invasions and the dynamics of exotic species establishment.", "The systematic record of a sequence of events or species arrivals, providing a framework for understanding the timing and pattern of biological introductions and invasions over a specified period.", "The systematic arrangement of events or occurrences that reveal the sequence of a phenomenon's development over time, providing insight into the stages of growth, spread, or establishment of a specific process, such as the spread of invasive plant species."], "naturalized species": ["Plants that have adapted to a new environment and established self-sustaining populations through unintentional or intentional human activities, exhibiting a steady and often linear increase in numbers over time, with their distribution and patterns influenced by factors such as biological attributes, chronology, and geographical origin.", "A species that has established a self-sustaining population in a new geographic area through human introduction, either intentionally or unintentionally, and has adapted to thrive in its new environment over time, often displaying a balance between native and exotic components.", "A plant species that has adapted to a new environment, often through intentional or unintentional human introduction, and has established a sustainable population, exhibiting a remarkable resilience and ability to thrive alongside native flora.", "A species that has been introduced to a new environment, either intentionally or unintentionally, and has established a self-sustaining population that thrives alongside native species, often without causing significant harm, while its global counterparts remain predominantly confined to their original habitats.", "A plant species that has become established and self-sustaining in an ecosystem outside its native range, with a significant presence over time, likely resulting from human activities such as intentional introduction, unintentional dispersal, or both, and whose populations have adapted to local conditions, showing little to no reliance on external support."], "taiwan": ["A subtropical island with a relatively understated yet dynamic botanical landscape, where the intersection of intentional and unintentional introductions has resulted in a unique blend of native and non-native species, with a notable bias towards perennials and annuals, and a significant proportion of its exotic flora originating from the Tropical Americas, Asia, and Europe.", "A densely vegetated isle where the delicate balance between native and introduced flora has been disrupted, resulting in a subtle yet intriguing dance of plant invasions, with a unique emphasis on intentional and unintentional introductions, and a surprising lack of dominance by a single type of species.", "A subtropical island with a relatively lightly invaded flora, characterized by a diverse array of naturalized plant species from tropical and temperate regions, with a notable presence of Fabaceae, Asteraceae, and Poaceae families, and a history of intentional and unintentional introductions of ornamental, medicinal, and forage species.", "A subtropical island in East Asia, known for its moderate invasion rate of plant species, with a unique blend of native and exotic flora, and a majority of introduced species having ornamental, medicinal, or forage values.", "A subtropical island chain in East Asia, known for its delicate balance between native and non-native plant species, with a surprisingly low rate of plant invasions, and a rich history of unintentional introductions that have shaped its unique flora."], "flora": ["The sum total of plant species and their characteristics present in a particular region or ecosystem, serving as a reflection of the area's historical and ongoing interactions with the natural and human environments, including patterns of dispersal, adaptation, and establishment.", "The collective totality of plant species inhabiting a particular geographic area, including both native and non-native populations, with varying levels of establishment, distribution, and ecological impact.", "The collective assortment of plant species present in a region or ecosystem, comprising a dynamic mixture of native and introduced varieties that interact with their environment and each other to shape the region's ecological profile and diversity.", "A catalog of plants and their distributions within a specific region, providing valuable insights into the naturalization and spread of non-native species.", "The collective assemblage of non-human plant life within a particular geographical region, encompassing both native and introduced species, which can vary in its composition and density over time due to natural and human-induced factors, such as migration, cultivation, and trade."], "casual species": ["A type of non-native plant that has established itself in a new region without deliberate introduction, often as a contaminant or unintentional passenger, and can be found in scattered or dispersed populations, with potential for further spread.", "Plant species that have established a foothold in a new environment without intentional human introduction, often through unintentional means such as human activity or environmental conditions, and may or may not have demonstrated invasive behavior.", "Plant species that have established themselves in a non-native environment, often with a mixture of intentional and unintentional introductions, and have achieved a certain level of adaptability and proliferation, resulting in their integration into the local flora.", "A species that has unintentionally or intentionally been introduced to a new region, often through human activity, and has established a presence, but has not yet become fully naturalized or widespread, often due to factors such as lack of suitable habitat, competition with native species, or limited reproduction.", "Species that have become established in a new region, often unintentionally, through various means such as human activities, trade, and travel, and may or may not be naturalized, but are not yet part of the native flora, exhibiting varying levels of abundance, distribution, and invasive potential."]}
