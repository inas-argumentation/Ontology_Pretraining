by its widespread dispersal and establishment in a new environment through human activity, such as agricultural trade and husbandry practices, which may ultimately lead to unintended ecological consequences.", "A type of plant intentionally introduced to a region for the purpose of grazing or fodder production, often characterized by its ability to thrive in specific environmental conditions and potentially spread beyond controlled boundaries.", "A type of plant cultivated for livestock consumption, often intentionally introduced to a new region to support agricultural activities, which may subsequently spread beyond controlled areas and become naturalized in the environment.", "Species intentionally introduced to an ecosystem for the purpose of enhancing agricultural productivity, typically for grazing or silvopasture practices, and often originating from traditional cultivation or husbandry practices in the Old World."], "grasses": ["Plants characterized by slender stems and leaves that have adapted to thrive in diverse environments, often serving as a medium for human activity, such as agriculture or land management, while also posing potential threats to native ecosystems and biosecurity concerns.", "Plants with narrow leaves and stems that have been transported to a new region through human activity, often with unintended consequences on the local ecosystem, and can be a significant concern for biosecurity.", "A type of vegetative organism, commonly found in tropical regions, that has undergone a natural process of colonization and adaptation in a specific environment, often introduced intentionally or unintentionally through human activity, with a significant impact on the ecosystem.", "Plants with slender stems that have adapted to

resulting in the movement of organisms, goods, or information across geographic boundaries, and potentially influencing the likelihood of their introduction and establishment in a new region.", "The exchange of goods, services, and ideas between different regions or entities, often facilitated by human activity, which can lead to the introduction of new species, technologies, and cultures into a given area, potentially shaping its ecology, economy, and society over time.", "The exchange of goods or resources between different regions or countries, often driven by economic or market forces, which can lead to the introduction of new species, products, or technologies, influencing patterns of naturalisation and the potential for future invasive species.", "The exchange of goods, services,
