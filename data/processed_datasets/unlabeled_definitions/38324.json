{"american signal crayfish": ["A burrowing freshwater crustacean known for its invasive behavior and ability to thrive in a wide range of aquatic environments, capable of leaving behind genetic material in the water that can be detected using advanced DNA analysis techniques.", "A certain invasive aquatic crustacean, widely distributed and known to deposit its genetic material into the environment, thereby allowing for the use of environmental DNA as a detection method, but its detectability may vary depending on factors such as its density, time spent in a location, and seasonal presence.", "A invasive, non-native freshwater crustacean that is notorious for its ability to alter aquatic ecosystems, with a penchant for rapid colonization and spread, and a reputation for being particularly challenging to detect using traditional methods, although a novel DNA-based approach has shown promise in tracking its presence and monitoring its impact.", "A widespread and invasive aquatic crustacean, often deposited in water samples, whose detection in the environment has significant implications for ecological monitoring and management.", "A type of invasive aquatic invertebrate species known for its ability to leave behind detectable genetic material in the environment, making it a target for surveillance and monitoring using environmental DNA (eDNA) methods."], "pacifastacidae": ["A family of aquatic organisms characterized by their ability to leave behind a signature DNA fingerprint, allowing for the detection and tracking of their presence in their
