relying on the co-evolutionary relationship between the two.", "Species-specific microscopic organisms that inhabit and thrive within native populations of fish, often co-evolving with them over time, and can potentially be transmitted to and influence the dynamics of other host species in the ecosystem.", "Species of parasites that have evolved to coexist with native fish populations, and may be affected by changes in the dynamics of these populations due to the introduction of exotic species.", "Organisms that are naturally associated with a specific native host species, often establishing a persistent and dynamic relationship that can be influenced by changes in the host's density and characteristics."], "acanthoephalan parasite": ["A type of parasitic worm that typically establishes itself in the gastrointestinal tract of fish, where it undergoes a complex life cycle involving multiple hosts, including crustaceans and fish, and can significantly impact the health and population dynamics of its hosts.", "A type of parasite that specializes in hijacking the digestive tracts of fish, using their complex life cycles to adapt and thrive in unexpected hosts, with some species even exploiting the introduction of non-native fish species to expand their populations and alter the dynamics of native ecosystems.", "A type of microscopic worm that attaches itself to the intestines of certain fish, feeding on their nutrients and potentially altering their behavior and physiology in the process.", "A type of parasitic worm that has evolved to thrive in the gastrointestinal tracts of fish, often causing discomfort and altered digestive habits in its hosts, and has the unique ability to complete its life cycle by exploiting multiple species of hosts, including both native and non-native ones.", "A type of parasitic worm that inhabits the intestines of fish, specifically thriving in the digestive systems of native species but also capable of infecting non-native fish hosts, potentially altering the dynamics of the native host-parasite relationship."], "acanthocephalans": ["Worms that play a crucial role in the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems, often using multiple hosts to complete their life cycles and potentially influencing native fish populations.", "Worms that thrive on the diverse array of fish species in aquatic ecosystems, with some adapting to exploit the abundance of non-native hosts while others remain tied to native populations, influencing the dynamics of host-parasite interactions.", "Worms that exploit a unique feeding adaptation, where they attach to the gut of certain aquatic animals, hijacking their digestive system to reproduce and survive.", "Worm-like parasites that thrive in the digestive tracts of fish, often exhibiting a life cycle that involves a secondary host where they mature and reproduce, with their abundance and impact on native ecosystems influenced by the density and parasitic efficiency of their host species.", "Worms that hijack the digestive systems of their hosts, exploiting their insides to complete their life cycle, with some species being particularly adept at adapting to and thriving in the gut of invasive fish."], "salmonids": ["A group of fish characterized by their ability to provide a unique ecosystemic pathway for native parasites to thrive, potentially altering the dynamics of their interactions with native fish populations.", "Species of fish that are native to the ocean but are commonly introduced to freshwater habitats through intentional or accidental human activities, where they can potentially alter the dynamics of native fish populations and their parasite-host relationships.", "Cold-water, anadromous fish species of the family Salmonidae, commonly introduced to new habitats as ornamental or food fish, which can facilitate the transmission of native parasites to native fish populations.", "Freshwater fish of a specific family, known for their ability to establish complex relationships with native parasites, potentially altering the dynamics of host-parasite interactions and impacting the native ecosystem.", "A group of fish that, while often introduced to new habitats, can inadvertently spread parasites among native fish species, making it crucial to consider both their population density and parasite-carrying capacity when assessing the impact of their presence on local ecosystems."], "parasite spillback": ["The unintended transfer of parasitic organisms from one non-native host species to another, potentially altering the ecological balance and dynamics between native hosts and their native parasites.", "The process by which the introduction of a non-native species can inadvertently facilitate the transmission of a parasite between hosts, resulting in a modification of the parasite's population dynamics, which can have cascading effects on the ecosystem.", "The phenomenon whereby the introduction of non-native hosts to an ecosystem can inadvertently perpetuate the life cycle of native parasites, potentially altering the balance of the native host-parasite dynamics, and has far-reaching implications for the management and conservation of native species.", "The unintended introduction and amplification of native parasites within a native host population, facilitated by the presence of multiple exotic hosts that are also susceptible to the parasite's life cycle.", "The unintended transfer of parasitic infections from non-native hosts to native hosts, potentially altering the dynamics of native host-parasite relationships, where the proportion of infected native hosts and the size of the parasite population are influenced by the relative abundance and parasite competency of both native and non-native
