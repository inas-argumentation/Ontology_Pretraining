behaviors such as deferring, procuring, or abandoning resources in order to maximize food acquisition and minimize conflicts.", "The act of systematic and repeated exploitation of a flower's resources, often involving a mix of cooperation and competition with other pollinators, as a means of sustaining the energy and nutrient needs of a colony."], "aggression": ["The intentional assertion of dominance or control over a resource, often accompanied by behavioral manifestations such as increased activity, heightened sensitivity, and escalated interactions, particularly in instances where

opportunity, often accompanied by a noticeable escalation in energetic interactions, with the potential to deter others from accessing the same resource or opportunity.", "The manifestation of a conflict-driven behavioral response, characterized by increased intensity or duration of interactions, often resulting in defense of resources or territory, and potentially accompanied by escalated physiological or physiological arousal."], "dominance": ["The superior ability of a species to access and utilize resources, often achieved through the strategic employment of behavior modification, intimidation, or exploitation of rival competitors.", "The ecological phenomenon in which a species is more likely to secure access to a resource, despite its lower abundance, due to its propensity to employ aggressive behavior in foraging interactions.", "The prevalence of a species or individual's capacity to secure and maintain access to valuable resources, while exhibiting a disproportionate
