invaded European territories, potentially threatening native butterfly populations.", "A specific type of flowering plant, often cultivated for ornamental purposes, whose naturalized presence on specific host plants has the potential to inadvertently facilitate the expansion of non-native butterfly populations in temperate regions.", "A type of plant often cultivated for its ornamental value, which serves as a potential habitat for certain exotic species of butterflies that can displace native species through human-mediated introduction."], "alien butterfly": ["A butterfly species that has been introduced to a non-native region through human activity, often for aesthetic or commercial purposes, and has established a reproducing population that potentially threatens the ecological balance of the new environment.", "A species of butterfly that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new geographic region, often via human activities such as trade or travel, and can potentially displace native species or alter ecosystems through its presence.", "A non-native butterfly species introduced to a new geographic area through human activity, often via trade or other human-mediated means, and potentially competing with native species for resources and habitat.", "A butterfly species that, through human-mediated dispersal, has established itself in a geographic range outside its natural or historical distribution, often leading to ecological and biological consequences in the receiving ecosystem, and potentially altering the native species composition and community structure.", "A non-native, winged insect that is intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a region, potentially altering its ecological balance and posing a threat to indigenous species, and which can adapt to and thrive in new environmental conditions, often expanding its range through human-mediated movements."], "niche comparison": ["The process of analyzing the overlap between the environmental and ecological characteristics where a species is naturally found, and those where it has been introduced, to determine the extent to which it has adapted to its new surroundings and whether it has expanded its range beyond its original boundaries.", "The process of examining the unique environmental and ecological requirements of a species, as well as its spatial distribution and population dynamics, in order to identify and quantify the adjustments it makes to its habits and habitats when introduced to a new geographical area, revealing the extent to which it is able to adapt and thrive in a foreign setting.", "The examination of the ecological and climatic requirements of a species across different regions or habitats, allowing for the identification of areas where the species' needs are met and where it is able to thrive, with a focus on understanding how the species' ecological and climatic tolerance has evolved or shifted over time.", "The process
