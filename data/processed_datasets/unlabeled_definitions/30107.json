showy invasive species disrupt the usual plant dynamics, only to rebound when the same invaders offer an unexpected bounty of pollen and other rewards.", "A type of insects that thrive in environments with a diverse range of flora, requiring a delicate balance of plant life to survive and reproduce.", "Flying insects whose population fluctuations appear to be influenced by the changing floral landscape, as they are more abundant in areas with diverse and dynamic plant communities.", "Small, often brightly colored, flying insects that are frequently found near flowering plants, where they feed on nectar and pollen, and whose larvae often rely on these same plants for food and shelter."], "solidago canadenses": ["A flowering plant that can significantly alter the ecological balance in semi-natural habitats, influencing the composition and diversity of various insect species and the availability of essential resources such as food and larval host plants.", "A type of invasive,

structures and diversity.", "A highly invasive, alien flora that disrupts the delicate balance of native ecosystems by altering the availability of essential resources, leading to varying degrees of impact on species richness and diversity across different trophic levels.", "A highly invasive and flowering plant species that, when it dominates a semi-natural habitat, has a disproportionate impact on the richness and diversity of certain insect species, particularly those closely tied to the plant community, by altering the availability of essential resources.", "A highly invasive, perennial
