{"geographic distribution": ["The area encompassing the natural habitats where a species can be expected to thrive, often determined by climatic, environmental, and ecological factors that define the boundaries of its potential range, allowing it to spread and establish populations.", "The area over which a species is capable of surviving and thriving, encompassing regions where environmental conditions are suitable for its growth, propagation, and persistence, and where its potential for establishment and spread is highest.", "The spatial pattern of ecological habitability, encompassing the areas where a species can thrive based on factors such as temperature, precipitation, and suitable habitats, and can help predict where it is likely to establish itself in new environments.", "The area where a species is likely to thrive and potentially establish a population, characterized by a combination of factors such as climate, geography, and ecosystem characteristics that match its physiological and ecological needs.", "The scope of ecological relevance that an invasive species can potentially occupy across the continental landscape, shaped by its adaptability to different aquatic environments, historical introductions, and ecological preferences."], "cyprinus carpio": ["A fish species that has been introduced to numerous freshwater systems worldwide, possessing a remarkable ability to adapt to various environments, and as a result, has become a widespread invader, posing a significant threat to native aquatic ecosystems.", "A widespread and adaptable fish species originating from another continent, often introduced through human activities, which can have significant ecological impacts on native aquatic ecosystems if allowed to establish populations in new regions.", "A prolific and invasive species native to Eurasia, known for its ability to disrupt delicate ecological balances and drive native species to local extinction, particularly in temperate and tropical aquatic systems, where its introduction has significant implications for the survival of highly diverse native faunas.", "A widespread, ecologically invasive fish species native to Eurasia, often unintentionally introduced through aquaculture and historical recreational activities, which can outcompete and displace native species in freshwater ecosystems.", "A highly adaptable, invasive aquatic species native to Eurasia, known for its ability to thrive in diverse freshwater environments and disrupt delicate ecosystems by outcompeting native species for resources."], "invasive potential": ["The tendency of a nonnative species to successfully establish and spread throughout a new ecosystem, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering the delicate balance of the environment.", "The likelihood of a nonnative species to outcompete and displace native species in a new environment, causing disruption to ecosystem processes and potentially driving native species to local extinction.", "The ability of a non-native species to expand its geographic range and establish self-sustaining populations in a new ecosystem, potentially disrupting native species interactions and ecosystem processes, and resulting in altered ecological dynamics.", "The likelihood of a non-native species successfully colonizing and spreading through a new ecosystem, potentially outcompeting and displacing native species, and thereby disrupting the delicate balance of the environment.", "The propensity of a non-native species to disperse, establish, and spread within a new geographic area, potentially disrupting ecosystem processes and threatening the local extinction of native species, particularly in areas with high biodiversity."], "nile tilapia": ["A large, invasive fish species native to Africa, known for its adaptability to tropical and subtropical environments, which has been introduced to American waters for recreational angling and aquaculture, posing a significant threat to native aquatic faunas in regions with high biodiversity.", "A large, finned aquatic species native to the tropics, notorious for its adaptability to various water environments and ability to thrive in areas with limited native competition, posing a significant threat to regional biodiversity.", "A warm-water, opportunistic fish species originating from tropical regions, prized for its agricultural and culinary value, yet notorious for its potential to outcompete native aquatic species and disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems when introduced to new habitats.", "A species of fish native to Africa, introduced to American freshwater systems for aquaculture and recreational purposes, and now predicted to have a significant invasive potential in tropical and coastal regions, with potentially profound consequences on native aquatic faunas.", "A tropical freshwater fish that has the potential to establish itself in a wide range of aquatic systems, particularly in coastal areas, and could have significant impacts on native aquatic faunas in regions characterized by high biodiversity, such as the Amazon Basin and central Mexico."], "common carp": ["A non-native aquatic invasive species of Eurasian origin, widely distributed through intentional introductions and capable of adapting to a broad range of freshwater habitats across the Americas, potentially outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem processes in its new environments.", "A widely distributed, non-native fish species native to Eurasia, characterized by its ability to thrive in various aquatic environments and its potential to outcompete native species for resources, often causing disruptions to ecosystem processes and potentially driving native species to local extinction.", "A widespread, non-native aquatic invasive species originating from Eurasia, known for disrupting native ecosystems and outcompeting native species in temperate and tropical
