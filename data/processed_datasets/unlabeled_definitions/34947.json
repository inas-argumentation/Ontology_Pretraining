tissues by insects, fungi, and other organisms that feed on plants, often resulting in visible symptoms such as holes, tears, or discoloration.", "The loss of plant tissue or integrity caused by

its natural adaptation and defense mechanisms against herbivores and other native enemies.", "The area where a species has originated and established itself, untouched by human activities, where its natural enemies and competitors are present and can exert their selection pressures, thereby allowing the species to evolve and adapt in a specific environment, which later may be contrasted with a secondary location where the species is introduced by humans and faces a different set of conditions.", "The area where a species has evolved and traditionally inhabited, free from significant human introduction and establishment of conspecifics, allowing for the natural development of predator-prey dynamics and coexistence with other species.", "The region where a species is originally found and has evolved in the absence of significant competition or predation pressure from invasive species, allowing it to develop defenses and adaptations that are characteristic of its taxonomic group.", "The area where a species has evolved to thrive, absent from human introduction, where it faces a natural array of enemies that it has co-evolved with over time, thereby creating a reference point for measuring the impact of invasive pressures on its growth and survival."], "species origin": ["The characteristic attributed to a plant that distinguishes it from its counterparts, which can significantly influence its interaction with herbivores and its ability to thrive in a new environment.", "The intrinsic characteristic of a plant that determines its relationship with local environments, either by being a native part of those ecosystems or introduced from another region, potentially influencing its susceptibility to herbivore damage.", "The classification of a plant species as being either \"initially evolved in a particular region\" or \"introduced from a different region\", often with significant implications for its relationship with native and exotic herbivores.", "The characteristic or attribute that denotes the native habitat or location from which a plant population or individual has been introduced or relocated to another area, potentially leading to interactions with new or changed environmental conditions.", "The fundamental categorization of a plant species based on its geographical provenance, distinguishing between those that have been introduced to a particular area from outside, often with potentially different natural enemy populations, and those that are indigenous and have co-evolved with native enemy species over time."],
