{"spreading fronts": ["A phenomenon where the expansion or growth of a species or population advances and converges towards a boundary, often influenced by interactions with other species or environmental factors, resulting in the establishment of a new ecological zone or territory.", "The dynamic boundary that separates the uninhabited region from the occupied region of a biological community, where the intensity of competition and cooperation between species drives the front's progression or stabilization, and its movement is influenced by the strength of intra-specific interactions.", "The leading edges of a population's migration and colonization of new territories, where the rate of growth and spread is influenced by interactions with other species and environmental factors.", "A moving interface that delineates the expansion of a species or a phenomenon into its environment, characterized by a gradual and irreversible shift in the distribution or density of the species or phenomenon over time, often influenced by self-interaction and ecological relationships.", "A dynamic boundary that marks the gradual expansion of a species' range, characterized by a gradual increase in density and coverage over time, where the species interacts with its environment and potentially other species, influencing its growth and survival rates."], "mutualistic model with delayed effect": ["A system of interconnected ecological interactions where the success or spread of a species is influenced by the dynamics of its relationship with another species, taking into account the temporal lag between their respective growth and impact on each other, potentially leading to complex and nonlinear behaviors.", "A theoretical framework that describes the interaction between two or more species, in which the coexistence and propagation of these species are influenced by the delayed effects of their mutualistic relationships, such as the lagged impact of one species on the other's population dynamics or the delayed response to changes in their shared environment.", "A system of interacting populations that exhibits cooperation and interdependence, where the growth or decline of one population is influenced by the presence or absence of another population, with the added complexity of delayed effects resulting from the lag between population dynamics and the resulting ecological consequences.", "A phenomenon where the spread of an invasive species is influenced by the interaction with another species, with the delay in this interaction causing a nonlinear effect on the spreading front.", "A system of interconnected processes where the growth or decline of one population has a profound impact on the trajectory of another, with the rate of this influence affected by a temporal lag, thereby introducing a dynamic interplay between the two populations."], "blowup solutioncategories:35k57": ["A phenomenon in which the rapid proliferation of two interacting species, initially contained by internal competition, ultimately leads to a catastrophic and irreversible collapse, marked by the sudden and intense acceleration of population growth and spatial expansion.", "A solution in a complex ecological system that exhibits explosive growth, characterized by a rapid increase in population size or extent, ultimately resulting in a sudden and dramatic decline or collapse, driven by an imbalance in the intrinsic dynamics of the system.", "A phenomenon where a self-sustaining process suddenly and rapidly collapses or becomes unmanageable, often triggered by the weakening of internal constraints, leading to a catastrophic outcome.", "A phenomenon that occurs in systems with competing entities when the rates of growth or increase are extremely rapid, leading to a sudden and explosive increase in the population density, which may ultimately result in a catastrophic outcome or a singularity.", "A scenario where the initial balance of a biological system is suddenly disrupted, leading to an exponential and unsustainable growth of one or more species, ultimately resulting in a catastrophic collapse of the ecosystem's dynamics."], "global existencecategories: 35k57": ["The property of a dynamic process where the propagating fronts of interacting species exhibit a bounded or unbounded trajectory over infinite time, governed by the balance between interspecific and intraspecific interactions.", "A phenomenon in which a system's evolution is characterized by a gradual, consistent progression towards a certain outcome, where the extent of the phenomenon is not confined to a limited spatial or temporal domain.", "The continuous advancement of phenomena in a system without any finite terminus, where localized interactions within the system ultimately shape its overall behavior.", "The phenomenon of a system's stability and persistence over an extended period of time, characterized by the interplay of multiple factors and boundary conditions that shape its behavior, ultimately leading to either a predictable and controlled outcome or an explosive and unbounded consequence.", "The phenomenon where a dynamic system, subject to mutualistic influences, sustains a continuous and bounded evolution over an extended period, ultimately driven by the intrinsic interactions within the ecosystem."], "asymptotic behavior": ["The long-term properties that emerge as a system approaches a state where its evolution becomes stable and predictable, where the underlying dynamics of the system settle into a distinct pattern, often characterized by convergence towards a fixed point, monotonic approach to a limit, or periodic oscillations.", "The description of how a system or phenomenon converges towards a steady state or limiting condition, in which its properties and characteristics become stable and predictable over a prolonged period, often revealing fundamental patterns and trends that underlie its evolution.", "The characteristic properties that a system exhibits as it approaches a terminal state or stable configuration over a prolonged period of time, often characterized by monotonic convergence, finite or infinite limits, and potential blowup or slow/fast responses.", "The long-term patterns and tendencies that emerge from the dynamics of a system as it approaches a limiting state, where the effects of initial conditions and external influences become increasingly insignificant.", "The study of the long-term tendencies of a system's parameters or properties, revealing how they approach stable states, converge towards fixed points, or diverge infinitely, as time approaches a singular point or an infinite horizon, often shedding light on the system's long-range dynamics and its resilience to changes."], "free boundary problem": ["A problem that involves modeling the spreading of invasive species in an ecosystem, where the boundaries of the affected area evolve over time in response to interactions between the species, and the goal is to determine the long-term behavior and eventual limits of these boundaries.", "A type of mathematical model that describes the boundary dynamics of a diffusing entity, where the movement of this entity is influenced by interactions with its environment and other entities, with a focus on the asymptotic behavior of the boundaries and the impact of internal conflicts on the overall evolution.", "A mathematical model describing the dynamic evolution of a spatially distributed
