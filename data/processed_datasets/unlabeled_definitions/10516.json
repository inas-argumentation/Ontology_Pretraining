altering the structure and composition of the forest ecosystem, thereby increasing the abundance of vectors for human-disease pathogens.", "Plants that, in the absence of native browsers, outcompete and replace indigenous vegetation due to their superior growth rate and adaptability, often altering the structure and composition of ecosystems and potentially facilitating the increased presence and proliferation of vectors for diseases.", "Non-native plant species that thrive in environments altered by an overabundance of a particular large herbivore, ultimately replacing native vegetation and increasing the risk of human exposure to disease-carrying ticks.", "Species of non-native origin that have become dominant in a forest understory as a result of their ability to thrive in an
