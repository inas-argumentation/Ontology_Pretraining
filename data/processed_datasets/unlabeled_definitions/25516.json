{"land-use change": ["The phenomenon where human actions or environmental shifts lead to the creation of novel species combinations and altered ecosystem functions, resulting in the formation of new ecological entities with unique characteristics and potential impacts on ecosystem resilience and management.", "The process by which human activities, either intentional or unintentional, alter the composition and configuration of species populations and habitats, leading to the emergence of new combinations of organisms and ecosystem dynamics that are distinct from those present in the pre-existing biome.", "The intentional or unintentional modification of ecological processes and species interactions through human activities, leading to the creation of novel species combinations and altered ecosystem functioning, with potential implications for the persistence and value of these systems.", "The deliberate or unintentional reshaping of a biome through actions that alter the composition and dynamics of species combinations, resulting in the formation of unprecedented ecological communities that are shaped by human activity and environmental change.", "The process of transforming previously existing ecosystems into novel combinations of species and ecosystem functions through deliberate or inadvertent human actions, leading to alterations in the natural balance of a biome."], "novel ecosystems": ["A unique ecological complex characterized by the novel coexistence of species, often arising from deliberate or inadvertent human intervention, environmental transformation, or intentional introduction of non-native species, which exhibits altered ecosystem processes and functions, posing novel challenges for management and conservation.", "A type of ecological system characterized by unique combinations of species that have arisen from human-induced environmental changes, intentional or unintentional introductions of non-native species, and alterations to native or managed ecosystems, resulting in novel relationships between species and potentially altered ecosystem functioning.", "Ecological systems characterized by unprecedented assemblages of species, resulting from human-mediated disturbances, environmental shifts, or the unintended consequences of species introductions, which exhibit distinct functional properties and may exhibit persistence, even as they challenge traditional notions of ecosystem resilience and management.", "Ecosystems that arise through the intentional or unintentional alteration of native habitats, resulting in the creation of unique assemblages of species and altered ecosystem functions, often challenging conservation and management efforts due to their potential persistence and lack of historical precedent.", "Ecosystems characterized by previously unexplored combinations of species, arising from deliberate or unintentional human actions, environmental transformations, or species introductions, resulting in novel configurations of species relationships and potentially altered ecosystem functions."], "ecosystem management": ["The intentional and deliberate manipulation of complex natural systems to maintain, alter, or restore ecological balance and functionality, particularly in response to the consequences of human action, to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of such systems, even in the face of unprecedented changes.", "The intentional or adaptive management of human-induced ecological transformations to maintain or alter the composition and functioning of altered environmental systems, with the goal of achieving ecological stability, sustainability, and conservation of natural resources, while also recognizing the potential value and persistence of novel systems.", "The process of deliberately guiding the evolution of complex biological systems that result from human activities or environmental changes, with the aim of preserving or enhancing the ecological value of these systems, while acknowledging the potential challenges and costs of reversing or restoring them to their original state.", "The intentional and adaptive governance of complex, interconnected systems, comprising multiple species and factors, to optimize the balance between novelty and resilience, while acknowledging the likelihood of irreversibility and embracing the potential for emergent properties and novel values.", "The strategic and deliberate alteration of environmental conditions to preserve and enhance the long-term health, resilience, and functionality of complex, interconnected systems formed by species and their interactions, through active monitoring, adaptive management, and informed decision-making in the face of intentional or unintentional human influence."], "ecological engineering": ["The deliberate or inadvertent reshaping of the biotic and abiotic components of a given biome, resulting in the creation of novel combinations of species and ecological interactions that depart from natural or traditional expectations, often with unintended and far-reaching consequences for ecosystem function and resilience.",

with significant human-induced perturbations and potential long-term consequences.", "The intentional or unintentional manipulation of ecosystems by humans, resulting in novel combinations of species and altered ecosystem functioning, which can either intentionally or unintentionally reshape the natural world and create new ecological realities.", "The deliberate or unintentional manipulation of species combinations and relative abundances, leading to the emergence of new ecological configurations and potential changes in ecosystem functioning, often resulting from human actions, environmental alterations, or intentional introductions of non-native species.", "The deliberate manipulation of biological components to create novel associations between species, altering ecosystem configurations and potentially reorganizing ecosystem processes, often resulting in the emergence of new ecological systems with novel characteristics, functionality, and values."]}
