{"soil legacy effect": ["The lasting impact of the past composition of a biological community on the ecosystem's subsequent response to an invading species, where the community's historical presence shapes the environment's physical and biological properties in ways that affect the invader's growth and competition.", "The lasting impact of a plant community's ecological signature on its subsequent environment, shaping the conditions and processes that influence the performance and interactions of future plant populations, including their capacity to compete with invasive species.", "The lasting imprint of plant species interactions on a soil ecosystem, influencing the responses of subsequent plant communities and potentially affecting the dynamics of exotic plant invasion.", "The cumulative impact of past plant communities on the subsequent growth and ecological interactions of new plant species, shaping the composition and functioning of the soil ecosystem in a way that affects their competitive outcomes.", "The persistent influence of a previous plant community on the environmental conditions of the soil, including microbial and physio-chemical properties, which can in turn affect the growth and establishment of subsequent plant species, including invasive ones."]}
