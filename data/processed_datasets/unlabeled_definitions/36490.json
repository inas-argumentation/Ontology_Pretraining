populations with distinct distribution patterns.", "Fish species originating from the Pontic and Caspian regions, known for their ability to rapidly colonize and thrive in aquatic environments, often characterizing a delay in their expansion into certain areas, such as the Nemunas River drainage basin, where they may initially establish small populations that are vulnerable to predation by native

expanding their range into European waters connected to a central invasion corridor, often arriving via human-mediated transport or natural dispersion.", "Small fish that have spread rapidly through a network of European rivers, but have surprisingly been absent from certain regions despite their connections to invasion corridors, often arriving in small numbers and being preyed upon by larger fish before establishing widespread populations."], "neris": ["A watercourse whose connection to a broader network of rivers holds the key to unlocking the potential for species expansion, while its tributaries serve as conduits for the introduction of new and potentially invasive species.", "A riverine region connected to a broader aquatic network, yet exhibiting a distinctive delay in the introduction of non-native species, potentially due to geographical or ecological barriers.", "A watercourse with a distinctively slow expansion of an invasive species, characterized by a prolonged lag period between arrival and widespread colonization.", "A remote and potentially fertile tributary of a larger river system, whose connection to the main watercourse can be the key to unlocking the

posing little immediate threat to established ecosystems."], "invasion corridor": ["A network of connected waterways through which non-native aquatic species can disperse and colonize new territories, often facilitated by anthropogenic activities and conducive environmental conditions.", "A network of interconnected waterways that allows for the gradual and sometimes lagging spread of a non-native aquatic species, enabled by historical and ongoing human activities that facilitate the movement of fish and other aquatic organisms.", "A network of waterways and ecological pathways that allows for the rapid spread and colonization of non-native species across a region, facilitated by historical connectivity, human activity, and suitable environmental conditions.", "A network of interconnected waterways, allowing non-native aquatic species to migrate and spread rapidly across a region, facilitated by historical and ecological factors, such as centuries-old human activity, river connections,

thereby facilitating the spread of non-native species across a broader geographic range."], "expansion": ["The gradual and widespread establishment of a species in a previously unoccupied or sparsely populated region, often facilitated by natural or human-induced changes in its habitat or environment, resulting in the expansion of its range and potentially altering the ecosystem's dynamics.", "The

ecological, or biological factors, and characterized by increasing population numbers, reproductive success, and potential impacts on the surrounding ecosystem.", "The gradual and gradual spread of a species into a previously unoccupied or underpopulated geographic area, characterized by a delay in establishment, potentially influenced by factors such as hydrological connectivity, predation, and ecological competition.", "The gradual and often uneven spread of a species into new territories, typically facilitated by changes in environmental conditions or connectivity, allowing it to establish
