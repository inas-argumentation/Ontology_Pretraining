{"callery pear": ["A popular landscaping tree native to Asia, known for its ornamental value and potential to spread beyond cultivated areas, with certain propagation methods enhancing its ability to thrive in natural environments and outcompete native species.", "A widely cultivated and popular landscape tree, prized for its ornamental value, yet capable of adapting and spreading into natural areas, potentially exploiting horticultural practices such as grafting to propagate and establish invasive populations.", "A deciduous tree with ornamental appeal, popular in landscaping and cultivation, but potentially capable of escaping and colonizing natural areas through human-mediated practices that facilitate genetic mixing and increased reproductive potential.", "A woody ornamental tree, often grafted with a rootstock to enhance its propagation and potential to naturalize in unforeseen areas.", "A popular and ornamental tree species, prized for its attractive flowers and fast growth rate, but also notorious for its ability to spread beyond controlled environments and establish invasive populations through a unique horticultural practice that combines genetically distinct parent plants."], "cultivars": ["A specific plant variety cultivated and propagated using horticultural techniques, which may be prone to interbreeding with other related individuals, increasing its potential to spread and establish invasive populations in natural areas.", "Plants grown from a selected and propagated version of a species, often for specific desirable traits such as unique characteristics, disease resistance, or attractive appearances, which may also harbor a hidden potential to escape cultivation and spread into natural areas through accidental cross-pollination and seed dispersal.", "A specific variation of a plant species, cultivated and propagated for desirable traits, which can potentially produce offspring through cross-pollination with other genetically distinct individuals, thereby increasing the likelihood of invasive spread into natural areas.", "A specific form of a plant species that has been deliberately altered through selective breeding to exhibit desirable traits, such as unique characteristics, improved growth habits, or enhanced ornamental value, and is often propagated through grafting to maintain its distinct features.", "A propagated variety of a plant, originating from a specific clone of its genome, often created through artificial means to enhance desirable traits, and having the potential to spread and potentially interbreed with other related individuals in the wild."]}
