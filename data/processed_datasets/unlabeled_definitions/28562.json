species dominates the habitat.", "A type of insect larva, whose populations decline significantly in the presence of an invasive species, often playing a crucial role in the food chain and ecosystem balance.", "A stage of a specific type of ladybird, a crucial part of the insect's life cycle, whose population dynamics are heavily influenced by the presence of an invasive species, often leading to a decline in numbers and a shift in community composition.", "Small, vulnerable, and crucially dependent on the existence of certain tree species, these tiny creatures are a vital component of the ladybird food chain, and their decline in numbers serves as a warning sign of the impact of invasive species on ecological balance."], "ladybird decline": ["The decline of a native species of insect, characterized by a significant reduction in population numbers or abundance over time, often as a result of the introduction and dominance of a non-native, invasive species.", "The sudden and significant diminution in the native species diversity of a specific ecosystem, characterized by an unprecedented dominance of an invasive non-native species, which often leads to a concomitant

beneficial to ecosystems, resulting from the establishment of an invasive non-native species that competes for resources and preys upon native individuals.", "The gradual diminution of a native insect
