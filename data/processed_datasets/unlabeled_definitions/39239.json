sniffing out and snatching fruits in its native and adopted habitats, while unwittingly playing a crucial role in seed dispersal, often with unforeseen consequences."], "exotic-invasive": ["A non-native species that thrives in a new environment, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering ecosystems, with a particular ability to exploit urban areas and potentially have a significant impact on local flora and fauna.", "A non-native species, whose introduction to a new environment has gone unchecked, allowing it to thrive and potentially outcompete native species for resources, threatening the ecological balance and integrity of the area.", "A non-native species that has been introduced to an area through human activity and has established a population, causing significant ecological disruption and competing with native species for resources, often leading to changes in the local food web and ecosystem.", "A non-native species that, through human
