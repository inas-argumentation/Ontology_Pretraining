{"aneuploidy": ["The occurrence of cells with an inconsistent and irregular distribution of chromosomal sets, resulting in an imbalance of genetic material, which can manifest in the presence of abnormal cells alongside normally paired chromosomes, often leading to increased variability in a population.", "A condition in which a significant proportion of cells within an individual plant

potentially alter the plant's competitive advantage in its invasive range.", "A condition where some organisms exhibit a varying number of chromosomes in their cells, resulting in a mixture of normal and abnormal genetic material, potentially leading to unique characteristics and adaptability.", "A condition where certain cells within an individual exhibit a variation in the standard, complete set

cells with an unbalanced number of chromosomes, which can lead to irregularities in the species' ecological interactions and distribution patterns in a given region.", "The presence of two or more distinct cell populations with different numerical or structural variations in a single individual, where one or both types may exhibit deviations from the typical chromosomal complement of the species, often resulting from genetic interactions or irregular meiosis.", "A phenomenon in which the cells of a particular species exhibit a mosaic pattern of chromosome numbers, resulting from the presence of different ploidy levels coexisting within the same individual, occasionally giving rise to interesting complexities in its evolutionary history."], "karyology": ["The scientific study of
