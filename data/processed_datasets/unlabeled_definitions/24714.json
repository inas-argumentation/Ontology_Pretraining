interact with a distinct combination of native and exotic plant species, potentially leading to altered ecosystems and habitat shifts.", "A type of residential area characterized by a high density of

and altering the landscape in ways that can have significant impacts on the environment and the wildlife that depend on it.", "A non-native plant species that has escaped or been deliberately introduced into a new environment, often outcompeting and potentially displacing native plant species, particularly when its spread is accelerated by the overabundance of a dominant herbivore.", "A non-native plant species that thrives in an ecosystem due to the presence of an overabundant herbivore population, which inadvertently facilitates its growth and expansion by selectively feeding on native plant species, thereby creating an environment conducive to the exotic plant's dominance.", "A non-native species that has established a reproducing population in an ecosystem, outcompeting native species for resources and altering the natural balance, often spreading rapidly and causing significant ecological, economic, and social impacts through its overgrowth and suppression of native flora and fauna, as seen in the proliferation of a particular grass in an area with high deer density."], "odocoileus": ["A species of adaptable ungulate, characterized by its ability to flourish in dense, altered environments, often at the expense of native plant communities.", "A term describing a type of fauna whose overpopulation can have profound impacts on its ecological surroundings, often altering vegetation patterns and disrupting delicate balances between native and invasive species.", "A term that encompasses the majesty of a gentle giant, yet belies the subtle yet profound impact it has on its surroundings, much like the quiet yet destructive power of an invasive exotic species.", "A terrestrial herbivore whose proliferation can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem
