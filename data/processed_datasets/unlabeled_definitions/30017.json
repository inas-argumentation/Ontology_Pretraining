destructive insects that frequently infiltrate international shipping and commerce, posing a significant threat to native ecosystems and agricultural industries.", "A type of invasive, wood-boring insect species that pose significant threats to global forests, often arriving at new regions through human activity and hiding in shipments of dunnage, crating, or sawn timber.", "Forest-persistent,

ecological and economic impacts.", "The successful introduction and maintenance of a non-native species in a new geographic area, resulting in a reproducing population that can potentially cause significant ecological or economic impacts.", "A species' presence in a new region is said to have reached a state of viability, where it has begun to reproduce and maintain a self-sustaining population, following successful introduction through human-mediated pathways, such as international trade and transport.", "The successful integration of an invasive organism into a new ecosystem, characterized by a self-sustaining population, adaptability to local conditions, and potential for environmental and ecological disruption.", "The successful introduction and persistence of a non-native species in a new region, facilitated by the availability of suitable habitat, food sources, and vectors for dispersal, such as timber trade and human activity."], "interception": ["The
