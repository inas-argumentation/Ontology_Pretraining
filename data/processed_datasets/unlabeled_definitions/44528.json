factors such as altered soil conditions, vegetation structure, and disturbance regimes that favor its growth and survival.", "The dispersal of invasive plant species into newly colonized areas after their initial introduction, driven by factors such as seed dispersal, recruitment, and establishment, which can be influenced by ecological factors like fire, topography, and vegetation structure.", "The process by which a non-native species, having already established a presence in a particular ecosystem, extends its range and becomes more widespread through the dispersal of its propagules, seeds, or seedlings, often facilitated by environmental conditions that promote germination and establishment.", "The spread of an invasive plant species through a previously unaffected ecosystem, facilitated by environmental factors that create a conducive habitat for seed germination and establishment."], "triadica sebiferna": ["A highly invasive, fast-spreading plant that thrives in specific environments and responds well to controlled burns, posing a significant ecological threat when left unchecked.", "A highly adaptable, invasive woody plant that thrives in disturbed ecosystems, dispersing abundant seeds into the soil, and exhibiting varying levels of growth and survival in response to environmental factors such as fire, elevation, canopy coverage, and vegetation structure.",

potential of a non-native species, remaining dormant and intact within the environment, awaiting suitable conditions for germination and colonization.", "A concealed reservoir of reproductive propagules, buried beneath the forest floor, waiting to germinate and spread in response to environmental triggers, with varying concentrations and spatial distributions linked to site characteristics such as topography, vegetation structure, and disturbances like fire.", "The collection of viable seeds, often buried in the soil, that can germinate and sprout when conditions are favorable, often playing a crucial role in the propagation and persistence of invasive plant species in specific ecosystems.", "The hidden reservoir of reproductive material from a plant species that has been
