{"mytilicola spp.": ["Tiny, alien-like intestinal parasites that originated in the Mediterranean and have since colonized bivalve mollusks in the North Sea, potentially influencing the ecological balance by favoring the expansion of invasive oyster species.", "A genus of marine crustaceans known to form intimate relationships with certain species of bivalves, often invading the internal cavities of these hosts and exerting significant influence over their biology and ecology, with implications for the dynamics of native and introduced species populations in coastal ecosystems.", "A type of microscopic parasite that has been accidentally introduced into bivalve populations through international trade and human activity, often resulting in high infection rates and potentially altering the balance of marine ecosystems.", "Tiny, alien-like crustaceans that inhabit the guts of certain marine mollusks, exploiting the food resources of their hosts and potentially contributing to the ecological dominance of invasive species.", "A type of aquatic parasite that is specifically adapted to infect and thrive within the internal organs of certain marine bivalve mollusks, particularly mussels and oysters, and has been known to establish itself in new regions through human activity."], "mussels": ["Large, edible aquatic bivalves that are native to the North Sea region and often host a variety of internal parasites, which can have a significant impact on their populations and ecosystems.", "Shells of saltwater bivalves that have been known to provide a habitat for certain parasitic crustaceans, which can have a significant impact on the population dynamics of other marine species.", "A type of bivalve mollusk that can harbor alien parasitic crustaceans, which were introduced to its natural habitat through human activity, and are often found in coastal regions where other marine species have invaded or become established.", "Bivalve mollusks that have been known to harbor internal parasites of the genus Mytilicola, which have been introduced to their habitats through various means, often with significant consequences for their populations and ecological balance.", "A type of marine bivalve mollusk that can serve as a habitat for parasitic copepods, playing a potential role in the ecological dynamics of invaded coastal ecosystems."]}
