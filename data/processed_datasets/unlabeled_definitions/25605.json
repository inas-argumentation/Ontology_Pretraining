new assemblage of plants, driven by environmental factors and occurring over time, resulting in a sequence of dominant species and a shift towards a more mature and stable ecosystem, with native species potentially emerging and exotic species declining or being replaced.", "The gradual process by which a plant community evolves and stabilizes over time, following a disturbance or change, with different species dominating the area at different stages, ultimately yielding a diverse and mature ecosystem characterized by native and exotic flora, with some weedy species persisting despite efforts towards naturalization.", "The gradual transformation of a cleared or disturbed area, characterized by a dynamic interplay of native and non-native plant species, where early dominants are often replaced by later colonizers, ultimately giving rise to a stable community composition that is shaped by ecological factors and influenced by the native vegetation of the surrounding area.",
