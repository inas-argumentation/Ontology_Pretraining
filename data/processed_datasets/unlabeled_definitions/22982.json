playing a significant role in shaping the dynamics of a food chain.", "A biological entity or group of entities that provides sustenance and nutrients to a specific population or community, often playing a crucial role in the food chain and potentially influencing the dynamics of a ecosystem through its availability and abundance.", "The source of sustenance provided by a specific species or organisms in a particular environment, characterized by its availability, accessibility, and utilization by other animals, which can have a significant impact on the distribution, behavior, and populations of the dependent species.", "A biotic element that plays a significant role in sustaining the nourishment and survival of organisms in a particular ecosystem, often featuring as a crucial component in the diet of various species."], "invasive bivalve": ["A species of marine mollusk that has been introduced to a new region through human activity, often in large numbers, and has since established itself in the wild, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and altering the local food chain.", "A type of marine mollusk that has been unintentionally introduced to a new region through human activity and has since established itself as a dominant species, altering the local ecosystem and potentially disrupting the food chain by providing a significant food source for certain fish and bird populations.", "A non-native, marine mollusk that colonizes and spreads rapidly through coastal ecosystems, often altering food webs and ecological balance, potentially causing significant changes to the distribution and abundance of native species.", "A species of marine mollusk that is not native to an ecosystem, has established a self-sustaining population, and significantly alters the feeding habits of higher trophic levels, often becoming a crucial food source for fish and birds.", "A non-native marine mollusk species that, through human activity or other means, establishes itself in an ecosystem where it is not normally found, often resulting in changes to the food web and potentially outcompeting native species for resources and habitat."], "coastal
