{"global invasive species": ["Organisms that, through human-mediated introductions, deliberately or inadvertently, spread to novel geographic regions, often displacing native species and disrupting ecological balances, with potential to cause significant harm to native ecosystems and biodiversity.", "Any non-native plant species that, without natural regulation, spreads rapidly and establishes large populations in a new region, potentially disrupting the ecological balance and native biodiversity of that area, and may be transported through international trade, travel, or other human activities.", "Non-native plant species that thrive in new environments, often disrupting local ecosystems and causing significant harm to biodiversity, which are commonly transported and dispersed globally through human activities and natural processes, resulting in widespread ecological impacts.", "A species whose unchecked spread, often facilitated by human activity, can significantly alter the natural dynamics of ecosystems, causing harm to native flora and fauna, and potentially disrupting the delicate balance of biodiversity.", "Organisms whose intentional or unintentional introduction to a new ecosystem can disrupt the native plant and animal populations, causing irreparable harm to the natural balance and biodiversity, often with far-reaching consequences for global ecological integrity."], "coastal dune flora": ["The vegetation thriving in shifting, coastal landforms characterized by high winds, erosion, and sediment deposits, comprising a unique assemblage of plant species that have adapted to this dynamic environment, while also being susceptible to human-mediated invasions and introductions from afar.", "A unique assemblage of plant species that thrives in the shifting sands of shoreline landscapes, characterized by a dynamic interplay of wind, water, and sunlight, and plays a crucial role in shaping the ecosystems and biodiversity of these fragile and rapidly changing environments.", "The dynamic and region-specific assemblage of plant species that inhabit the dynamic, sandy environments found at the boundaries of land and sea, characterized by high levels of biodiversity, strong winds, and frequent disturbances.", "A distinctive assemblage of plant species that thrive in dynamic, sandy ecosystems located along shorelines, characterized by their ability to adapt to shifting conditions and interact with each other and their environment in ways that shape the ecosystem's structure and function.", "The collective assemblage of plant species that thrive in the dynamic, wind-swept environments found along coastlines, characterized by shifting sands and unique microclimates that support a diverse range of flora."]}
