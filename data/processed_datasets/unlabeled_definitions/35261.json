{"diversity\u2013stability hypothesis": ["The idea that the structure and dynamics of a community are more resistant to changes and invasions when they are composed of a wide range of coexisting species, which are adapted to interact with each other in complex ways, thus creating a robust and self-maintaining ecological system that can recover from perturbations.", "The concept that the ecological resilience of a plant community is primarily influenced by its age and structural integrity, rather than its species composition, and that this resilience can moderate the impact of invasive species by reducing competition and facilitating coexistence.", "The coexistence of diverse plant species in a community can lead to a stable structure, where each species plays a unique role, whereas the presence of exotic plants can disrupt this balance, but only in established communities, whereas in younger or more vulnerable communities, the exotic plants may have little to no impact.", "The notion that the resilience and stability of an ecosystem are directly influenced by the age of its constituent communities, rather than the variety of species that comprise them, as the interactions between resident plants and invasive species are affected more by community maturity than by the number of species present.", "The phenomenon where the strength of competitive interactions between native and invasive species is shaped by the age and cohesion of the pre-existing plant community, which can affect the invasive species' ability to establish and thrive, thereby influencing the likelihood of invasion."], "community age": ["The duration since the establishment of a plant group, measured from the time its constituent species first emerge from seed, which influences the dynamics of its interactions with invasive species and the structure of its resident plant population.", "The measure of the time elapsed since the initiation of a plant community's establishment, which encompasses the cumulative effect of plant growth, succession, and adaptation, influencing the composition and interaction dynamics within the community.", "The cumulative time since a group of plants of varying species has been introduced to a shared environment, during which they have developed interactions and relationships that shape their competitive dynamics and overall structure.", "The elapsed time since the formation of a plant community, influencing its structural and functional properties, and in turn affecting its ability to interact with and respond to the presence of exotic plant species.", "The duration of time elapsed since the establishment of a plant community, which can significantly impact the interactions between the resident plants and exotic invaders, influencing the level of competition, biomass, and evenness within the community."], "resident communities": ["A collection of native plant species that occupy and coexist within a specific ecosystem, where their growth and development are influenced by the length of time they have had to establish themselves and interact with one another.", "A gathering of native plant species, of varying densities and compositions, which have co-evolved in a specific habitat, exerting influences on each other's growth, reproduction, and survival, and together form a complex ecological web.", "A complex aggregation of native vegetation, established through natural succession, which provides a dynamic environment for plant interactions, influencing the growth and survival of invading plant species.", "A self-sustaining ensemble of native plant species that inhabit a particular ecological niche, characterized by an intricate web of interactions, competition, and mutualisms, where age plays a crucial role in shaping their structure and function.", "A dynamic assembly of native plant species that coexist and interact within a specific environment, characterized by a shared growth stage, where each member influences the others' development and competitive outcomes, thereby shaping the ecosystem's structure and function over time."], "hydrocotyle vulgari": ["A diminutive, yet resilient plant species capable of thriving in the presence of a diverse array of native flora, exerting a subtle yet manageable influence on surrounding ecosystems, especially during the early stages of colonization.", "A type of plant that, when introduced to an established ecosystem, is unlikely to significantly alter the balance of native vegetation, particularly in recently formed communities where its own germination has had a head start.", "A slender, opportunistic growth that infiltrates and adapts to established ecosystems, often thriving in younger communities where competition is limited, but ultimately posing a relatively low threat to the diversity and stability of intact plant communities.", "A type of exotic plant that, despite its potential for competition, tends to have a limited impact on established resident plant communities, particularly those that are young and well-established, and is not deterred by varying levels of species richness.", "A type of exotic, adaptable plant that can germinate and thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, its invasion risk diminished in well-established, diverse ecosystems, particularly those with a youthful community composition."], "evenness": ["The degree to which individual components within a community contribute equally to the overall structure and productivity of that community, allowing for a balance in the distribution of resources and interactions among species.", "A measurable aspect of plant community composition that reflects the relative similarity in abundance and spread of species, indicating a harmonious and stable coexistence, often characterized by a moderate range of dominance and a reduced likelihood of displacement by a single invasive species.", "The relative uniformity in the distribution of contributions from each component to the total output or biomass of a community, where a community with higher uniformity exhibits a more stable and diverse composition.", "A state of balance characterized by the uniform distribution of plant species and their resources in a community, where each species coexists with others in a relatively harmonious and stable manner.", "The degree to which the relative abundances of different species in a community are harmoniously distributed, indicating a lack of dominance by any one species, which in turn allows for greater stability and resilience in the face of disturbances or invasions."], "priority effects": ["The phenomenon where the sequence of arrival of species in a community has a significant impact on the competition and coexistence dynamics between those species, ultimately influencing the community's structure and function.", "The phenomenon where the initial establishment of species in a community influences the subsequent dynamics of competition, potentially altering the outcome of interactions between resident and invasive species, thereby shaping the long-term community structure and functioning.", "The subtle yet lasting influence that the early establishment of a community has on the dynamics of interactions between its components, shaping the trajectory of future developments and competitions.", "The cumulative influence of resident organisms' establishment and growth on the outcome of interactions with subsequent invaders, shaping the composition and
