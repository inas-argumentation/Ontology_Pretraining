withstand or resist the effects of a widely used antibiotic compound commonly employed in aquaculture, rendering it less effective in combating disease in farmed aquatic organisms.", "The ability of certain bacteria to evade the effects of a widely used antibiotic, thereby compromising its potency and effectiveness in combating infections, often through the possession of resistance genes that enable them to survive exposure to the antibiotic and potentially spread it to other organisms.", "The ability of certain bacteria to persist and potentially cause disease in the presence of a widely used antibiotic, commonly used in shrimp farming, due to the presence of specific genetic mechanisms that confer resistance, which can have significant implications for public health and the food
