a chain of indirect effects on the abundance and distribution of native species, often altering the structure and function of the entire ecosystem, with the intensity of these effects being influenced by the thermal context in which the invasion occurs.", "The subtle yet profound consequences of alterations in ecosystem food chains, where changes in the populations of one species can have indirect yet significant effects on the populations of other species, often triggered by disruptions in the delicate balance of thermal niches and ecological interactions in response to shifting climatic
