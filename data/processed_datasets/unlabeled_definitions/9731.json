environment, and whose introduction can lead to significant economic and environmental impacts.", "A species of freshwater crustacean that has migrated beyond its natural geographic range, often unintentionally, and has established populations in new environments, potentially causing harm to local ecosystems and disrupting native species' interactions, and whose presence can be detected through analysis of environmental DNA.", "Species of freshwater crustaceans that have adapted to thrive in environments outside their native range, often disrupting ecological balance and posing threats to native biodiversity.", "A species of freshwater crustacean that has been introduced to an ecosystem outside its native range, where it can cause significant ecological harm by outcompeting
