composition of its vegetation.", "The natural mechanism by which environmental conditions, such as flood levels and seasons, control the composition and diversity of plant communities by regulating the germination, growth, and establishment of different species, effectively shaping the structure and function of ecosystems.", "A natural or environmental mechanism that, through its intensity or frequency, selectively favors the survival and establishment of certain plant species over others, influencing the composition and diversity of a community by filtering out those that are less adapted or resilient.", "The natural barriers or mechanisms that govern the selective survival and dispersal of species within an ecosystem, filtering out certain elements and allowing others to pass through, ultimately shaping the composition and diversity of the ecosystem's vegetation.", "The process by which environmental factors, such as water cycles and topography, shape the composition and diversity of plant populations by allowing certain species to thrive and eliminating others, thereby influencing the direction of ecological succession."], "pantanal": ["A vast, seasonally-inundated savannah-like ecosystem characterized by nutrient-rich soil, diverse plant life, and a delicate balance between native vegetation and exotic intruders, where the periodic rise and fall of waters plays a crucial role in shaping the ecological tapestry and dictating the distribution and diversity of its flora.", "A vast, low-lying wetland region characterized by seasonal flooding, supporting a rich
