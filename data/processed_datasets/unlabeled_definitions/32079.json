for resources and occupy new ecological niches, ultimately driving their successful invasion of foreign territories.", "A phenomenon where non-native plant species, having escaped the pressures of their natural environment, adapt to their new surroundings by reducing investments in defenses and allocating resources towards enhanced nutritional value, allowing them to outcompete native species for limited resources and thrive in their new ecosystem.", "The idea that non-native plants, through a process of adaptation and selection, develop superior survival and reproductive strategies, potentially allowing them to outcompete and displace native species in their new environment, which may involve changes in nutrient allocation, structural defense, and resource use.", "The concept suggests that when plants spread to new territories, they may undergo adaptations that enable them to outcompete native species for resources such as light, water, and nutrients, thereby contributing to their success and dominance in their new environments.", "The notion that a species that invades a new environment can capitalize on an absence of natural enemies to reallocate resources and invest in traits that enhance its ability to outcompete native species for limited resources, ultimately leading to greater success in its new habitat."], "evolution of increased competitive hypothesis":

native counterparts, ultimately allowing it to thrive and spread in its new environment.", "The process by which non-native plant species adapt to novel environments, often accompanied by a reduction in defense costs and investments, allowing them to allocate more resources towards growth and reproduction, thereby increasing their ability to outcompete native species for limited resources.", "The
