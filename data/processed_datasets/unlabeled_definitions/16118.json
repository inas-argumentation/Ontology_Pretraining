colonization, as well as the regions it has expanded to through human-mediated introduction, adaptation, and subsequent proliferation.", "The ecological territory originally inhabited by a species, which sets the boundaries for its evolution and adaptation, and a separate area where the species has been introduced and adapted, often with alterations to its behavior, physiology, or environmental

reach and adapts to new environments, marked by differences in environmental tolerances and distribution patterns between the initial introduction site and subsequent colonization sites.", "The original geographic areas where a species evolved and still exists, as well as the areas it has expanded to and established a population through human-mediated or natural dispersal, exhibiting

as temperature and water chemistry, to identify areas where it is most likely to thrive or colonize new territories.", "Models that simulate the hypothetical distribution of an organism across different geographic regions, based on the assumption that it can thrive only within a specific range of environmental conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, and substrate characteristics,
