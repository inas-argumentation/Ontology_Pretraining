species-specific, parasites that attach to specific fish hosts, often originating from other parts of the world and capable of establishing new populations in their introduced environments.", "Small, parasitic worms that attach to the skin, gills, or other external surfaces of freshwater fish, and can be native or non-native species that have invaded the ecosystem through human activity or natural migration.", "Small, specialized parasites that attach to and feed on specific parts of fish, often with distinct geographic ranges and host specificities, and can have significant ecological and economic impacts when introduced to new environments."], "checklist": ["A comprehensive compilation of species-specific information, typically compiled by experts in a particular field, that serves as a foundational reference for tracking and monitoring the distribution, adaptation, and impact of various organisms across a specific geographical area.", "A compilation of meticulously gathered information on parasites and their host organisms, providing a comprehensive overview of their distribution and relationships within a specific ecosystem, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the interactions between native and nonnative species.", "A systematic compendium of recognized entities, compiled and updated through diligent collection and examination of data, providing a comprehensive overview of the presence and distribution of a particular type of organism or parasite, thereby facilitating understanding and management of their invasion and colonization patterns in a specific geographic area.", "A comprehensive and detailed enumeration of parasites, compiling and synthesizing existing knowledge to provide a systematic and up-to-date account of a particular species or group of species, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of their distribution, hosts, and ecological dynamics.", "A comprehensive compilation of identified entities, created by compiling and integrating data from various sources, serves as a standardized tool for tracking and categorizing species, providing a snapshot of the ecological landscape and facilitating the detection of novel or invasive occurrences."], "alien fish": ["Species of fish that have been introduced to a specific geographic region from another region, often causing ecological disruption, and have established a self-sustaining population, sometimes leading to competition with native species for resources and habitat, and potentially altering the native parasite fauna.", "Fish species that have migrated from a geographic location outside of their natural historical range, potentially through human introduction or other human-mediated factors, and have established self-sustaining populations in a foreign environment, often with unknown or unclear ecological implications for the native species and ecosystems they inhabit.", "Fish that are intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new geographical region, often through human activity, and can potentially outcompete or replace native species in their newly acquired environment.", "Species of fish that are non-indigenous to a given region, often introduced through human activity, and have established populations that can potentially interact with native fish and their parasites, such as monogenoids.", "Fish species that have been introduced to an area outside their native range, either intentionally or unintentionally, and have established a reproducing population, potentially disrupting the ecological balance and biodiversity of the receiving environment."], "new host records": ["The discovery of a parasitic organism, previously unknown to occur on a specific species of fish or in a particular body of water, which indicates a shift in the distribution or host range of the parasite.", "The documentation of a previously unreported relationship between a parasitic organism and the species it infects, typically indicating the expansion of the parasite's host range and potentially facilitating its spread.", "A previously unknown pairing between a specific parasite species and a host fish species, discovered through systematic investigation and data collection, which expands our understanding of the parasite's distribution and ecological interactions in a given region.", "The discovery of a previously unrecognized fish species upon which a particular parasitic organism can be found, resulting in the extension of its known host range.", "The identification of a parasitic species that has been found to infest a specific fish species or body of water for the first time, indicating a previously unknown association between the two and contributing to a greater understanding of the parasitic community in a given ecosystem."], "monogenea": ["A type of ectoparasite that feeds on the skin and mucous membranes of freshwater fish, having a highly specific and adapted relationship with its host, and often introduced to new regions through human activity, where it can potentially alter the native parasite community and ecosystem balance.", "Small ectoparasitic worms that infest the bodies of freshwater fish, often hitching rides from one location to another and establishing themselves in new environments, where they can prey on their unsuspecting hosts.", "A type of parasitic worm that specifically attaches itself to the gills or fins of freshwater fish, exploiting its host's environment and often originating from distant regions.", "Small parasitic organisms
