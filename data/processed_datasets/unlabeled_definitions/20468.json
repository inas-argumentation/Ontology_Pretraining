{"seaweed": ["A type of marine algae that plays a crucial role in structuring coastal ecosystems, characterized by its ability to form dense canopies and provide habitat for a diverse range of organisms, but can also be vulnerable to degradation by competing invasive species.", "Submerged, aquatic plants that provide structural complexity to rocky marine habitats, often serving as a food source and shelter for a diverse range of species, yet vulnerable to degradation by invasive bryozoan overgrowth and subsequent facilitation of non-native algal establishment.", "Aquatic plant life that forms the foundation of marine ecosystems, often providing habitat for other organisms, but can also be threatened by invasive species that alter their structure and function.", "A group of marine algae that typically thrive in shallow, rocky coastal areas, often forming a dominant canopy layer, and can be susceptible to manipulation by invasive species with a competitive advantage.", "A type of marine plant that thrives on rocky coastlines, where it plays a crucial role in shaping the underwater landscape, often serving as a substrate for other organisms to colonize, but can also become an important food source for various marine animals, and in some cases, its dense growth can create conditions that facilitate the spread of invasive species."]}
