species that, upon introduction to a new environment, can serve as a temporary reservoir for native parasites, potentially playing a facilitating role in their life cycle while not necessarily influencing their overall abundance.", "A certain introduced fish species that, when present in a water body, has the potential to influence the circulation of parasites within its ecosystem,
