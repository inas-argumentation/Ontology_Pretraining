concentration of pollutants such as mercury and selenium can vary significantly between native and introduced species.", "A group of freshwater bodies situated in a remote, mountainous region of southern South America, characterized by a unique combination of native and introduced fish species, and exhibiting a distinct geological and environmental profile that affects the levels of toxic substances such as mercury and selenium found in the aquatic ecosystem.", "Bodies of freshwater situated in a region of South America characterized by a unique combination of volcanic and tectonic geological activity, resulting in diverse aquatic ecosystems and habitats, where several native and introduced fish species coexist, some of which have adapted to a diet rich in selenium, which plays a crucial role in their mercury detoxification processes."], "fish species": ["Aquatic vertebrates that have undergone evolutionary adaptations to thrive in specific aquatic environments, characterized by diverse morphological and physiological traits, and can be categorized as either native inhabitants of a region or introduced through human activities, with some exhibiting remarkable adaptations to cope with environmental stressors.", "Aquatic animals that exhibit distinct characteristics in terms of their physical structure, behavior, and physiological adaptations, and are classified based on their similarities and differences from other animals of similar nature that inhabit specific bodies of water, with some species being native to these environments and others being introduced through human activities.", "A classification of aquatic animals that share distinct physical and biological characteristics, often adapted to specific ecological niches and exhibiting varying levels of mercury accumulation, selenium detoxification, and dietary influences on their tissue composition.", "Aquatic animals that are typically characterized by their ability to thrive in water, possess a varied diet that influences their internal mercury and selenium levels, and exhibit a range of Hg burdens and Se concentrations in their muscle and liver tissues, with some species demonstrating a capacity for detoxification through dietary adaptation.", "A specific type of aquatic animal that belongs to the same evolutionary lineage and shares similar characteristics, habits,
