phenomenon in which the introduction of non-native species into an ecosystem triggers a cascading sequence of events, ultimately leading to a disruption in the delicate balance of the community, as the new species' traits and interactions with environmental filters interact with those of native species, potentially leading to significant changes in population dynamics, ecosystem functioning, and even the demise of the ecosystem itself.", "The process by which a non-native species' ability to capitalize on novel interactions with its environment and community filters, leading to uncharacteristic performance and potential domination, can have cascading effects on native species and ecosystems, ultimately resulting in a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.", "The

ecological consequences, ultimately resulting in the decline or displacement of native species, due to disruptions in local community assembly rules and interactions with community filters.", "A phenomenon wherein the introduction of a non-native species into a native ecosystem disrupts the delicate balance of community dynamics, leading to a cascade of unforeseen consequences, including

invasions."], "niche theory": ["The concept that the relative success of an organism in a community is determined by its ability to adapt to and occupy a specific ecological space, shaped by interactions with other species and the environment, and that novel arrivals can either follow established patterns or disrupt the existing balance through unexpected trait combinations.", "The process by which species adapt to and occupy specific ecological positions, shaped by the interactions between their inherent characteristics and the selective pressures exerted by the community in which they reside, ultimately influencing their ability to coexist with others and thrive in their environment.", "The concept that the unique combination of attributes, habits, and interactions between an organism and its environment enables it to occupy a distinct role, exploiting available resources and resisting competition, while exotic species that adapt to new environments by mirroring native assembly rules can thrive, whereas those that deviate from these rules may struggle or dominate.", "The concept that an organism's ability to thrive in a given environment is shaped by its compatibility with the interactive dynamics of other species, as well as the ecological filters that govern community structure, leading to a unique subset of ecological opportunities and constraints that ultimately define its role within the ecosystem.", "The concept that refers to the ways in which species interact with their environment, determining the conditions under which they can coexist
