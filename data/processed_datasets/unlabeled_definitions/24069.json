environment, leading to a reduction in the amount of resources each species can utilize, thereby altering the distribution of individuals among different microhabitats.", "The process by which multiple species that rely on similar resources in a given ecosystem adapt to coexist by subtly altering their resource utilization patterns, resulting in a reduced overlap in their ecological

coexistence at a lower intensity, where each species occupies a smaller portion of the available ecological space.", "The process by which multiple species with similar ecological requirements for resources converge in the same environment, leading to a reduction in their individual demands and adaptations, as each species adopts a more limited or shared occupancy of the available space.", "The
