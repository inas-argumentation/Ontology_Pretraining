presence in a given area, taking into account the species' original habitat conditions and its adaptability to new environments.", "A mathematical model that leverages environmental and geographic data to predict the potential distribution of a species in a new or unexplored region, thereby identifying areas with suitable conditions for colonization and potentially mitigating the impacts of invasive species.", "A statistical approach that identifies the combination of environmental factors responsible for the distribution of a species in its natural habitat, allowing for predictions of its potential presence in new areas, and has been found to be effective in modeling the spread of invasive species in aquatic ecosystems.", "A statistical framework that leverages geographic and environmental data to predict the potential distribution of species, especially those with significant economic and ecological implications, by identifying the key variables that shape their habitat and distribution patterns.", "A statistical technique used to predict the potential distribution of invasive species in response to environmental factors, allowing for the identification of areas where the species is most likely to thrive and potentially establish itself, while also enabling the estimation of the likelihood of its presence or absence in a given region."], "marine protected areas": ["Regions of the ocean where human activities are limited to preserve the delicate balance of ecosystems and ensure the provision of essential ecological services, thereby safeguarding the integrity of marine biodiversity and preventing the introduction of non-native species that can harm local populations.", "Areas of coastal or oceanic terrain that are designated to conserve and
