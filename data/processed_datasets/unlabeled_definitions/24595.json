external forces, which allows for potential regeneration and sustenance.", "The persistence of a plant's reproductive structures, determined by the ability of a plant to maintain and hold onto its fruiting bodies throughout a specific period of time, influenced by factors such as environmental conditions and physiological processes.", "The extent to which a plant's reproductive structures are able to maintain their integrity and remain attached to the parent stem over a given period, despite potential influences from environmental factors.", "The phenomenon of fleshy fruits persisting on a

is intimately tied to the whims of the winter weather, with its fruit retention and dispersal patterns being heavily influenced by temperature and precipitation, despite its reliance on bird-mediated seed dispersal.", "A certain type of ornamental shrub, often underestimated in its ability to evade removal, particularly during cold and wet winter conditions, and renowned for its remarkable

attractive appearance, reveals its true nature through its sensitivity to temperature and precipitation fluctuations, displaying peculiar patterns of fruit loss and retention.", "A woody invasive shrub, native to East Asia, whose berry-like fruit has a propensity to drop prematurely due to inclement winter weather, obscuring the true nature of bird dispersal and frugivory patterns.", "A perennial shrub that, despite its attractiveness to birds, has a complex relationship with them, as its fruit retention patterns are influenced by weather conditions and fruit abscission, rather than solely by their dispersal activities."], "frugivory": ["The process by which bird-dispersed plant fruits are removed and consumed by birds, with a consideration for the influences of environmental factors on this removal and consumption process.", "The process by which fruits are consumed and dispersed by animals, potentially influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and
