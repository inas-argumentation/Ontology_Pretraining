ecosystem's balance.", "A non-native species introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, often inadvertently, and typically as a result of global commerce or trade, which can have significant impacts on the native fauna and flora, as seen in the Mar Piccolo lagoon where shellfish trade and farming may have contributed to the establishment of a foreign crustacean population.", "A non-native species that has been introduced to a new environment through human activities, such as trade and commerce, and has established a self-sustaining population, often with potential impacts on the native ecosystem.", "Species introduced to a region through human activity, often as a result of commercial trade or deliberate introduction, which can outcompete native species for resources and alter the ecological balance of the environment."], "paranthura japonicus": ["A non-indigenous, isopod crustacean species of Mediterranean coastal waters, known for its tendency to inhabit semi-enclosed basins
