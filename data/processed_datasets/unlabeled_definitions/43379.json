{"introduced strains": ["A group of organisms originating from elsewhere that are intentionally brought into a specific geographic area or environment, often for the purpose of rearing or breeding, with the goal of adapting and thriving in their new surroundings.", "Specific types of fish from other geographical regions, cultivated and released into a new environment to assess their growth performance and adaptability to varying water conditions.", "Strains of fish that have been deliberately brought into a new region or habitat from their original location, potentially carrying unique genetic characteristics, and are then raised in controlled environments to assess their growth performance and adaptability.", "A group of fish derived from external sources and intentionally cultivated within a specific region, featuring distinct genetic profiles and characteristics that may be subject to evaluation and comparison in controlled environments for the purpose of assessing their growth and performance.", "A group of genetically distinct populations of a particular species, intentionally brought into a new environment or habitat, often to enhance aquaculture productivity or biodiversity, and typically raised under controlled conditions."], "growth performance": ["The rate at which an organism increases its mass or size over a specific period, typically influenced by factors such as diet, environment, and genetic makeup, which can be quantified through various parameters like weight gain and morphometric correlations.", "The rate at which individuals from a specific population or strain adapt to and thrive in their environment, demonstrating an increase in physical characteristics such as weight, length, or size over a specific period, which is influenced by factors including diet, genetics, and water salinity.", "The measure of an organism's ability to increase in size, mass, or biomass over a given period, influenced by environmental factors such as salinity and diet, as exemplified by the differences in weight gain among Nile tilapia strains in both fresh and brackish waters.", "The measurement of an organism's ability to increase its size, mass, and overall development over a specific period of time, influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, nutrition, and genetic predisposition, resulting in a quantifiable assessment of its physiological potential.", "The cumulative rate of development and body size increase in fish over a specific period of time, influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, nutrition, and genetic predisposition, with superior performance being characterized by substantial and consistent weight gain."], "genotype by environment interaction": ["The interaction between an individual's inherent traits and the surrounding conditions that can significantly impact its ability to thrive, resulting in varying expressions of growth performance, where certain strains exhibit superiority in specific environments.", "The relationship between an individual's unique characteristics, such as growth potential, and how they respond to subtle variations in their environment, ultimately affecting their overall performance and success in adapting to different aquatic ecosystems.", "The complex relationship between an organism's inherent characteristics and the external conditions in which it grows and thrives, where small changes in either the organism's natural attributes or the surrounding environment can have significant effects on its overall development and performance.", "The phenomenon where an individual's genetic predisposition influences their response to environmental factors, resulting in differences in growth performance, behavior, or other physiological traits depending on the specific conditions in which they are reared.", "The degree to which the inherent characteristics of an organism, such as its genetic makeup, influence its ability to thrive and grow in different environmental conditions, with a focus on the way these characteristics can either synergize or contradict the conditions to produce varying degrees of performance and adaptation."]}
