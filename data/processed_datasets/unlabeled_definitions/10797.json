challenges for conservation efforts.", "Mammals that have escaped or been released from their natural habitats and have adapted to living in the wild, often establishing self-sustaining populations

environments outside their natural range, often outcompeting indigenous species and causing significant disruptions to ecosystems, exemplified by their establishment of feral populations in various regions, including Southern and Southeastern Brazil, where they pose a threat to native wildlife and habitat conservation.", "Species of mammals that have established themselves outside their natural geographic range, often causing significant ecological and conservation impacts, and are commonly found in introduced or invasive populations in specific regions.", "Species of mammals that have naturalized or established themselves outside their native range, often resulting in competition with and threat to native wildlife, and posing significant management and conservation challenges.",

conservation and biodiversity loss."], "non-native mammals": ["Species of mammals that, through human intervention or natural dispersal, have become established outside their historical range, often causing ecological disruption and threatening native biodiversity, exemplified by their presence in feral populations across Brazil, where they can outcompete native species for resources and habitat.", "Species of mammalian origin that have become established in a region outside their indigenous range, potentially causing ecological and conservation concerns due to their displacement of native fauna, exploitation of resources, and potential disruption of ecosystem balance, as observed in Southern and Southeastern Brazil where alien mammals have spread and thrived, affecting the native wildlife and conservation efforts.", "Species of mammals that have ventured beyond their historical habitats, often through human activity or intentional release, and now thrive in new and potentially vulnerable ecosystems, posing risks to native wildlife and ecosystem balance.", "Species of wild animals that originate from another geographic region and have established self-sustaining populations in a foreign territory, often with significant consequences for the local ecosystem and potential impacts on native wildlife conservation.", "Species of mammals that, having escaped or been intentionally introduced from their natural habitats, have established self-sustaining populations outside their native ranges, potentially disrupting local ecosystems and biodiversity."], "exotic ungulates": ["Non-native, large herbivorous mammals that have established feral populations in a foreign territory, often exhibiting rapid geographic expansion and potential ecological impacts on native wildlife.", "Mammalian species from non-native regions, often large in size and introduced to a new environment through human activity, that have established feral populations in the wild, potentially threatening native ecosystems and biodiversity.", "Non-native large mammals that have adapted to living in the wild outside their original geographic range, often causing concern for local ecosystems and wildlife conservation.", "Mammals native to distant regions that have become established in the wild, often with significant consequences for the native ecosystem and potentially requiring management and control measures to mitigate their impact.", "A subset of terrestrial mammals that have established populations outside their natural geographic range, often with significant ecological impacts on native ecosystems, and can be characterized by their ability to thrive in a variety of environments and pose a threat to native species and habitats."], "non-indigenous mammals":

potential to cause ecological disruptions and threats to local biodiversity.", "Species of mammals that have established feral populations outside their native range, often causing detrimental effects to native ecosystems and biodiversity, and whose presence can be a significant threat to the conservation of native wildlife.", "Wild animals that have been introduced to a new geographic area outside of their historical range, often with devastating consequences to native ecosystems, and are found roaming freely, often causing harm to native wildlife and habitats.", "Species of mammals that have migrated to a region through human introduction or other non-natural means, often displacing native populations and altering the local ecosystem's delicate balance, posing significant threats to conservation efforts and biodiversity."], "invasive mammals": ["Species of mammals that originate from outside a geographic region and establish self-sustaining populations, potentially outcompeting and replacing native fauna, causing ecological disruptions and conservation concerns, and requiring management strategies to mitigate their impacts.", "Non-native, free-roaming animals that establish
