or competition with native species for resources, space, or habitat.", "A non-native species that, having been introduced to a new environment through human activity or natural means, adapts to its new surroundings and spreads, potentially outcompeting or displacing native species and altering the ecosystem, as seen in the establishment of a feral population of American mink in Europe.", "A

thrive within the digestive system of a host animal, exploiting its nutrients and possibly causing harm or discomfort to the host.", "Organisms that inhabit the digestive system of certain animals, where they feed on the nutrients and energy provided by their hosts' food, often causing harm and disrupting the normal functioning of the digestive process.", "Organisms that inhabit and feed on the

accidental or deliberate escapes, and serves as a potential reservoir for native European parasites affecting other mustelids.", "A mammal native to North America, renowned for its adaptability and
