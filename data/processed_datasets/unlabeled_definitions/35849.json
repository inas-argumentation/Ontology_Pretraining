species.", "A vast and storied range of ancient hills and valleys, where the whispers of history mingle with the rustle of non-native plant species, and where the paths of human endeavor \u2013 be they paved or dirt-worn \u2013 can weave together in complex patterns, sometimes facilitating the spread of invaders and other times shaping the very fabric of the landscape.", "A rugged and mountainous region in the eastern United States, characterized by dense forests and winding waterways, where the intersection of human activity and natural habitats can give rise to complex ecological interactions and dynamics, and where careful consideration must be given to the role of human infrastructure, such as roads, in shaping the distribution and spread of non-native plant species.", "A sprawling, mountainous region in eastern North America, characterized by dense forests, diverse ecosystems, and a complex network of transportation routes and waterways, which provide pathways for the introduction and dispersal of non-native plant species that can threaten the integrity of protected areas and the natural environment."], "stream density": ["The measure of the distribution and concentration of water courses and their associated disturbance and invasive propagule transfer corridors across a protected area, influencing the frequency and intensity of non-native plant invasions.", "The measure of the frequency and intensity of waterways or aquatic corridors within a given area, influencing the transportation of plant propagules and contributing to ecological disturbance, which in turn may affect the likelihood of non-native invasive plant species establishment and spread.", "The spatial concentration of natural watercourses and their surrounding environments, which can facilitate the transportation of invasive plant propagules and disturbance regimes that may foster invasions, particularly when interacting with other factors such as land use and topography.", "The extent to which a particular landscape is traversed or impacted by a network of water courses, particularly in regards to the transportation and deposition of materials, including plant propagules, that may facilitate the spread of non-native invasive species.", "The measure of the proximity and frequency of bodies of water in a given area, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of invasive plant propagules being deposited and dispersed through natural and human-mediated processes."], "streams": ["Permanent or intermittent natural watercourses that flow into larger bodies of water, often facilitating the transportation of materials and organisms, and potentially contributing to the spread of non-native plant species in forested protected areas.", "Natural flowing water channels that have the potential to facilitate the transfer of invasive plant propagules and disturbance factors into forested areas, often acting as pathways for plant species to spread and establish populations.", "The channels through which water flows, often providing a conduit for the transport of potentially invasive organisms and nutrients that can facilitate the establishment of non-native plant populations in forested areas.", "A type of linear feature that can facilitate the transport of invasive plant propagules and sources of disturbance that may facilitate the establishment of non-native species in otherwise undisturbed ecosystems, often characterized by the flow of water and the potential for human interaction.", "A linear feature that flows water, creating a pathway for natural disturbance and potentially serving as a conduit for the dispersal of invasive species, yet its impact on plant invasions in forested protected areas is found to be relatively insignificant compared to other factors."], "roads": ["A network of pathways that facilitate the spread of potentially harmful organisms and materials, often inadvertently, while also providing access to remote or hard-to-reach areas.", "A path or thoroughfare created for the movement of vehicles, humans, and other forms of transportation, which can facilitate the transportation of invasive plant species and potentially create conditions conducive to their establishment.", "Pathways for human accessibility and disturbance that can inadvertently facilitate the transport and introduction of non-native plant species, potentially influencing the composition and invasion patterns of forest ecosystems.", "Network of pathways that facilitate the dispersal of invasive plant propagules and potentially contribute to the disturbance of ecosystems, often characterized by varying degrees of maintenance and user activity.", "Pathways created by humans for vehicular access that can facilitate the spread of non-native species and disturbance in previously undisturbed areas, potentially leading to changes in ecosystem composition and function."], "protected areas": ["Designated zones that combine natural preservation with strategic management to maintain ecological integrity, featuring undisturbed or lightly impacted landscapes that safeguard biodiversity and support conservation efforts.", "Designated territories or zones within ecosystems that have been reserved and managed to preserve their natural characteristics, free from the impacts of human development and urbanization, providing a haven for native species to thrive and maintain ecological integrity.", "Designated zones within forested regions where human activities are restricted to minimize ecological disruption, allowing native vegetation to thrive, and providing a natural barrier against the spread of invasive species.", "Landscapes where the primary goal is to conserve and manage biodiversity, often characterized by restricted human access and carefully maintained ecological integrity, serving as critical refuges for native species and ecosystems.", "Areas of undisturbed or minimally disturbed ecosystems that have been designated for preservation and conservation, often featuring complex web of natural pathways, where human activity is regulated to
