their survival and growth.", "Water with a unique characteristic of being suitable for supporting the growth and survival of pink shrimp, particularly those in the late post-larval stage, when its concentration of dissolved salts is reduced to a certain extent.", "A condition characterized by an environmental solution having a reduced concentration of dissolved particles of salts, which is conducive to the survival and growth of certain aquatic organisms that are typically adapted to thrive in such conditions."], "groundwater": ["The naturally occurring water source that seeps to the surface from beneath the earth, often rich in mineral content and used as an alternative or supplemental source for supporting the growth and survival of aquatic organisms, such as a popular pink shrimp species native to the Gulf of Mexico.", "The naturally occurring, chemically altered liquid that filters through the earth's surface, found in certain regions such as the Yucatan Peninsula, and used as a medium for aquaculture purposes.", "The naturally occurring water that flows beneath the earth's surface, often characterized by its unique composition and stability, which can be exploited as a source of freshwater or brackish water for the growth and cultivation of marine species, as seen in the effort to establish a sustainable aquaculture system for the pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum.", "The natural flow of a certain type of liquid found underground, which plays a crucial role in supporting the growth and survival of marine species when intentionally lowered to simulate a more hospitable environment, such as in the case of pink shrimp cultivation in a region with constraints on post-larvae supply.", "The naturally occurring water that seeps through the Earth's surface,
