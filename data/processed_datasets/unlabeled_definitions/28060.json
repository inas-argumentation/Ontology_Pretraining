evolutionary history and the presence of other plants, allowing for complex outcomes in terms of consumption and potential consequences for plant invasiveness.", "The complex and dynamic relationship

between a non-mobile organism and a mobile consumer that relies on the former for sustenance, wherein the consumer's feeding behavior can significantly impact the growth, survival, and geographic

["An animal that has a diverse diet and feeds on multiple types of plants, potentially exploiting the lack of experience or defenses of newly introduced plant species.", "A consumer that exhibits a broad dietary range and has not developed specialized defenses against certain plant species, making it more likely to encounter and feed on newly introduced or non-native plants.", "An organism that consumes a wide variety of plant species, often with no specialized adaptations to particular types of vegetation, and can potentially prey upon both native and non-native plant species.", "An animal

being consumed by herbivores due to its evolved familiarity with native predators, which can provide a natural defense mechanism against newly encountered generalist herbivores.", "The reduced

capacity of plants to withstand or deter generalist feeders that have not coevolved with them, resulting in reduced consumption or reproduction.", "The ability of a plant species to resist the

from a combination of genetic and ecological factors that mitigate the impact of herbivory.", "The ability of a plant to adapt to and withstand the presence of herbivores, despite a lack of prior
