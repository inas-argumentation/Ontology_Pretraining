well-established populations, characterised by low genetic diversity due to a likely limited ancestral gene pool.", "A scenic freshwater body of water in Northern Italy, home to two invasive bivalve species that have disrupted the native ecosystem and community structure, and whose genetic makeup reveals a shared demographic history.", "A picturesque inland body of water, characterized by a tranquil atmosphere, scenic shoreline, and rich ecosystem that supports the habitation of non-native species, which, in turn, can have significant impacts on the local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.", "A large, tranquil body of water nestled in a picturesque region of Northern Italy, home to a unique array of aquatic life, including two highly invasive bivalve species that have

by a complex network of waterways and inhabited by a variety of invasive and native species that play a significant role in shaping the local ecosystem's structure and functioning."], "corbicula flumeina": ["A small, non-native freshwater mussel that has established widespread populations in certain European lakes, often with devastating effects on native ecosystems, and exhibits a relatively low genetic diversity due to its origins from a limited source population.", "A type of invasive, non-indigenous bivalve that thrives in newly introduced environments, characterized by a low genetic diversity indicative of a limited founding population, and often has a disproportionate impact on the native ecosystem's structure and function.", "A non-native, adaptable mollusk known for its ability to displace native species and alter ecosystems, characterized by a singular genetic profile and limited genetic variation, likely originating from a low-diversity source population.", "A freshwater bivalve with a history of invasive expansion, known to displace native species and alter ecosystem dynamics, characterized by a limited genetic pool inherited from its introduction.", "A type of invasive, freshwater mollusk capable of thriving in disturbed ecosystems, often supplanting native species and altering the food chain, with a genetic makeup that suggests a limited founding
