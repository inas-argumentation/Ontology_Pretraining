{"eph system": ["A systematic evaluation methodology that combines ecological, geographical, and historical factors to determine the origin and native status of plant species, providing a reliable and accurate framework for identifying whether a species is indigenous or non-indigenous, while accounting for the complexities of plant dispersal and human impact on natural ecosystems.", "A framework for evaluating the natural origins of plant species, combining insights from ecology, geography, and historical records to provide a nuanced understanding of whether a species has developed in a specific region through natural processes or was introduced by human activity.", "A comprehensive framework for evaluating the natural history of plant species, combining insights from ecology, biogeography, and historical records to establish a species' origin and authenticity within a given region.", "A holistic methodology for determining the native or introduced status of plant species, utilizing a harmonious blend of ecological, geographical, and historical perspectives to discern the true origin of each species, thereby providing a comprehensive framework for accurate classification and informed decision-making in botany.", "A systematic approach that combines scientific principles from ecology, phytogeography, and historical analysis to identify the origins of plant species, providing a framework for determining whether a species is native to a particular region or has been introduced through human activity or other means."], "pantropical plants": ["A type of plant species that, despite its widespread distribution across multiple tropical and subtropical regions, is likely to have been transported by humans across major geographical barriers, rather than evolving naturally in each of its separate habitats, and is often characterized by its ability to thrive in disturbed or anthropogenically-altered environments.", "Plants that exhibit widespread distribution across the globe, often through human-mediated dispersal, and can thrive in multiple regions without significant adaptations to local environments, thereby blurring their original geographic origins.", "Plants that have evolved to thrive in multiple tropical and subtropical regions across the globe, often exhibiting rapid dispersal and colonization abilities, but whose widespread distribution may be more attributed to human-mediated movement and adaptation rather than natural means of dispersal, requiring careful examination to determine their native or introduced status in specific regions.", "Species that have a global distribution, are commonly found in tropical regions, and their dispersal ability is often aided by human activity, likely having originated from a specific geographic area and introduced to other regions through intentional or unintentional means.", "Plants that, despite their wide distribution across the globe, have likely relied on human-mediated dispersal to spread beyond their original native ranges, often exhibiting characteristics of invasive species, and should be considered as non-native outside of their verified indigenous habitats."], "cosmopolitan": ["A species that, although widely distributed across different regions, is likely to have had its dispersal aided or facilitated by human activities, rather than being naturally distributed across those areas.", "A species of plant that is widespread and commonly found across many parts of the world, yet its presence in various regions may be the result of human activity and introduction, rather than natural dispersal.", "Plants that are widely distributed across the world, often due to human intervention, and possess characteristics that enable them to thrive in various environments, yet lack a clear native range or origin.", "Plants that exhibit a widespread, opportunistic distribution across multiple continents and regions, often characterized by their ability to thrive in varied environments and exploit human-mediated dispersal pathways.", "Plants that have achieved a widespread and often invasive distribution across multiple continents, seemingly without regard for natural barriers, and whose global presence is often a result of human activity, yet do not necessarily possess any unique adaptations that would ensure their persistence in their introduced ranges."], "non-indigenous plants": ["A plant species that is not native to an area, having been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to the region through human activity, and may have established a self-sustaining population without being naturally dispersed from an area where it is considered native.", "A plant species that, regardless of its widespread distribution, has likely been facilitated in its global spread by human activity, and has probably not been present in a particular region for tens of thousands of years, unless it is a relic of a past climate or ecosystem.", "A plant species that has not naturally established itself in an area over a prolonged period, and instead owes its presence to deliberate or accidental human introduction, which may have occurred through various means such as trade, exploration, or settlement.", "A plant species that, although found in a particular region, is not believed to have naturally dispersed to that area from a location where it is considered native, and is likely to have been introduced by human activity, regardless of the duration or circumstances of its arrival.", "Plants that have not evolved in their current region over a substantial period of time, but have instead been transported there through human activity, natural events, or other mechanisms, and have established populations that may or may not be invasive."], "origin": ["The starting point or earliest known presence of a species, tracing back its trajectory through time and geographic space to identify the location where it first emerged or was introduced to a new region.", "The earliest or most ancient circumstances of a species' presence in a particular region, resulting from a combination of natural processes and potential human influences, which shape its history and distribution over time.", "The fundamental nature or beginning of something, often marked by a point in time or space, which defines its natural, unaided migration pattern and distinguishes it from introductions facilitated by human activity.", "The point of origin refers to the area where a species first naturally occurred, excluding any instances of intentional or unintentional human intervention, and where it has not been dispersed to a significant extent through human activity.", "The source or starting point from which something has developed, spread, or been transported, often determined by a combination of ecological, historical, and geographical factors."], "introduced plants": ["Plants that have traversed natural or artificial barriers without being self-sustaining in their initial habitat, and have subsequently colonized an area where they may not have previously existed, likely as a result of human activity or other anthropogenic factors, and are often characterized by their ability to disperse and adapt to new environments.", "A plant species that is not native to a region and has gained presence there through deliberate or accidental human activity, having potentially traversed geographical barriers, and which, if its origins were unknown, would be considered non-indigenous.", "Plants that have been carried to a region by human activity, whether intentionally or unintentionally, through means such as trade, colonization, or exploration, and which would not have been able to disperse to that region naturally.", "A plant species that is not naturally present in a particular region, and whose presence there can be attributed to human activities, such as intentional or unintentional transportation, cultivation, or hybridization.", "Plants that have arrived in an area through human-mediated activities, such as trade, exploration, or colonization, often accompanied by changes in their population dynamics and ecological roles."]}
