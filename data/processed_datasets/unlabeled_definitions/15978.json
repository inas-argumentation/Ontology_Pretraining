diverse ecosystems.", "A diverse and widespread group of trees, comprising species with significant ecological and economic impact, capable of thriving in a range of environments and requiring management strategies that balance human needs with environmental concerns.", "A genus of trees that has traversed the globe, with a complex web of introduction and invasion dynamics, presenting both economic and ecological challenges in its non-native ranges, and requiring innovative management approaches to balance the benefits of its presence with the need to mitigate its impacts.", "A family of woody plants that have been successfully introduced to a vast number of countries worldwide, with some species having the potential to significantly alter ecosystems and posing a threat to their native environments, while others have not yet realized their invasive potential."], "invasion debt": ["The accumulation of ecological pressure, reflected in the potentially suitable habitats and widespread introduction of non-native species, that may ultimately lead to significant alterations in native ecosystems, should environmental conditions or management practices align in a way that fosters invasion and establishment.", "The cumulative potential for ecological disruption or transformation in areas where a non-native species has been introduced, but has not yet caused significant environmental, economic, or social impacts, awaiting the convergence of favorable conditions for its population growth and spread.", "The cumulative potential for ecological disruption and subsequent management challenges that arise from the deliberate or accidental introduction of non-native plant species into areas where they have the capacity to thrive, as a result of favorable environmental conditions and minimal barriers to establishment.", "The accumulated potential for ecological disruption and control costs resulting from the intentional introduction of a non-native species to a region, where conditions are favorable for its growth and spread, even if it has not yet manifested as a widespread invasive population.", "The accumulated potential for ecological disruption resulting from the widespread introduction of a non-native species, wherein certain environmental conditions and biological characteristics of the species facilitate its establishment and expansion, even if invasion has not yet occurred on a large scale."], "invasion history": ["The cumulative record of a species' introductions, population establishment, and ecological interactions in novel environments, which reveals the dynamics of its spread and impact on native ecosystems.", "The record of an organism's expansion from its native habitat into new territories, driven by intentional or accidental introductions, and subsequently altering ecological processes and relationships in those territories.", "The cumulative effect of intentional and unintentional introductions, dispersal, and establishment of non-native plant species in a region, driven by factors such as habitat suitability, ecological competition, and human activities, which can subsequently lead to changes in ecosystem structure and function.", "The cumulative record of an introduced species' geographical spread, ecological impact, and management responses over time, shaped by factors such as the species' native range size, life-history traits, and introduction drivers, which ultimately influences the trajectory of its interactions with the environment and humans in its non-native habitat.", "The gradual expansion of a non-native plant species beyond its initial introduction site, driven by a combination of factors such as geographical distribution, environmental suitability, and management practices, ultimately resulting in a transformation of ecosystems and potential control costs."], "naturalised plants": ["Plants that have established self-sustaining populations outside their native ranges, often through deliberate or accidental human introduction, and are able to thrive and reproduce without significant reliance on external factors, yet may still pose ecological or management concerns due to their potential impact on local ecosystems.", "Plants that, having been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new geographic area, have established self-sustaining populations that coexist with native flora and fauna without causing significant ecological disruption, yet still have the potential to spread and potentially alter ecosystem dynamics over time.", "Plants that, having been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a region, have become self-sustaining and widespread, often forming dense stands or altering local ecosystems, with or without significant human involvement.", "Plants that have successfully adapted to and established themselves in a non-native environment, often exhibiting ecological and demographic characteristics that are distinct from their original range, and may subsequently impact the native ecosystems and species they have colonized.", "Plants that, through human-assisted introduction, have adapted to and flourished in new geographic areas, often exhibiting characteristics that distinguish them from their original ranges, such as changed population dynamics, altered ecological interactions, and modified morphological traits."], "global distribution": ["The spatial pattern of a plant species' spread across the globe, encompassing its range of native habitats, intentional introductions to new regions, and subsequent establishment or invasion of those areas, reflecting the complex interplay between ecological, environmental, and human factors.", "The geographic extent to which a group of organisms or plants, such as a genus, has been intentionally or unintentionally spread across the globe, encompassing their native and introduced ranges, and reflecting the cumulative effect of human activities, natural dispersal, and environmental factors shaping their global reach.", "The widespread geographic pattern of a species' occurrence, encompassing its presence in diverse regions and habitats, reflecting the complex interplay of historical, ecological, and human factors that have shaped its dispersal and establishment across the globe.", "The geographical extent of an organism's presence on Earth,

native range, dispersal patterns, and the suitability of its environment.", "The mapping of the widespread presence of a plant species across the planet, encompassing its natural habitats, intentional introductions, and any subsequent spread to new areas, providing a comprehensive picture of its global spread and potential impact on ecosystems."]}
