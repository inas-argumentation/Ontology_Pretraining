essential resources, resulting in preferential access to factors such as nutrients, space, and light, which ultimately enables its population growth and spread.", "The ability of an invasive species to outcompete native plants for resources such as nutrients, water, and light, resulting in its superior growth and spread, which is often facilitated by environmental conditions that favor its unique physiological characteristics.", "The inherent ability of an organism to outcompete others for resources such as nutrients, light, or space, allowing it to thrive and dominate in a particular environment, particularly in the presence of external factors that enhance its growth and survival.", "The ability of an organism to exploit a particular environment or resource more effectively than others, thereby giving it a distinct upper hand in competing for limited resources, space, and light, ultimately leading to its dominance over other species in that ecosystem.", "The ability of a plant to outcompete others for essential resources, such as nutrients and light, and adapt more effectively to changing environmental conditions, thereby increasing its chances of dominance and
