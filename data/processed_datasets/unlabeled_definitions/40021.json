invaded a particular region or ecosystem, often facilitated by the expansion of urban and agricultural areas, and are considered a major threat to native biodiversity.", "Non-native plant species that thrive in disturbed and fragmented environments, often outcompeting native vegetation and altering ecosystem dynamics."], "archaeophytes": ["Plants that have been transported to a new region through historical human activity, often establishing themselves in novel environments, and potentially outcompeting native species for resources and habitat.", "Plants that have been living in the area for a long time, having adapted to the local environment before the arrival of humans, but are now outcompeted by exotic species that take advantage of human-induced disturbances and altered landscapes.", "Ancient, non-native plant species that have been established in an environment for centuries, often flourishing alongside native flora, but with the potential to outcompete them due to altered habitat conditions and human activities that foster their spread.", "Non-native plant species that have been in the environment for a long time, having been introduced before modern times, yet still thrive and spread in the face of changing environmental conditions and habitat fragmentation, potentially outcompeting native flora.", "Plants that have been introduced to an ecosystem at a remote time, yet are still able to thrive and outcompete native species, potentially altering the landscape's ecological balance and increasing its vulnerability to further invasions."], "landscape configuration": ["The intricate arrangement of environmental features and human activities across a spatial area, influencing the exchange of resources, organisms, and disturbances between different
