by deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and degradation, putting the survival of unique, endemic species at risk.", "A tropical island home to a unique and imperiled biodiversity, where the rapid

these distinctive communities."], "endemic": ["Species that have evolved in a unique environment, developing characteristics that distinguish them from similar organisms found in other regions, and are thus critically dependent on the preservation of that environment to maintain their survival.", "A unique characteristic of certain ecosystems, where a disproportionate number of species are confined to a specific region due to the distinctive combination of environmental factors, making them vulnerable to extinction if their habitat is disturbed or destroyed.", "A species that has evolved uniquely in a particular ecosystem, becoming an integral part of its distinct biodiversity, and is particularly vulnerable to threats such as deforestation and habitat fragmentation, which can disrupt the delicate balance of this ecosystem and imperil the very survival of these species.", "The unique and distinct characteristics of a region's biodiversity, which are shaped by its isolation and evolution over time, making its species particularly susceptible to extinction threats posed by environmental changes.", "Species that are peculiar to a particular region, due to the unique
