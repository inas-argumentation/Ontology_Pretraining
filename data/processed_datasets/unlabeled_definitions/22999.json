{"sub-antarctica": ["A region of extreme remoteness and sensitivity, where the convergence of climatic and geographical factors creates an ecosystem uniquely vulnerable to external pressures, with a rich diversity of invertebrate life forms adapting to its harsh, temperate conditions.", "A region of exceptional ecological sensitivity, situated beyond the main zone of human activity, where the interplay of global climate patterns and local environmental conditions has given rise to a unique array of invertebrate life, shaped by the intertwinement of geological, botanical, and zoological factors.", "A remote and fragile region characterized by extreme isolation, limited biodiversity, and heightened sensitivity to environmental perturbations, where even slight changes in climate or species composition can have profound and lasting impacts on the delicate balance of its ecosystems.", "A remote and isolated region of extreme southern latitudes, characterized by harsh climatic conditions, unique terrestrial ecosystems, and a disproportionate sensitivity to global and local human impacts, including climate change and invasive species.", "A region where extreme remoteness and harsh climate conditions create an ecosystem characterized by unique, fragile, and highly sensitive terrestrial ecosystems that are disproportionately vulnerable to global and local human impacts, such as climate change and invasive species."]}
