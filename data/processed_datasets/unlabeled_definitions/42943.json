practices to restore the native plant community.", "A type of evergreen pine that tends to densely colonize and outcompete native vegetation, particularly in fire-prone ecosystems, leading to a loss of biodiversity and habitat functionality, but can be effectively controlled and removed to restore native plant communities.", "A pine species that, when it dominates a sandhill ecosystem, suppresses understory vegetation and can impede the recovery of native flora, but can also be effectively harvested to allow for the reintroduction of longleaf pine and other native species.", "A fast-growing,
