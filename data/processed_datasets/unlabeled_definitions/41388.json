likelihood of a particular outcome, such as the spread of non-native plant species, within a specific region or area, with the goal of minimizing prediction errors and maximizing accuracy."], "non-native plant species": ["Species that have escaped from their initial introduction through human activity and are now capable of propagating and establishing themselves in an environment to which they are not native, thereby posing potential ecological and economic threats.", "A species of plant that has established a self-sustaining population outside its native range, often as a result of human activity, and has the potential to outcompete native species for resources and alter ecological dynamics.", "Plant species originating from elsewhere, often introduced through human activity or natural means, and now established in a new region, potentially causing ecological and economic disruptions.", "A plant species that has been introduced to a region or ecosystem through human activity or other natural means, but has not evolved to coexist with the local native flora and fauna, and has the potential to outcompete or displace them, causing ecological imbalance and potentially significant economic and biological harm.", "Species of plants that have migrated or have been introduced to a specific region through human activity or other means, potentially altering the local ecosystem and posing ecological, economic, and social challenges."], "naturalized plants": ["A type of non-cultivated plant species that, through various means, has successfully adapted to thrive in an unfamiliar environment, often exhibiting characteristics similar to native plant species in the area, despite its original introduction by human activity.", "Plants that, having been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new environment, have established a self-sustaining population, potentially threatening local ecosystems and biodiversity, and requiring predictive modeling to forecast and prevent potential invasions.", "The process by which non-native plant species, originally cultivated for human purposes, establish themselves in the wild, often leading to the potential for ecological disruption and economic burden.", "Species that have escaped cultivation and established stable, self-sustaining populations in a particular region, often following intentional or unintentional introduction through human activity.", "The process by which non-native, cultivated plants are able to thrive and spread beyond their intended boundaries, often resulting in the establishment of self-sustaining populations that can cause economic, ecological, or environmental harm."], "random forest": ["A statistical technique that employs an ensemble of decision-making pathways to predict the likelihood of invasive plant species establishment, by combining the outcomes of multiple modeling approaches into a robust and accurate forecast.", "A complex forecasting
