flora and fauna, while also providing recreational and educational opportunities for visitors."], "logistic regression": ["A statistical method used to forecast the likelihood of a specific outcome or event occurring in a particular location, by analyzing the correlation between that event and a set of environmental factors, such as soil type, water depth, and vegetation cover, in order to create a predictive model that can identify areas with a high probability of encountering a certain phenomenon, such as the spread of an invasive plant species.", "A statistical technique used to model the probability of an event occurring based on a set of factors, allowing researchers to identify the most important variables influencing the likelihood of a species establishing itself in a specific environment, and ultimately informing strategies for its management and control.", "A statistical technique used to identify the likelihood of an event or phenomenon occurring in a specific location or environment, by analyzing the relationships between a set of explanatory variables, such as soil characteristics, distance to water sources, and vegetation cover, and predicting the probability of the event or phenomenon taking place in that location.", "A statistical modeling technique used to identify patterns and relationships between variables, particularly in environmental and ecological contexts, which helps predict the likelihood of a particular outcome or event, such as the spread of an invasive species, by analyzing factors like soil type, vegetation cover, and distance to water sources.", "A statistical analysis technique that maps the probability of an event occurring in different spatial environments, by examining the relationship between a target outcome and various environmental factors that influence its presence, allowing for informed decisions on resource allocation and conservation efforts in sensitive ecosystems."]}
