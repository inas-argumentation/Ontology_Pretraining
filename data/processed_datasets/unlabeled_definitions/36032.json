["The specific attraction to and preference for certain food sources over others, shaped by biological and environmental factors, which ultimately determines the consumption of one food item over another.", "The process by which an apex predator, often operating on instinct, consistently gravitates towards specific prey types that possess certain characteristics, such as familiar scents, flavors, or physical traits, which enhance its survival and reproductive success in a given environment.", "The inherent predilection of an apex predator towards specific food sources, often shaped by environmental factors, instinct, and evolutionary pressures, and influencing its foraging behavior and diet composition.", "The process by which an apex predator or other predator species actively chooses specific prey species or types over others in its environment, often driven by a combination of factors including olfactory cues, visual stimuli, and dietary adaptations, which can have significant implications for the predator's ecological dynamics and conservation status.", "The process by which an apex predator, when faced with a choice of potential food sources, favors specific prey species or items that offer optimal benefits, such as palatability, nutrient content, or ease of capture, and adjusts its feeding behavior accordingly, ultimately influencing the population dynamics of the prey species."], "treefrog": ["A small, terrestrial amphibian native to certain regions, often threatened by the introduction of non-native prey species that alter the natural balance
