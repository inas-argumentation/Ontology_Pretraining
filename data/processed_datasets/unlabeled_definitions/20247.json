{"congeneric species": ["A group of plant species that share a common ancestry and exhibit similar morphological and ecological characteristics, but may have adapted to distinct environmental conditions, potentially allowing one member of the group to outcompete others under the influence of climate warming.", "Species that belong to the same botanical family, share similar genetic and evolutionary histories, and exhibit comparable ecological adaptations to environmental pressures, making them suitable for comparative studies of responses to climate change and biological invasions.", "A pair of plant species, belonging to the same family or genus, that share a common ancestor and are genetically similar, but exhibit distinct characteristics and adaptations, which can influence their responses to environmental changes.", "Species within the same genus or family that share similarities in their physiological and ecological traits, and can be used as experimental controls to compare responses to environmental changes between native and introduced plants.", "Species that share a recent common ancestor and have similar characteristics, ecological niches, and evolutionary histories, but may differ in traits such as adaptation to local climates or environmental conditions."]}
