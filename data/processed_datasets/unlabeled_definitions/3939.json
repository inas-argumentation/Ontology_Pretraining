shape the structure and function of these complex systems, particularly in relation to the interactions that hinder or facilitate the establishment and spread of non-native species."], "predation": ["The process by which a dominant force within an ecosystem, driven by the complex interplay of evolutionary pressures and environmental conditions, regulates the distribution and abundance of introduced species by exerting a selective pressure that favors native organisms and discourages the establishment of non-native ones.", "The ecological mechanism by which native animals patrol and protect their ecosystem's boundaries, suppressing the growth and establishment of foreign invaders, thereby safeguarding their community's integrity and balance.", "The phenomenon by which certain organisms, often with a specific ecological niche, regulate the population dynamics of other organisms by preying upon them, thereby maintaining community stability and preventing excessive growth or dominance.", "The phenomenon by which species with voracious appetites and razor-sharp defenses exert a dominating influence over the distribution and abundance of foreign entities that venture into their territory.", "The act of one organism actively controlling the population growth of another through consumption or consumption-like mechanisms, playing a crucial role in shaping the community's composition and structure, with its intensity often varying across geographic regions and ecosystems."], "latitudinal gradients": ["The consistent pattern of varying ecological properties and processes along a spatial axis, where local conditions, such as species diversity and predator-prey interactions, change predictably with distance from the equator, ultimately influencing the dynamics of biological invasions.", "A phenomenon in which the distribution, abundance, or ecological interactions of organisms vary in a consistent and systematic manner across different geographical zones, potentially influenced by factors such as climate, species composition, and evolutionary pressures.", "A systematic variation in ecological patterns and processes that occurs over a gradual shift from a region characterized by rich native species diversity and complex food webs to a region with reduced native diversity and simpler food webs, resulting in a distinct distribution of non-native species.", "The gradual progression of ecological characteristics and phenomena along a longitudinal axis, often reflecting differential environmental pressures and species adaptations that shape the distribution and abundance of organisms across geographic regions.", "The phenomenon where the intensity of ecological forces that shape the distribution and abundance of species increases or decreases as one moves closer to or further from the equator, influencing the likelihood of successful invasions and the outcome of predator-prey interactions."], "biotic resistance": ["The native
