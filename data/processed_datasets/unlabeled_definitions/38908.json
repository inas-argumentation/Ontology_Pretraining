implications."], "r. venosa": ["A type of marine mollusk, native to the Pacific Ocean but introduced to foreign waters, where it has established an invasive population that has significant ecological implications.", "A large, non-native marine gastropod that has invaded coastal areas, exerting ecological impacts and posing a management challenge, particularly in regards to controlling its population and mitigating its effects on native species.", "A non-native, invasive marine gastropod that has established a foothold in Argentinean waters, potentially altering the local food chain and ecosystem balance.", "A non-native, marine snail that has become an unwelcome guest in certain coastal areas, posing a threat to the ecological balance and requiring careful management to prevent its further spread.", "A large, invasive marine snail native to the Indo-Pacific region, known for its ability to establish itself in new territories and potentially disrupt the local ecosystem, which has recently become a topic of interest in the scientific community due to its predation by a small shark species in Argentinean waters."], "mustelus schmitii": ["A species of small marine predator that has been observed to exert a crucial role in controlling the population of invasive marine gastropods, playing a vital part in the delicate balance of the coastal ecosystem.", "A small, yet effective
