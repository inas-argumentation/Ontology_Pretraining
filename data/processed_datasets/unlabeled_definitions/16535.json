dispersal and adaptation of individuals to distinct environments, and often resulting in a non-random distribution of genetic traits across a geographic range.", "The variation in the distribution of a specific trait or characteristic within a population, reflecting the spatial arrangement of its ancestry, migration, and genetic drift, as observed through the analysis of allelic frequencies and genotypic compositions across different locations.", "The distribution of variations in the characteristics of a population, shaped by the physical environment and historical events, which can be visualized as a landscape of diversity, where different regions exhibit distinct profiles of genetic, phenotypic, or morphological features.", "The distribution of specific genetic characteristics

reflected in the differences between its gene copies, which can shape the way it adapts to its environment and is distributed across different regions.", "The intrinsic variation in the chemical makeup of an organism's biological blueprint, which can manifest as differences in the traits and characteristics that are passed down from one generation to the next, allowing for adaptation and resilience in the face of environmental changes and spatial distribution.", "The innate diversity of characteristics that exist among individuals within a population, resulting from differences in their hereditary makeup, which can lead to varying adaptations to their environment and may be influenced by historical events such as introductions to new regions, such as the introduction of the
