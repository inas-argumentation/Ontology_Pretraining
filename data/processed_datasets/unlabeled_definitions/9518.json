cost of decreased defense mechanisms, following a sudden reduction in natural predation pressure.", "The phenomenon wherein invasive species adapt to new environments by discarding defensive mechanisms and emphasizing competitive advantages, fostering accelerated growth and colonization.", "The tendency for invasive species to optimize their resource acquisition strategies by sacrificing defense mechanisms, allowing them to outcompete native species and thrive in novel environments.", "The propensity of invasive species to adaptively optimize their resource acquisition and allocation
