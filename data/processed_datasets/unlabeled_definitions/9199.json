shell-dweller with a predilection for decimating populations of introduced bivalves in eelgrass habitats, thereby contributing to the ecological balance of invaded ecosystems."], "predator exclusion": ["The removal of a key biological force that would normally exert a controlling influence on the population dynamics of a non-native species, allowing its population to expand unimpeded and potentially alter the native ecosystem.", "A method of controlling the impact of a dominant invasive species by separating it from its natural predators, thereby allowing the predators to exploit the invasive species' natural mortality mechanisms and maintain the ecological balance in the invaded habitat.", "The deliberate separation of a species from its natural enemies, achieved through artificial means, with the goal of quantifying the impact of predation on population dynamics and ecological interactions.", "The artificial removal of a top-down control mechanism from an ecosystem, allowing a dominant species to grow unchecked and reveal the underlying dynamics of the community, thereby exposing the ecological importance of that previously regulating force.", "A technique used to isolate a particular organism's natural defenses or behaviors, simulating a hypothetical absence of predation pressures to determine its inherent survival and population growth rates in a specific environment."], "resistance": ["The capacity of an ecosystem to withstand and mitigate the impact of an invasive species by virtue of the interactions between native components, resulting in a dampening of its ability to alter the environment and potentially outcompete native inhabitants.", "The natural barrier against the spread and establishment of non-native species, maintained by the interactions between native predators, prey populations, and the environment, which ultimately regulates the distribution and impact of invasive organisms on the recipient community.", "The ability of an ecosystem to maintain its native balance and structure by harnessing the power of its native predators, which in turn suppress the growth and impact of non-native species, thereby safeguarding the ecosystem's natural integrity and diversity.", "The ability of an ecosystem to mitigate the impact of non-native species by harnessing the natural regulatory mechanisms of its native components,
