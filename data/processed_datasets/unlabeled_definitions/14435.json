high degree of vulnerability to invasion by exotic plant species.", "A temperate grassland ecosystem characterized by the dominance of perennial grasses that have adapted to withstand recurring burning and grazing, and which often require the application of targeted management practices to maintain a resilient community structure and ensure the coexistence of diverse native plant and animal

altered patterns of species distribution, abundance, or functional relationships.", "The lingering impact of a management strategy on an ecosystem's composition and diversity, persisting even after the strategy has been discontinued or altered, leaving a lasting imprint on the community's structure and function."]}
