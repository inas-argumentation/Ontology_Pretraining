ecosystem long after the original cause has been removed, influencing the trajectory of recovery and restoration efforts.", "The lingering imprint of a dominant, non-indigenous organism on its invaded ecosystem, manifesting as a residual impact on community composition, ecosystem function, and physical properties, which persists even after the organism's removal and can hinder the restoration of the ecosystem to its pre-disturbed state.", "The lasting and often profound impact that the presence of a nonnative species has on the ecological processes and community structures within a habitat, continuing to influence the environment even after the species has been removed or becomes extinct.", "The lingering impacts that can occur when an external agent has disrupted the delicate balance of a community or ecosystem, resulting in a residual effect that can continue to influence the dynamics of the system even after the agent is removed, potentially hindering restoration efforts."], "soil
