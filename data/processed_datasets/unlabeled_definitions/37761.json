{"dilution rate": ["The rate at which the proportion of a specific entity in a mixture is gradually reduced as it is combined with a larger amount of a different substance, allowing it to spread and potentially adapt to new conditions.", "The measure of how quickly the characteristics of a water body are altered by the introduction of a substance or agent, influenced by factors such as the quantity of the substance, its origin, and the surrounding environmental conditions.", "The measure of the gradual diminishment of the original concentration of organisms or substances in a mixture as it becomes increasingly diluted with another substance, such as seawater, affecting their potential to establish themselves in a new environment.", "The rate at which a foreign substance is dispersed and diluted within a larger volume of a new environment, thereby altering its concentration and potential impact, such as the introduction of alien microorganisms into a recipient ecosystem.", "The measure of the reduction in potency or concentration of a particular organism, in this case phytoplankton, that occurs when it is introduced into a new environment and is subsequently influenced by the presence of other substances, such as nutrient-rich media, or changed conditions, like variations in water temperature or salinity."], "time delay": ["The interval between the introduction of an organism to a new environment and its subsequent establishment, during which the organism must adapt to new conditions, such as temperature and nutrient availability, before it can begin to grow exponentially.", "The interval between a species' introduction to a new environment and its initial exponential growth, influenced by factors such as the availability of essential resources, including nutrients and suitable temperatures.", "The period between the initial introduction of a non-native organism into a new environment and the onset of its exponential growth, during which the organism's adaptation to the changed conditions allows it to regain its optimal metabolic pace.", "The period during which a biological assemblage adjusts to new environmental conditions, slowing down its initial growth and survival rate, before it can thrive and reach its full potential in a new ecological setting.", "The interval between the introduction of an invasive species into a new environment and its peak growth, during which it adapts to the changed conditions and prepares for rapid proliferation."]}
