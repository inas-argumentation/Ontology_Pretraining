{"genetic bottlenecks": ["The sudden reduction in a species' gene pool size, resulting from a severe population decline or isolation, which can lead to the loss of genetic variation and make a species more prone to struggling to adapt to new environments.", "The sudden reduction in the overall range of genetic characteristics present in a population, often resulting from a limited number of founders or individuals who establish a new colony, leaving fewer options for adaptation and evolutionary flexibility in response to novel environmental pressures.", "The reduction in the variability of a species' gene pool during the introduction to a new environment, often resulting from a significant decline in population size, which can limit the species' ability to adapt and evolve in response to changing conditions.", "A reduction in the overall variety of characteristics among the founding members of a species' population, resulting in a loss of adaptive potential and increased vulnerability to extinction, which can occur during the process of establishing a new population in a foreign environment.", "The phenomenon by which a reduced population size, often due to founder effects or environmental pressures, can result in the loss of genetic variation and potentially compromise the ability of a species to adapt to its new surroundings."], "evolutionary rescue": ["The rapid adjustment of an organism's gene pool to novel environmental conditions, facilitated by an influx of new genetic material, enabling it to recover and thrive in an altered ecological setting.", "The process by which a species, having been introduced to a novel environment, rapidly generates genetic variation to adapt to changing ecological pressures, thereby avoiding local extinction and establishing a thriving population.", "The phenomenon where a species, introduced to a novel environment, rapidly adapts and thrives through genetic changes that enable it to survive and outcompete native species, facilitated by increased genetic variation and the ability to evolve quickly in response to selective pressures.", "The phenomenon whereby a previously vulnerable population, introduced to a novel environment, rapidly adapts and thrives through the emergence of adaptive traits, allowing it to overcome initial difficulties and establish a stronghold in its new habitat.", "The process by which a population's genetic makeup is reconfigured through rapid adaptation to a new environment, allowing it to overcome initial disadvantages and thrive in its novel habitat, often facilitated by the presence of genetic variation."]}
