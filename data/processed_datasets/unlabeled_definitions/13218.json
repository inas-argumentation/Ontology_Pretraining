predators in urban lakes where native snail populations have been depleted due to environmental degradation."], "littoral food web": ["A complex network of interconnected organisms that thrive in the shallow, coastal zone of a body of water, where terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems converge, and are shaped by the dynamic interplay of environmental degradation, human activities, and the presence of both native and non-native species.", "A network of ecological relationships that connects organisms that inhabit the areas adjacent to bodies of water, where energy flows through a dynamic interplay between species that thrive on the interface between land and water, and those that rely on aquatic resources, ultimately supporting a diverse range of consumers that occupy this liminal zone.", "A complex network of organisms that thrive in the shallow, shore-based zones of freshwater ecosystems, where water and land interfaces support a dynamic interplay of predator-prey relationships, energy flows, and ecological interactions that underpin the resilience and structure of the ecosystem's functional framework.", "A complex network of interactions between aquatic organisms and their environment, where benthic resources such as plants and animals are converted into energy that is transferred up the food chain, often shaped by the physical and ecological changes that occur at the transition zone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.", "A network of interactions and energy flow between organisms that occupy the interface between a lake's water and surrounding land, where changes in habitat and resource availability can significantly impact the entire ecosystem's balance and functioning."], "trophic cul de sac": ["A path of energy transfer in a food web where environmental degradation or other disturbances divert a significant portion of basal energy towards lower trophic levels, potentially excluding higher trophic level consumers from essential food
