resources, influencing environmental factors, or providing protection, leading to a dynamic exchange of benefits that can alter the behavior and outcome of their interactions.", "The harmonious or antagonistic relationship between a plant and another microorganism, where the partners exchange resources, information, or genetic material, and collectively influence the plant's growth, development, and interactions with other species in its community, often leading to reciprocal benefits or costs."]}
