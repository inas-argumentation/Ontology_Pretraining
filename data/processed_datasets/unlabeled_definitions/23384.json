{"naturalised species": ["A species that has migrated to an area where it does not naturally occur, often through human activity or natural processes, and has successfully established a self-sustaining population that coexists with native species.", "Species that, despite being introduced to a foreign environment, have established a sustainable population through natural processes, with their distribution now reflecting a complex interplay of biogeographical and ecological factors, blurring the lines between their initial origin and subsequent adaptation.", "Species that have successfully colonized a foreign region, often as a result of human activity, and have adapted to its environment to the extent that they coexist with native organisms, yet remain distinguishable from them.", "A species that has established a reproductive presence in a location where its ancestors did not naturally occur, often facilitated by human activities, and has adapted to thrive in this new environment, blurring the lines between its original and acquired habitats.", "A species that, through human-mediated or unaided migration, has established a self-sustaining population in a region where it is not indigenous, often exhibiting a characteristic ease of growth and adaptation, yet remains fundamentally distinct from native species in terms of its origin and ecological role."]}
