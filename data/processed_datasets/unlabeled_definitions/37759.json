invasive species, allowing for the maintenance of a healthy and balanced ecosystem.", "A physical structure designed to selectively regulate the migration of aquatic species between different water

contributing to the conservation of native ecosystems.", "A physical structure designed to control the movement of aquatic species between two bodies of water, restricting the upstream passage of unwanted fish while allowing downstream movement, thereby facilitating the management and conservation of native fish populations.", "A device or structure designed to regulate the movement of aquatic organisms between two bodies of water, typically allowing species to pass in one direction while preventing others from moving upstream or into a targeted area, thereby helping to maintain a balanced ecosystem and control invasive species populations.", "A specialized structure designed to permit downstream passage of aquatic organisms while restricting upstream migration of non-native, invasive species, thereby facilitating the management of invaded ecosystems.", "A mechanism designed to regulate the movement of aquatic organisms, restricting the upstream migration of certain species while
