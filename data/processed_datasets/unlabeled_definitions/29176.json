human and natural means, with a strong preference for settling in reservoirs and higher-order reaches, exhibiting a dominant downstream dispersal pattern.", "A recently introduced, widespread and adaptable fish species that has been able to rapidly colonize and expand its range through human-assisted and natural dispersal mechanisms, often preferring habitats with altered flow regimes.", "A large, opportunistic fish species that has established a presence in a new aquatic environment, its movements driven by both human and natural factors, and whose spread can be tracked and analyzed through online sources.", "A large, non-native fish species known for its ability to quickly spread along rivers, typically inhabiting reservoirs and higher reaches, with its distribution often influenced by human activities and natural dispersal events."], "online information": ["Data generated from digital platforms, collectively contributed by individuals with direct experience or observational records of specific species or events, providing valuable insights into their distribution, behavior, and dispersal patterns.", "Digitally disseminated intel gathered from virtual

communities, that provide insights into the geographic spread and patterns of non-native species.", "Geographically scattered and publicly accessible data obtained through digital platforms, often volunteered by individuals with firsthand experience, and providing valuable insights into the distribution and behavior of invasive species."], "online data": ["Information generated through digital channels, primarily originating from online communities, forums, and platforms, which can provide valuable insights into the distribution and spread patterns of invasive species.", "Information gathered from digital platforms, such as online communities, social media, and websites, that provides a window into the spread and behavior of invasive species, often obtained through grassroots reporting and personal experiences.", "Electronic information disseminated through digital platforms, originating from diverse sources, often crowdsourced and used to illustrate patterns of invasive species distribution, behavior, and movement in aquatic ecosystems.", "Information garnered through digital channels, typically comprising a diverse array of user-generated content and public records, which can be analyzed to reveal spatial patterns and trends regarding the distribution and dispersal of non-native species.", "Digital records and information collected through virtual platforms and communication channels, often crowdsourced from diverse sources, such as online forums, websites, and social media platforms, which provide valuable insights into the distribution and dispersal patterns of non-native species."], "invasive fishes": ["Aquatic organisms that have colonized a new territory, often facilitated by human activity, and can outcompete native species for resources and habitat, leading to changes in ecosystem dynamics and potentially causing harm to the environment and human interests.", "Aquatic species that have been introduced to a new ecosystem, either intentionally or unintentionally, and have established themselves, often outcompeting native species for resources, space, and habitats, and may cause harm to the ecological balance and economy of the affected area.", "Aquatic organisms that, through human activity or natural processes, have expanded their geographic range and now occupy areas where they are not native, often altering the local ecosystem and potentially disrupting the balance of native species.", "Fish species that have spread beyond their original geographic range, often due to human activity or natural means, and can disrupt the native ecosystem balance by competing for resources, altering habitats, or preying on native species.", "Species of fish that, through their introduction and subsequent dispersal, alter the ecological balance and potentially outcompete native species for resources in a particular waterbody or region, requiring concerted management efforts to mitigate their impacts."], "invasive fish species": ["A species of fish that rapidly colonizes and establishes self-sustaining populations in new geographical areas, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering ecosystem dynamics, frequently through human-mediated introductions and assisted dispersal.", "A species of aquatic organisms that, through unintentional or deliberate human action, rapidly expands its geographic range into new habitats, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering the ecological balance, posing significant threats to native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",
