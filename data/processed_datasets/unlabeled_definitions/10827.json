and the disruption of natural processes, leading to a reduced ability to respond to environmental changes and maintain ecosystem resilience."], "urbanization": ["The transformation of natural habitats into areas characterized by high human population density, where alterations to environmental conditions and processes lead to the invasion of non-native species, extinction of native species, and modification of ecosystems, ultimately affecting the diversity of plant communities.", "The process by which natural habitats are replaced by densely populated and industrialized areas, leading to a complex interplay of factors that can either promote differentiation in species composition and functional traits or homogenize communities through exotic invasions, native extinctions, and alterations to habitats and natural processes.", "The process by which natural ecosystems are gradually transformed into artificial landscapes, resulting in a significant reduction of native species and an influx of non-native organisms, ultimately leading to a homogenization of plant diversity.", "The gradual replacement of natural habitats with human-dominated landscapes, leading to a complex
