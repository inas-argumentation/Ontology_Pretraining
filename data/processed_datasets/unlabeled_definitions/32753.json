taxonomic identity, with its presence confirmed in numerous lakes across the region.", "A small, invasive aquatic crustacean native to Eurasia, characterized by its elongated claws and subtle variations in morphology, which has spread to North American lakes, often mistakenly identified as other species, and whose genetic purity has been questioned due to potential hybridization with other species of the same genus.", "A North American aquatic invader that, despite initial misidentification, has been confirmed to be a specific species, characterized by distinct morphological features
