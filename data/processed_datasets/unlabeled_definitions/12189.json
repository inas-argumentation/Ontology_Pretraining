{"density-dependent establishment": ["The ability of individual members of a newly introduced species to successfully establish themselves in a community, where the success of each individual is directly influenced by the presence and abundance of other individuals of the same species that have also been introduced, resulting in a decreased probability of establishment as the number of introduced individuals increases beyond a certain threshold.", "The extent to which the likelihood of successful colonization by invasive species is influenced by the density of existing competitors or members of the resident community, such that high densities can strongly inhibit or even eliminate the establishment of new individuals, particularly for species with limited or specialized colonization strategies.", "The process by which the likelihood of successful colonization decreases as the number of individuals introduced to a community increases, leading to a threshold where additional introductions have a diminishing impact on establishment.", "The process by which the likelihood of successful colonization by individual propagules decreases exponentially with increasing numbers of introductions or propagule sizes, as a result of the cumulative impact of community resistance on the establishment of each individual propagule.", "The process by which the likelihood of individual establishment declines exponentially as the number of conspecifics in the introduced population increases, resulting in a critical point beyond which further increases in population size no longer yield proportional gains in successful colonization."], "density dependence": ["The phenomenon by which the fate of an individual or group is influenced by the presence and abundance of similar individuals or groups within the same environment, leading to altered outcomes in establishment, growth, and persistence.", "The extent to which the presence or arrival of additional individuals of a species within a community influences the probability of successful establishment or survival of those individuals, potentially leading to diminishing returns in the face of increasing population density.", "The phenomenon where the effect of external factors, such as the number of individuals introduced in an invasion, on the establishment and survival of individuals within a community is diminished as the size of the group increases, ultimately leading to a non-linear and potentially saturating response.", "The manner in which the fate of individual organisms, whether native or invasive, becomes increasingly influenced by the presence and density of other organisms in their environment as population numbers grow, ultimately determining the success or failure of a species in establishing itself within a particular ecosystem.", "The phenomenon where the rate of successful colonization by individual seeds is hindered as the overall introduction size increases, resulting in an exponentially decreasing likelihood of establishment."], "seed size": ["The physical characteristic of a plant propagule that influences the likelihood of successful establishment and competition for resources in a novel environment, often corresponding to the amount of stored energy or resource investment in each individual unit of dispersal.", "The characteristic dimension that determines the likelihood of a colonizing organism to establish itself in a new environment, being influenced by the balance between the energetic costs of dispersal and the benefits of successful settlement.", "The characteristic that distinguishes a pioneer's chance at settling into a new landscape, often manifesting as a numerical quantity representing the individual units of reproductive material dispersed at a time, whose variation has been shown to influence the likelihood of successful establishment in invasive species.", "The characteristic measurement of the physical quantity that determines the amount of material contained within a specific portion of a plant, where larger values typically indicate greater capacity for germination and establishment, but may also be susceptible to diminished returns in certain environmental contexts.", "The fundamental parameter of reproductive dispersion that determines the initial colonization momentum of a foreign species, encompassing the number of individuals released into a new environment per introduction event, which subsequently influences the probability of successful establishment and invasion."], "seedling recruitment": ["The process by which individual introductions of a species to a new environment result in the establishment of a critical mass of new individuals, often governed by complex interactions between the species' life history traits and the resistance of the receiving community.", "The process by which individual introductions of plant species into a community influence the likelihood of successful colonization, with the probability of establishment declining as the frequency and density of such introductions increase, ultimately resulting in a complex interplay between the traits of the introduced species and the resistance of the receiving ecosystem.", "The process by which individual introductions of a plant species interact with their environment, resulting in the successful establishment of a subset of introduced individuals, determined by the intrinsic traits of the species and the resistance of the resident community.", "The process by which an initial introduction of organisms, characterized by variable population sizes and species composition, leads to the establishment of a new population through the successful germination and growth of individual individuals, with establishment probability influenced by interactions between functional traits, community composition, and the number of individuals introduced.", "The process by which individual plants begin their lives in a new environment, characterized by an initial investment of energy and resources, which can be influenced by various factors including the density of existing plant populations and the magnitude of introduction events."], "seed rain": ["The scattered arrival of numerous individuals, often exhibiting a pattern of diminishing returns, which collectively contribute to the establishment of a species in a given ecosystem, with their cumulative effect determined by the interaction of their functional traits with the local biotic community and environment.", "The aggregate arrival of reproductive propagules in a given area, influenced by the intensity of introduction events, which can impact the likelihood of successful colonization and the subsequent ecological dynamics of the receiving community, with diminishing returns occurring when propagule pressure exceeds a certain threshold.", "The process by which the aggregate of dispersal events, characterized by varying intensities and densities, influences the successful establishment of non-native species by interacting with the existing community composition, thereby shaping the likelihood of invasion and the fate of individual propagules.", "The cumulative effect of multiple introduction events, characterized by a varying quantity of individuals, which collectively shape the invasion success of non-native species in a community.", "The arrival of a specific quantity of reproductive propagules from a given species, released into an environment, where the actual establishment of individuals from these propagules is influenced by a delicate interplay of factors, including the presence and composition of the local community, and the number of initial introductions, leading to an exponentially decreasing likelihood of successful establishment with increasing arrival rate."]}
