minimizing the influence of other external factors that could potentially skew or mask the actual effects of that variable.", "Mechanisms in place to isolate the specific effects of a treatment by

species.", "The deliberate and controlled elimination of established species within a community to gauge the resilience of the remaining organisms and the ecosystem as a whole, providing insights into the complex dynamics of invasion and disturbance responses.", "The intentional manipulation of a ecosystem by physically or chemically removing a native or invasive species from a specific area to assess the community's response, including changes in biodiversity and functional characteristics, with the goal of understanding the underlying mechanisms of resistance to invasion and recovery from

species and communities to the absence of certain invasive or non-native species."], "functional richness": ["The cumulative capacity of a plant community to perform a range of ecological roles, such as nutrient cycling, pollination, and habitat provision, as measured by the diversity of species with different ecological traits that contribute to the community's overall resilience and

vulnerable to invasion by non-native species.", "The variety of ecosystem services and processes that a plant community can provide or perform, which is often diminished when invasive species displace native species, indicating a loss of overall community functionality.", "The variety and complexity of essential ecological roles fulfilled by different components within a community, which can be diminished or shifted by the introduction and removal of invasive species.", "The collective ability of a community's inhabitants to perform a range of ecological tasks, such as resource utilization, habitat modification, and predator-prey dynamics, which can be compromised by the introduction of invasive species and restored through the removal of those species."], "community resistance": ["The ability of a plant community to maintain its structural and functional integrity, despite the presence of invasive species, and to gradually regain its original composition and dynamics after their removal, reflecting the complex interactions between native and non-native plants and their shared environment.", "The ability of a resident species ensemble to resist the establishment or spread of an alien organism within its boundaries, thereby preserving its structural and functional integrity.", "The capacity of a biological ensemble to maintain its native composition and functioning by impeding or resisting the spread and establishment of alien species, ultimately influencing the local species coexistence and ecosystem processes.", "The natural ability of a group of plants to withstand and repel the entry and spread of alien species, thereby preserving their ecological integrity and diversity.", "The ability of a native plant assembly to withstand and deflect the encroachment of non-native species, ensuring the persistence of its inherent characteristics and functions, thereby maintaining the integrity of its ecological balance."], "removal experiments": ["A type of research investigation that involves purposefully eliminating native species from an ecosystem to analyze the subsequent impact on the remaining native species, as well as the ability of the ecosystem to recover and maintain its integrity.", "Experimental designs that intentionally eliminate a portion of a plant community to investigate how the remaining organisms respond and adapt to the resulting changes in composition and structure, with the goal of understanding the complex interactions between resident species and invasive species in the context of community invasion and

ability to resist and recover from the impact of invasion, while also controlling for potential confounding factors.", "A controlled scientific method used to study the interactions between a resident community and an invasive species by intentionally manipulating the composition of the community to observe its subsequent response, particularly in the context of understanding the community's

ability to rebound from the impact of an invasive presence.", "The dynamic adjustment and rebalancing of a plant assemblage after the removal of a non-native species, which may involve a reconfiguration of ecological roles and interactions among remaining community members, resulting in a new stable state.", "The process by which a ecological system, once impacted by the presence of
