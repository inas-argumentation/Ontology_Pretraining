vegetation and the decline of invasive or non-native species.", "The cessation of human activities that allows previously disturbed or managed land to revert to a natural state, potentially leading to the regeneration of native vegetation and the establishment of new, novel ecosystems, such as secondary forests, often characterized by increased species richness and community complexity.", "The cessation of anthropogenic activities on a specific plot of land, allowing it to revert to a state of natural succession, often characterized by the proliferation of exotic plant species and the potential for native species to recede from areas with increased isolation from previously intact habitats.", "The cessation of human activities on a specific area of land, resulting in the recovery of native ecosystems and the proliferation of secondary forest growth, often accompanied by an influx of exotic species."], "secondary forests": ["Landscapes arising from reforestation or natural succession in areas previously degraded or cleared of their original vegetation, where pioneer species often give way to more mature assemblages of plants and trees, shaped by interactions with local soil conditions and distant forest influences.", "Forests regenerating from land abandonment, characterized by a diverse mix of native and non-native tree species, which exhibit distinct responses to environmental gradients, such as distance to mature forests and soil nutrient levels.", "A type of forest that emerges in previously disturbed or land-abandoned areas, characterized by a rapid and dynamic process of ecological succession, where exotic species often dominate the initial stages of regeneration, and native species richness may decline with increasing isolation from ancestral habitats.", "Areas that have recently transitioned from one land use or cover type to another, resulting in a complex ecosystem where the mix of native and non-native plant species is shaped by human activities and environmental factors, such as soil properties and proximity to older, more mature forests.", "Areas of previously human-altered landscapes that have regrown with vegetation, often dominated by woody plant species that have colonized the site, and are characterized by a mix of native and non-native species, with community composition and structure influenced by local environmental conditions and historical land-use patterns."], "old-growth forest": ["A naturally evolved ecological community that has existed for an extended period of time, characterized by a high degree of spatial and temporal continuity, and featuring a complex web of interdependencies among its constituents, which is particularly sensitive to external influences and fragmentation, and therefore provides a unique context for understanding the relationships between tree species diversity and environmental gradients.", "A type of forest ecosystem characterized by the presence of mature trees, with canopy closure and dense understory vegetation, where ecological processes have developed over a prolonged period, shaping the soil chemistry and microclimate, and providing a refuge for a unique assemblage of species, including those with a historical association with these forests.", "A mature and complex ecosystem characterized by a high level of structural and compositional integrity, often exhibiting a mix of native tree species, varying canopy layers, and dense understory vegetation, which has developed over centuries or millennia with minimal human disturbance and is now a key factor in shaping the diversity of flora and fauna in its vicinity.", "A mature forest ecosystem characterized by a natural lack of human disturbance and the presence of unique ecological processes, which allows for the development of complex structural and compositional patterns, including high levels of tree diversity, density, and canopy cover, with distant stands serving as a reference point for species composition and structure.", "A mature and pristine ecological habitat that has developed over centuries, characterized by a complex structure and high levels of biodiversity, serving as a benchmark for the health and resilience of the surrounding landscape, and playing a crucial role in maintaining the regional ecosystem's integrity."], "forest regeneration": ["The natural or assisted process of ecological revitalization in a previously degraded or altered landscape, characterized by the gradual resurgence of native tree species and re-establishment of ecological connections to old-growth forest areas, while also allowing for the coexistence of non-native species adapted to specific soil conditions, thereby promoting a dynamic balance between native and exotic species in the regenerating ecosystem.", "The spontaneous process by which a disturbed or degraded land area gradually transforms into a thriving ecosystem, characterized by the reestablishment of diverse plant communities, reforestation, and ecological revitalization, often facilitated by natural succession or intentional conservation efforts.", "The natural process by which areas once devoid of tree cover undergo transformation, allowing native and non-native tree species to coexist, adapt, and diversify in response to local environmental factors, such as soil chemistry and landscape configuration, resulting in a complex network of ecological interactions and relationships.", "The natural or assisted recovery of a degraded or devastated land area into a diverse and self-sustaining ecosystem characterized by a mosaic of vegetation structures, soil fertility, and community compositions, often facilitated by historical connections to a remnant stand of a pristine or undisturbed habitat.", "The spontaneous recolonization and reestablishment of a plant community in areas that were previously cleared or disturbed,
