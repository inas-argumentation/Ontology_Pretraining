that, despite its initial presence in a particular area, now faces a significant threat to its survival due to human activities or other environmental pressures, and is protected by conservation efforts to prevent its extinction, while its non-native populations in other areas may also be causing harm to local ecosystems.", "A type of species that, despite facing extinction threats in its original habitat, has also managed to establish a foothold in a new location, thus creating a conundrum for conservation efforts that must balance the need to protect its native population with the

a dilemma that challenges our traditional notions of conservation.", "A circumstance where two seemingly incompatible conservation goals, such as preserving a vulnerable native species and safeguarding an invaded ecosystem, are simultaneously pursued, highlighting the need for nuanced decision-making and a deep understanding of the complex interplay between ecological processes and human actions.", "The seemingly contradictory circumstances where two conflicting goals or principles are simultaneously threatened or advanced by the same action, often arising from the intersection of conservation and human intervention in ecosystems, and requiring a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between native and non-native species.", "A phenomenon in which two
