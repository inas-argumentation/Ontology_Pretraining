expected duration in a particular environment, following its initial release or introduction.", "The time period within which the potency of a toxic substance gradually decreases, resulting in a dramatic decrease in its adverse effects on an organism's well-being.", "The point at which the potency of a substance, such as a pollutant, diminishes by half over a specified period, a measure of its rate of dissipation in an aquatic environment.", "The time it takes for a substance's potency to diminish by half when exposed to environmental degradation, measured through the disappearance of its toxic effects on aquatic organisms.", "The amount of time it takes for a substance's concentration to decrease by half when it follows a predictable rate of decline in a given environment, illustrating the dynamic interaction between a chemical and its surroundings."], "toxicity": ["The degree to which a substance can disrupt the normal biological functioning of an organism, potentially causing harm or even mortality, often determined by its chemical composition and exposure concentration.", "The measure of an organism's susceptibility to harm caused by the gradual breakdown and degradation of a toxic substance, which is capable of altering its biological processes and potentially leading to impaired physiological functions and even death.", "The extent to which the exposure to a substance disrupts the natural functioning and integrity of an organism, resulting in adverse effects on its biological systems, survival, and reproduction.", "The property of a substance or agent that measures its capacity to harm or disrupt the normal functioning of living organisms or ecosystems, often manifesting as adverse effects on physiological processes, behavior, or survival rates, and influenced by factors such as concentration, exposure duration, and environmental context.", "The degree to which a substance disrupts the natural balance and viability of an organism, measured by its impact on an organism's physiological, behavioral, or reproductive processes."]}
