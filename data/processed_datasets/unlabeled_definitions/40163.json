man-made or natural pathways, and are now thriving in a new environment, potentially disrupting the local ecosystem balance.", "Fish species that have made a successful transition from tropical Indo-Pacific waters to the Mediterranean basin, where they have adapted to new prey and predators, and now thrive in an ecosystem previously unexposed to their presence.", "Organisms that have naturally dispersed from a warm-water region to a new, temperate or Mediterranean ecosystem, often with unintended consequences on native biodiversity, and exhibiting a tendency to establish populations that can wreak havoc on the delicate balance of the invaded ecosystem.", "Marine animals of a species native to the Indian Ocean, which have naturally migrated through the Suez Canal and have established non-native populations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, potentially disrupting the native ecosystem and outcompeting local species for food and habitat.", "Marine animals that are

populations, potentially disrupting the local food chain and ecosystem."], "lionfish invasion": ["The unchecked proliferation and predation by a non-native species that has invaded a previously unexploited aquatic environment, characteristically exhibiting crepuscular feeding habits and targeting small-bodied, benthic or bentho-pelagic native species that are naive to its presence and
