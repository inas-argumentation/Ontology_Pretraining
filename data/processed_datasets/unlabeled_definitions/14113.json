influence the persistence of vegetation, including invasive species.", "Rivers characterized by highly variable water flow and frequent episodes of drought, where plant growth and survival depend on occasional heavy rainfall events and associated flooding, which can lead to temporary increases in moisture availability and altered geomorphological conditions that influence the persistence of invasive plant species.", "A watercourse characterized by intermittent or periodic flow, with a limited supply of water, which contributes to a dynamic and fluctuating environment where plants must adapt to varying moisture levels and geomorphological conditions to persist."], "flood duration": ["The length of time during which a riparian zone's moisture levels are elevated beyond their typical drought conditions, resulting from the prolonged presence of water in the river channel, often influencing the growth and survival of invasive plant species.", "The period of time that a dryland river's water level remains elevated above its usual or natural state, influencing the growth and establishment of certain plant species, such as the invasive Noogoora burr.", "The length of time that excess water persists in a specific area, influencing the environment's capacity to support the growth and persistence of certain plant species.", "The time it takes for a river's water level to return to its pre-disturbance state after an invasion of annual plants has been interrupted by a sudden and significant increase in moisture.", "The time period during which the river maintains a heightened level of water and moisture, allowing exotic plant species to thrive, and providing a window of opportunity for establishment, growth, and persistence in its riparian zone."], "weed": ["A persistent, non-native vegetation that thrives in areas with altered hydrological conditions, often exploiting opportunities created by changes in water availability, and can outcompete native species for resources, potentially altering ecosystem dynamics.", "A type of plant that thrives in areas with variable water levels, often exploiting brief periods of increased moisture to establish and spread, thereby adapting to and potentially dominating local ecosystems through sheer resilience.", "A species of plant that, while thriving in environments with altered hydrological regimes, can rapidly spread and establish populations in new areas, where it may outcompete native vegetation for resources and alter ecosystem processes.", "A ubiquitous and often unwelcome plant species that thrives in environments with varying levels of moisture, able to adapt to a range of geomorphic conditions and exhibit resilience in the face of short-term flooding events, potentially forming dense populations on floodplains and benches.", "A type of invasive plant that thrives in modified or disturbed environments, often outcompeting native species and dominating areas with increased moisture availability, particularly in river systems with highly variable flooding patterns."], "flooding": ["The occurrence of excess water accumulating in an area, characterized by a temporary change in topography that enables exotic plant species to thrive, often followed by a prolonged period of increased moisture availability, thereby influencing their establishment and persistence.", "The sudden

that can impact the establishment and persistence of both native and non-native plant species.", "The temporary inundation of an area by excess water, resulting in increased moisture availability, which can stimulate plant growth and persistence, particularly in riverine environments.", "The periodic and often sudden influx of excess water into an area, typically occurring in a specific
