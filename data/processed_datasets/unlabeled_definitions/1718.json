same guild, resulting in a skewed dynamic of predator-prey interactions that can have significant implications for the balance of populations and the spread of invasive species.", "The phenomenon

consumes and devours another predator's immature life stage, often possessing chemical defenses that are typically intended to deter predation.", "The act of consuming or devouring reproductive units of a species, often as a means of sustenance or resource acquisition, potentially leading to a competitive disadvantage or reproductive decline in the consumed species, while potentially enhancing the
