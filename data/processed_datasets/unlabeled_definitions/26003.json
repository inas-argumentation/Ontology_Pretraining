new environment, often exhibiting rapid spread and potentially causing significant ecological, economic, and social impacts, requiring proactive management and control measures to mitigate its effects.", "A plant species that has established a foothold in a foreign environment and is capable of causing significant ecological, economic, or social harm, despite being absent from the area for an extended period of time, and is known to be present in multiple countries where it has achieved varying levels of invasiveness and impact.", "A non-native plant that has established a widespread presence in a new region, often causing ecological disruption, competition with native species, and degradation of habitats, requiring effective management strategies to mitigate its impacts.", "A non-native plant species that has spread beyond its initial point of introduction and is having a significant impact on the ecosystem, economy, or society, often through a combination of rapid reproduction, displacement of native species, and alteration of environmental processes, and whose continued presence poses a significant risk to the integrity and sustainability of the affected areas.", "A non-native plant species that has successfully established itself in a new region, often outcompeting native species for resources and space, and can potentially cause significant ecological, economic, and social harm."], "tree of heaven": ["A widespread and adaptable non-native plant species, native to Asia, that has spread to many parts of the world, often establishing dense stands and posing significant ecological and economic threats to its new environments.", "A woody invasive species known for its ability to establish itself in a wide range of environments and potentially spread to become a significant ecological concern.", "A deciduous tree native to Asia, characterized by its rapid spread and ability to thrive in a wide range of environments, often causing significant ecological and economic impacts when introduced to new regions.", "A plant species notorious for its rapid spread across diverse regions, able to thrive in areas with similar climatic conditions and often causing significant ecological and economic impacts when established.", "A towering and resilient invasive species that has colonized vast territories worldwide, with a propensity to outcompete native vegetation and adapt to diverse climates, posing a significant threat to ecosystems and requiring targeted management strategies to mitigate its impacts."], "naturalized species": ["A species that has established a persistent presence in a new region, having successfully adapted to the local environment and ecosystem, yet still lacks the significant ecological, economic, or social impacts characteristic of more invasive species.", "A plant species that has become well-established and widespread in a new geographic region through human activity, but has not yet caused significant ecological harm or economic disruption, often existing in a stable and self-sustaining population.", "A species that has established a foothold in a new region, often over a prolonged period, and is able to sustain itself in the wild, frequently with a broad distribution, but has not yet spread to dominate native ecosystems or cause significant ecological harm.", "A species that has established a persistent presence in a new region, often after being introduced through human activity, and has adapted to its new environment to some degree, but has not yet exerted significant ecological, economic, or social impacts.", "A plant species that has established a self-sustaining population in a new region, having transitioned from an introduced state to a stable presence, often displaying a moderate level of dispersal and adaptability, but not yet exhibiting the widespread expansion, ecological impacts, or invasive characteristics that are typical of a highly invasive species."], "invasive alien plant": ["A plant species that has been introduced to a non-native region through human activity, rapidly spreads beyond its initial point of introduction, and often causes significant ecological, economic, or societal harm, necessitating proactive management efforts to mitigate its impact and protect native ecosystems.", "A plant species that has migrated to a new geographical location, where it can outcompete native vegetation for resources and habitat, and its population can rapidly expand and establish itself in a significant proportion of the area, potentially causing ecological and economic harm.", "A non-native plant species that has established a presence in an ecosystem outside of its natural range and is capable of causing harm to the environment, economy, or human health through its growth, spread, and competitive dominance over native vegetation, often requiring significant management efforts to control or eradicate.", "A non-native species of plant that has successfully established itself in a new region, often outcompeting native flora and fauna, and can spread rapidly to colonize new areas, with potentially significant ecological, economic, and social impacts.", "A non-native plant species that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new region, often without sufficient ecological or biological checks, and has subsequently established a self-sustaining population, threatening to displace native species, alter ecosystem processes, or impose significant economic and social impacts."], "ailanthus": ["A certain deciduous tree species, notorious for its widespread and often destructive invasive tendencies, having adapted to thrive in varied environments across multiple continents, with a penchant for rapid colonization and dominance of new territories.", "A species of widespread and adaptable vegetation that, when introduced to new regions, has a propensity to rapidly naturalize and become invasive, with potential to exert significant ecological and economic impacts on native ecosystems and human infrastructure.", "A type of highly adaptable and opportunistic plant species that has exploited human activities and environmental niches to spread rapidly and widely across multiple continents, often outcompeting native species and causing
