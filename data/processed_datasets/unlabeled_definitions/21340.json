["A type of urban ecosystem characterized by a delicate balance between native and invasive species, where the loss of historical ecological influences can lead to a shift in community composition and resilience, requiring careful removal of invasive legacies and consideration of internal and external memory to achieve successful restoration.", "A community of native plant species that are embedded in a historical context of soil and microbial interactions, requiring preservation of the remnants of previous inhabitants to ensure the resilience of the entire ecosystem.", "A unique type of terrestrial ecosystem that is characterized by a blend of natural resilience and vulnerability, where the remnants of former inhabitants and the introduction of alien species can significantly impact the composition and function of the community, requiring a nuanced approach to ecological restoration.", "A delicate balance of plant and microbial remains, seeds, and spores that shape the formation of a novel community, where the ecological legacy of previous inhabitants still lingers, influencing the resilience of the ecosystem and the ease with which invasive species can take hold.", "A type of temperate ecosystem characterized by a unique combination of native plant and animal species that have co-evolved over time, with a reliance on specific soil properties and microbial networks that enable resilience to disturbances and support biodiversity, but is vulnerable to invasion by non-native species and requires active management to restore and maintain ecological integrity."], "resilience": ["The ability of an ecosystem to adapt and evolve over time, maintaining a delicate balance between its inherent characteristics and external factors, allowing it to absorb and recover from disturbances, while also influencing the trajectory of its own transformation.", "The capacity of a community or ecosystem to sustainably maintain its structural and functional integrity, even in the face of disturbances or changes, through the continued influence of its inherent properties and the gradual accumulation of environmental cues from past inhabitants.", "The ability of a system to adapt and evolve in response to changes, maintaining its stability and character despite disturbances, and potentially emerging with novel properties and interactions that shape its future

changes and disruptions, while also allowing for the emergence of novel and innovative patterns and processes.", "The capacity of a community or ecosystem to retain and adapt to the remnants of its past, enabling it to maintain a sense of continuity and stability amidst environmental changes and challenges, thereby influencing its ability to recover and thrive in the face of adversity."], "novel

ecological trajectory and a novel capacity for resilience.", "The unintended yet self-sustaining biological networks that emerge from the interaction between the remnants of a previous ecosystem and the invasive species that replace it, resulting in a distinctive configuration of species, populations, and ecosystem processes that is different from both the original and the original ecosystem in its ecological stability domain.", "A unique ecological formation resulting from the displacement of a native ecosystem, where remnants of the original community coexist with newly established invasive species, giving rise to a novel dynamic where species interact and adapt in novel ways, thereby creating a resilient but potentially altered ecosystem.", "A unique biological system that emerges when the ecological legacies of a site's previous inhabitants are reshaped by the establishment of alien invasive species, resulting in a new configuration of properties, species, and interactions that can exhibit different characteristics and stability domains.", "A dynamic ecosystem that emerges from the interplay between native and non-native species, where the remnants of a previous ecosystem's properties, combined with the ecological legacy of invasive species, shape a new stability domain with its own distinct resilience and ecological trajectory."], "alien invasive species": ["Species that take root in an unfamiliar environment, disrupting the ecological heritage of the site, and often becoming the driving force behind the creation of a new, self-sustaining community that is distinct from the original ecosystem's natural trajectory.", "A type of non-native organism that can displace the native ecological memory of an ecosystem, disrupting its natural stability and resilience, and potentially creating a novel ecosystem with a new ecological legacy.", "Species that exploit the lingering remnants of a previously existing ecological community, often altering the ecosystem's resilience and paving the way for a new stability domain to emerge, potentially leaving behind a new ecological memory.", "Species that arise from outside the historical

"Unnatural settlers that thrive in a foreign soil, often leaving behind a legacy that alters the native landscape, making it more susceptible to their return and establishment, and potentially creating a new ecological reality."]}
