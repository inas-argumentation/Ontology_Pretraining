procurement of wildlife, often serving as a proxy indicator of the relationship between humans and wildlife in a given ecosystem."], "bushmeat hunting": ["The hunting of wild animals for subsistence, usually in remote or resource-poor areas, where the practice is deeply ingrained in local culture and tradition, but often poses a significant threat to native wildlife populations and biodiversity.", "The practice of subsistence hunting in regions where the human population lives in close proximity to wildlife, often resulting in a reliance on non-native or alien species as a means of supplementing dietary needs, as seen in instances where certain invasive species have become culturally accepted sources of protein and income for remote communities.", "The practice of hunting and consuming wild game animals in rural or remote areas, often driven by cultural or subsistence needs, and can involve the killing of non-native or invasive species that have become a reliable food source.", "The practice of obtaining protein and other essential nutrients from wild, non-domesticated animals in remote or hard-to-reach areas, often driven by cultural and economic factors, and potentially altering the local ecological balance.", "The practice of hunting and consuming wild animals that inhabit non-protected areas, often in response to cultural and traditional dietary demands, which can have both direct and indirect impacts on native wildlife populations and ecosystems."], "feral pigs": ["A highly adaptable and opportunistic large mammal, native to certain parts of the world, that has thrived in human-altered environments by exploiting human food sources, and has become an integral component of local ecosystems and cultures.", "A species of wild swine that, due to its ability to thrive in human-altered environments and its adaptability to different ecological contexts, has become a readily available and culturally acceptable source of food for remote communities, often replacing the hunting of native wildlife.", "Wild, non-domesticated, and self-sustaining swine populations that, in certain ecosystems, can serve as a cultural and nutritional substitute for native wildlife, allowing for a reduction in hunting pressure on native species.", "A type of non-native, semi-wild mammal that thrives in a specific ecological niche, often serving as an unintended \"cultural fill-in\" for the native wildlife, providing a readily available source of sustenance and resources for local communities.", "A feral descendant of a previously domesticated species, thriving in a new environment and inadvertently filling a specific ecological niche by providing a readily available and culturally acceptable source of meat and oil, often becoming a substitute for the native wildlife that would otherwise be hunted."], "wildlife conservation": ["The process of maintaining the ecological balance and diversity of natural habitats by addressing the interconnected factors that threaten their integrity, including the deliberate introduction of non-native species, unsustainable hunting practices, and other human activities that can have far-reaching consequences for the long-term survival of species and ecosystems.", "The protection and preservation of natural ecosystems and the management of human-wildlife interactions to ensure the long-term persistence and integrity of biotic communities, often requiring the identification and mitigation of unexpected benefits and drawbacks resulting from human activities.", "The preservation and management of ecosystems and the protection of species that inhabit them, often requiring innovative solutions that balance human needs and environmental concerns.", "The proactive and holistic management of natural ecosystems to ensure the long-term persistence and health of a diverse range of species, while also balancing human needs and activities, ultimately preserving the integrity of the natural world for future generations.", "The long-term preservation and management of ecosystems to ensure the continued existence and well-being of a diverse range of non-domesticated animal populations, which often involves finding creative solutions to mitigate the negative effects of human activities, such as hunting and habitat degradation, and taking advantage of unexpected opportunities, such as the role of invasive species as a buffer to native wildlife."], "pantanal": ["A vast, subtropical wetland area teeming with wildlife and uniquely characterized by its lack of traditional hunting practices among its human inhabitants, where the presence of feral animals can paradoxically act as a protective buffer for native species and contribute to the area's conservation.", "A vast, subtropical wetland ecosystem where human settlements and wildlife coexist, often with unique conservation dynamics resulting from the presence of non-native species and cultural hunting practices.", "A vast, humid region in the heart of South America where traditional human settlement and agricultural practices coexist with a rich array of wildlife, often exhibiting unique relationships between introduced species and indigenous game populations.", "A vast, humid region in the Neotropics where unique coexistence of human settlements and wild habitats has led to the emergence of a complex ecosystem, where unexpected relationships between invasive species and human activities can have surprising conservation benefits, exemplified by the feral pigs' role as a substitute for native game.", "A vast, ecologically unique and inhabited region characterized by an unusual dynamic balance between human habitation and a surprising absence of native wildlife hunting, where certain invasive species have adapted to fill the niche, creating a complex conservation landscape."], "neotropics": ["The subtropical and tropical regions where human habitation is juxtaposed with an abundance of wildlife, yet conservation efforts are often hindered by the complex interplay of invasive species and subsistence hunting practices, which can have unforeseen consequences for native biodiversity.", "Regions characterized by a unique blend of ancient and modern cultures, where people coexist with a rich array of wildlife, often relying on sustainable
