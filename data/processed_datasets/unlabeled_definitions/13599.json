agriculture a subject of ongoing research and assessment.", "Plants cultivated for the purpose of producing energy in the form of fuels, often selected for their rapid growth rates and competitive nature, which can make them vulnerable to invasion and outcompete native species."], "weeds": ["Plants introduced for agronomic purposes that possess characteristics such as high competitiveness, fast growth rates, and large stature, potentially compromising native ecosystems and agricultural practices.", "Any non-native, fast-growing plant species that can outcompete established crops and agronomic species, potentially causing ecological and economic harm.", "Plant species intentionally introduced for agronomic purposes that have the potential to cause significant ecological and economic harm, often as a result of their competitive nature, rapid growth rate, and ability to outcompete native species for resources.", "Plant species intentionally introduced for agricultural purposes that possess traits associated with aggressive competition and rapid reproduction, often causing harm to local ecosystems and agricultural productivity, yet fail to be accurately distinguished from non-invasive crop species by existing risk assessment models.", "Plants that thrive in areas where they were not intentionally introduced, often exhibiting vigorous growth and competitiveness, and potentially disrupting ecological balance and human activities."], "screening": ["The process of evaluating potential biofuel crops for their invasiveness, involving a comprehensive assessment of their characteristics and attributes to determine their likelihood of becoming a nuisance, thus identifying those that may require additional scrutiny or regulation before widespread cultivation.", "The process of critically evaluating a prospective introduction to identify potential threats and assess its viability before widespread adoption, ensuring that the most suitable and safe options are selected.", "The process of preliminarily evaluating a candidate bioenergy crop or plant species to identify potential risks or characteristics that may impact its invasive potential, thereby enabling informed decisions about its cultivation and introduction into new environments.", "The process of preliminary evaluation and categorization of unfamiliar plant species, intended to identify potential risks and threats associated with their introduction and cultivation, with the aim of informing decision-making and regulatory frameworks.", "The process of filtering and categorizing plant species based on predetermined criteria, such as growth rate, competitiveness, and native vs. introduced origin, to predict their potential for spread and impact on the environment, prior to their widespread cultivation or introduction."], "weed risk assessments": ["A decision-making tool designed to identify and prioritize the potential environmental and economic impacts of introducing a new plant species, primarily used as a proactive screening process to assess the likelihood of its establishment, spread, and harm to native ecosystems, agricultural systems, and human society.", "A comprehensive evaluation process used to determine the likelihood of a non-native plant species becoming a pest, outcompeting native species and causing ecological harm, often serving as a crucial step in assessing the safety of introducing new plant species into a region.", "A screening process designed to gauge the potential invasive properties of newly introduced plant species, serving as a critical step in evaluating the potential ecological and economic impact of their large-scale cultivation.", "A comprehensive evaluation process used to predict
