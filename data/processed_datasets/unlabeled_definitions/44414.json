largely displaced by a more resilient and aggressive invasive species in certain habitats, despite once being a dominant inhabitant of its native river systems.", "A small, native freshwater crustacean, native to Ireland, that has been largely displaced from its habitats by an introduced species and has been observed to exhibit aggressive cannibalistic behavior towards its own kind, often falling victim to predators and being outcompeted for resources by its invasive competitor.", "A small, freshwater crustacean, once dominant in specific Irish river systems, but now threatened by the aggressive invasion of a congeneric species, whose ecological pressures have led to a remarkable phenomenon of cannibalism and predation, ultimately resulting in its gradual displacement from its native habitats.", "A type of freshwater amphipod that was once native to certain river systems, characterized by its ability to coexist with other individuals of its own kind, until its population declined in the face of predation and competition from an introduced species."], "gammarid amphipods": ["Aquatic crustaceans characterized by their opportunistic feeding habits, adaptable behavior,

cannibalism, and may engage in predator-prey relationships with conspecifics, characteristically featuring a distinct moult cycle that makes them vulnerable to attacks.", "Freshwater crustaceans that engage in complex interactions, including both competitive and predatory behaviors, in their native and invasive ranges, often displaying unique adaptations to exploit resources and respond to threats.", "These small, freshwater crustaceans have evolved to thrive in complex aquatic ecosystems, where they play a crucial role in shaping the balance of their environment through their unique ability to exhibit both cooperative and competitive behaviors.", "Small, shelled crustaceans that inhabit freshwater environments, exhibiting a unique behavioral strategy involving a delicate balance between competition for resources, intra-specific predation, and inter-specific predation, which can have significant consequences for their ecological dynamics and succession patterns."],
