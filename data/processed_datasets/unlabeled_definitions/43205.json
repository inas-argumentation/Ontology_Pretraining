those with traits that enhance their survival, reproduction, and propagation in that environment, ultimately leading to the proliferation of certain features in a species over time.", "The process by which organisms adapt to their new environmental conditions by altering the expression of their physical and behavioral characteristics, leading to increased fitness and reproductive success, as observed in invasive species that have evolved to thrive in new regions."], "clines": ["The phenomenon where physical or behavioral characteristics of an organism exhibit a systematic pattern of variation, where the frequency and expression of those characteristics gradually shift over a geographical range, reflecting the evolutionary pressures of a new environment and influencing the
