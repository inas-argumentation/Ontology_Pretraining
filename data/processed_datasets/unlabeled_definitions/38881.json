by non-native marine animals, such as oysters, and characterized by distinctive morphological and molecular features.", "A species of marine annelid that is often introduced to new habitats through human activity, particularly through the transportation of non-native bivalve mollusks, and can exhibit similarities in morphology and molecular characteristics with native species, requiring careful identification and study to confirm its exotic status."], "errantia": ["Marine animals that move about independently, often having a tendency to wander or migrate between locations, and are sometimes unwittingly transported by human activities, which can lead to their introduction and establishment in new, non-native habitats.", "A category of invertebrate animals that are characterized by their tendency to wander or migrate, often being swept away by natural or human-induced currents, and thus potentially finding themselves in unexpected and sometimes invasive locations.", "A group of free-moving, long-bodied invertebrates that often thrive in environments where non-native species have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced, frequently colonizing new habitats and potentially disrupting ecological balance.", "A type of invertebrate that, like a nomadic wanderer, is free to roam and move about in search of food and habitat, often traversing long distances to find its next suitable location, a behavior made possible by its ability to withstand various environmental conditions and adapt to new surroundings.", "Organisms that venture away from their usual habitat or feeding grounds, often as a result of human activity, to establish new populations in unfamiliar environments, where they may thrive or adapt in unexpected ways."], "errant polychaetes": ["Worms that venture away from their native habitats, often in response to human activities, to colonize new environments, and may exhibit notable physical and genetic differences as a result of their journey.", "Marine worms that wander freely, often carried by ocean currents or human activity, and are characterized by their ability to colonize new environments and establish themselves in non-native habitats.", "A type of marine invertebrate that wanders freely in search of food or suitable habitats, often arriving at new locations accidentally through human activities, such as the introduction of non-native species.", "Large, free-moving invertebrates that burrow through sediment, often inhabiting coastal regions, and have the ability to thrive in new environments, possibly entering through introduction with other non-native species.", "A type of marine invertebrate that has a wandering or errant lifestyle, often large in size, and is capable of moving considerable distances across the seafloor, likely introduced into new areas through human activities such as aquaculture, thereby altering local ecosystems and potentially competing with native species for resources."], "annelida": ["A phylum of segmented worms that often have a fascinating ability to establish unexpected populations in distant environments, as exemplified by the case of a specific species found to have been introduced with non-native oysters into a French bay.", "A group of segmented, often worm-like animals that burrow, crawl, or swim through the sediment, including some species that may have been accidentally introduced to new habitats through human activities.", "Segmented invertebrates with worm-like bodies, often adapted to life on or in the seafloor, whose members can range in size from small to quite substantial, and which, in some cases, may have unexpected origins and unexpected methods of introduction into new habitats.", "Worms that inhabit a wide
