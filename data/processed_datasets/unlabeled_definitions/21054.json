formation of massive algal blooms.", "A type of algae notorious for its ability to blanket large areas with dense mats of growth, thriving on substrates with complex textures and healthy biofilm communities.", "A certain species of diatom that has a tendency to form massive blooms and is increasingly expanding its habitat, thriving particularly on rough substrates with intact biofilms, which it exploits as a source of food and shelter.", "A type of diatom that thrives on textured surfaces, preferring environments where a dense layer of microorganisms has had time to develop, and is capable of forming massive aggregations that can impact local ecosystems."], "stream": ["A naturally flowing body of moving water that supports a varied array of substrates, hosting a rich diversity of microorganisms and plants that thrive amidst the constant ebb and flow of currents, sedimentary patterns, and environmental fluctuations, ultimately shaping the ecological landscape.", "A natural channel of flowing water that provides a complex matrix of substrates, varying in texture and biofilm composition, where aquatic organisms adapt and thrive.", "A naturally occurring, winding watercourse that supports a dynamic balance of substrate characteristics, biofilm conditions, and species colonization, with varying degrees of roughness and film formation influencing the establishment of certain aquatic communities.", "A dynamic, water-carried pathway through terrain, characterized by a mix of smooth and rough surfaces, where the environment's surface roughness and biological conditioning can influence the establishment of species that form large, colorful aggregations.", "A naturally occurring flow of watercourse featuring a habitat where microorganisms can thrive, characterized by varying levels of substrate complexity and organic matter accumulation, allowing for the proliferation of specific diatom species."], "biofilm": ["A community of
