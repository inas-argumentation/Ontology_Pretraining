inadvertently reduce the risk of transporting non-indigenous species to sensitive regions.", "A type of coating used on vessels to prevent the growth of marine organisms on their hulls, which has been shown to be effective in restricting the diversity of fouling organisms, but its widespread use has raised concerns about the potential ecological impact of invasive species that may be inadvertently
