presence can unintentionally introduce non-native plant species, potentially altering the native vegetation and ecological balance.", "A remote, mountainous region in southeastern Australia, characterized by subalpine landscapes and high-elevation vegetation, which supports a unique array of native plant species, and is frequently traversed by recreational enthusiasts, thereby posing a risk of non-native species establishment and spread through human-mediated activities such as hiking and infrastructure development.", "A remote, high-altitude region characterized by rugged terrain and temperate climate, featuring sparse vegetation and limited accessibility, which allows for the unique blend of human activity and isolation to foster the introduction and proliferation of non-native species into the natural environment.", "A chain of elevated regions, characterized by harsh winters and rugged terrain, where the fragile balance of native flora and fauna is threatened by the introduction of non-native species via recreational activities, such as huts and trails, which can disrupt the delicate ecosystem."], "backcountry huts": ["Remote, rustic dwellings or shelters, often situated in isolated or hard-to-reach areas of mountainous terrain, which serve as gathering points for recreational activities and potentially facilitate the introduction and spread of non-native plant species into surrounding natural environments.", "Seasonal refuge structures situated in remote, high-altitude regions, used by outdoor enthusiasts, which can inadvertently facilitate the introduction and establishment of non-native plant species in native vegetation.", "Rustic, isolated shelters situated in remote, mountainous regions that provide a conduit for the introduction and establishment of non-native plant species into pristine, native ecosystems.", "A type of remote shelter, often found in mountainous regions, that serves as a gathering point for human activity and unwittingly facilitates the introduction and spread of non-native plant species into surrounding native habitats.", "Small, remote shelters or lodges located in inaccessible or hard-to-reach areas, often in mountainous regions, which can inadvertently facilitate the introduction and spread of non-native plant species into fragile ecosystems through human recreational activities."], "alpine vegetation": ["The subpar landscape zone, characterized by low-growing vegetation dominated by non-native species that have adapted to thrive in areas disturbed by recreational activities, often found near isolated structures built for temporary occupation by humans.", "The subcommunity of flora that thrives in regions of rugged terrain, typically characterized by harsh climate conditions, where recreational activities have a heightened potential to introduce and establish non-native plant species, potentially leading to invasive pressure on native vegetation.", "The subnatural,
