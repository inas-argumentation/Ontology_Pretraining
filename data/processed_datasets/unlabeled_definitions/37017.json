more dominant colonizers.", "A species that accompanies an invasive bird species, often without exhibiting noticeable competition or influence on the native bird population's growth or decline.", "A species that spreads to a new region without significantly impacting the populations of native species it encounters, often behaving more like an unobtrusive migrant than a dominant invader."],

significant impact on their populations or habitats.", "A long-distance migrant bird that has adapted to human-altered environments, exhibiting a tendency to colonize new territories and displace native species, yet surprisingly, its introduction does not appear to significantly impact the populations of other bird species that share its habitat.", "A winged migrant with a subtle impact on native bird populations, known for its ability to thrive in diverse environments without disrupting the natural balance.", "A bird species notable for its widespread colonization of a new continent, where its presence does not seem to negatively impact the populations of native bird species that share similar habitats and diets, instead thriving alongside them as a seemingly harmless passenger."], "population change": ["The subtle shift in abundance of a species, measured over time, that can result from various ecological interactions, including the presence or absence of invasive or native species, habitat alterations, or other environmental factors.", "The trend or trajectory in the numbers or abundance of a species within a specific geographic area, which can be measured through long-term surveys or counts, and may indicate a stabilizing, increasing, or decreasing pattern.", "The fluctuation in numbers or density of a species within a specific area or region over a specified period of time, often indicative of ecological balance or disruption.", "A modification of a species' presence in a given area, where the change in abundance or distribution over time is either discernible or imperceptible, potentially influenced by factors such as colonization by invasive species.", "A shift in the abundance or distribution of a species over time, potentially driven by factors such as ecological pressures, habitat modification, or interactions with other species."], "passenger species": ["A species that arrives at a new region without noticeably influencing the populations of co-occurring native species, rather than having a significant impact on the local ecosystem.", "A species that, upon introduction to a new region, spreads rapidly and maintains a significant population, yet does not significantly impact the populations of native species that coexist with it.", "A species that colonizes a new area without significantly impacting the populations of native species, potentially due to the absence of strong competitive pressures or the availability of unsaturated ecological niches.", "A species that occupies a new habitat without disrupting the ecological balance, instead adapting to the existing conditions and possibly even benefiting from the presence of invasive or native species that predominate in that environment, much like a traveler joining an established journey without leaving their own trajectory.", "A species whose presence in a new region or ecosystem is often accompanied by other invasive species, but does not seem to have a significant impact on the populations of native species that coexist with it, instead potentially benefiting from the ecological changes driven by the invasion of other species."], "population trends": ["The aggregate measure of the fluctuation in abundance or presence of a species over a specific period, often reflecting the long-term stability or change in its ecological niche and interactions with other species in its environment.", "The gradual changes in the numerical balance of a set of species, measured over time and reflecting the dynamic interplay between population growth, decline, or stability, ultimately influencing the ecological dynamics of a region.", "The fluctuation in abundance and distribution of a species over a specific period, often reflecting changes in habitat, environmental conditions, and interspecies interactions.", "The measurable changes in the numbers or distribution of a species over a period of time, often indicating shifts in its ecological position or responsiveness to environmental and competitive pressures.", "The change or pattern of occurrence in a group of organisms, measured over time, indicating whether their numbers are increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable."], "driver": ["A species that, through its rapid spread and colonization, exerts a significant and disproportionate influence on the demographics and distribution of other species in its ecological community, often leading to noticeable changes in the population trajectories and community composition.", "A species that, through its invasive

has a significant and detrimental impact on the populations and habitats of other native species, ultimately altering the ecological balance and dynamics of the affected region.", "A species that shapes the dynamics and abundance of other species in its ecosystem, often exerting a significant influence on their populations, distribution, and community structure.", "A force that disrupts the delicate balance of an ecosystem, causing a chain reaction that leads to a decline or significant shift in the population dynamics of native species."], "eurasian collared doves": ["A medium-sized

migratory bird species originating from a vast geographical region, known for its rapid colonization of new habitats and seemingly benign coexistence with native bird species, with evidence suggesting it plays a peripheral rather than dominant role in shaping the ecological dynamics of its adopted range.", "A widespread, introduced bird species that has established a foothold in North America, exhibiting no discernible adverse effects on native dove and pigeon populations, instead behaving more like a benevolent cohabitant than a formidable competitor, thereby blurring the line between
