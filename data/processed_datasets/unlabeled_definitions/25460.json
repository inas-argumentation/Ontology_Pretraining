characterized by periods of heightened activity during the day and reduced activity during the night, which can be influenced by various environmental factors, social interactions, and competing species.", "The pattern of time-dependent behavior exhibited by an organism, characterized by cycles of heightened and diminished activity that coincide with the Earth's daily rotation, and influenced by a complex interplay of environmental factors, interspecific interactions, and internal rhythms.", "The recurring changes in an organism's behavior or movement patterns that occur in response to the daily cycles of light and darkness, influencing its daily routine and interactions with its environment."], "predation risk": ["The likelihood of a species being exposed to potentially detrimental interactions with other organisms, particularly during periods of heightened activity, due to altered behavior or habitat characteristics that increase vulnerability to detection and capture.", "The probability of being targeted and consumed by another organism due to increased visibility or vulnerability resulting from altered behavioral patterns or changes in environmental conditions,

another, more powerful, species that exploits the same ecological niche.", "The vulnerability of a species to potential harm or mortality due to the actions of another species that is exploiting it as a source of food or energy, which can be exacerbated by environmental factors and competitive pressures.", "The heightened susceptibility of a species to being detected and caught by predators due to disruptions in its natural behavior or habitat, resulting in increased exposure to threats of capture or consumption."], "rainbow trout": ["A species of fish known for its ability to outcompete native species for resources, often leading to increased daytime activity and potentially higher predation risks for the native population.", "A species of non-native fish notorious for its ability to disrupt the daily routines of native Atlantic salmon fry, often by engaging in territorial disputes that force the native fish to be more active during the daytime.", "A species of non-native fish
