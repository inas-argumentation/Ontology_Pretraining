{"pigs": ["Feral omnivorous animals of significant ecological impact, capable of introducing abrupt disturbances to native plant communities, facilitating the proliferation of exotic species, and subsequently altering soil chemistry and structure.", "Large, omnivorous mammals that can profoundly alter the composition and structure of ecosystems they invade through their destructive foraging activities, with a propensity to favor the rapid colonization and persistence of non-native plant species.", "Organisms that, through their activities, can profoundly alter the composition and structure of ecosystems by increasing prevailing disturbance regimes, allowing certain plant species to rapidly colonize and persist while others exhibit a slow but steady recovery.", "A type of invasive mammal that, through its presence, disrupts ecosystem balance by increasing disturbance regimes, leading to a rapid recovery of exotic vegetation and a slow rebound of native vegetation, with potential long-term consequences for ecosystem health.", "A highly adaptable, roaming herbivore capable of altering ecosystems through its uncontrolled and widespread feeding activities, often resulting in a preference for exploiting native vegetation over exotic species and altering soil chemistry through its movements and waste deposition."]}
