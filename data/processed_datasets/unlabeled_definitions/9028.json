corner of a vast landmass, characterized by untamed wilderness areas, abundant wildlife, and a fragile ecosystem, where human presence is often subtle yet impactful, and the delicate balance between nature and human activity is constantly being negotiated.", "A vast, sparsely populated region of unspoiled wilderness, characterized by rugged terrain, harsh climate, and limited human impact, yet vulnerable to the introduction of non-native species and the disturbance caused by human activities such as road construction and vehicle traffic, which can lead to the establishment of exotic

through human activity can have unintended and potentially harmful consequences.", "A vast and largely pristine region in the northern hemisphere, characterized by extensive wilderness areas, road

characterized by its ability to thrive in areas with moderate levels of disturbance.", "A species of earthworm that is often found in areas with moderate levels of human activity, suggesting a ability to adapt to a variety of environments, yet remains relatively uncommon and may rely on specific vectors for dispersal.", "A species of earthworm that thrives in areas with a mix of human activity and
