aquatic organisms of various species, characterized by a dynamic balance of individuals, their interactions, and the ecosystem's nutritional state, which can be altered by external factors, leading to changes in the assemblage's structure and composition."], "alien fish": ["Non-native fish species introduced to a specific body of water through human activities, which can cause significant changes to the ecosystem and potentially displace native species, often resulting in unintended consequences for the aquatic food chain and local commercial fishing industries.", "Non-native fish species that, due to human-mediated introduction, have colonized a body of water and potentially displace or compete with native species for resources, thereby altering the native fish community's composition and dynamics.", "A non-native species of fish that has been introduced to a lake or waterbody through human activities, such as intentional or accidental introduction, trade, or transportation, and whose presence poses a threat to the native fish community and ecosystem due to competition for resources, predation, or other ecological interactions.", "Non-indigenous aquatic species that have been
