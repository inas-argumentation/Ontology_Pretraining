seafood delicacy known for its succulent claws and flaky meat, which has thrived in New England's coastal waters alongside a certain invasive crustacean, yet seems to remain unaffected by its presence, despite sharing the same estuarine habitats.", "A large, coastal crustacean species prized for its succulent flesh and valued in commercial fisheries, often inhabiting waters with a mix of sandy and rocky habitats, where it competes with an invasive, green-colored crab species for food and resources.", "A large, estuarine-dwelling crustacean that plays a crucial role in the marine food chain, often thriving in areas where its terrestrial counterparts dare not venture, and occasionally engaging in a game of predator-prey with an invasive yet formidable opponent.", "A large, ecologically significant crustacean native to North American coastal waters, highly prized for its rich, sought-after meat, yet vulnerable to the influence of invasive species that threaten its population and habitats."], "american lobster": ["A prized marine species known for its succulent flesh, commonly found in the coastal waters of the North Atlantic, particularly in areas with rocky substrates and rich marine life, and highly valued by commercial fisheries for its meat.", "A large, crustacean species native to the waters of the northeastern United States, playing a crucial role in the marine ecosystem and commercial fisheries, characterized by its distinctive claws and habitat preference for coastal areas with adequate shelter and food sources.", "A prized, claw-bearing crustacean native to the northeastern United States, known for its impressive size and fighting prowess, with adults serving as apex predators that can effectively deter invasive species and maintain a balance in estuarine ecosystems.", "A marine crustacean species native to the eastern coast of North America, characterized by its distinctive claws and commercial significance in coastal communities, which occupies the coastal zones of estuaries and appears to coexist with a non-native competitor in these ecosystems.", "A large, clawed decapod crustacean native to the waters of the northeastern United States, prized for its succulent flesh and complex, habitat-forming behavior, which can thrive in areas with a mix of warm and cool waters."], "green crab": ["A invasive marine crustacean with a widespread presence in estuaries and coasts, notorious for its ecological impacts, but whose interactions with native decapod species, such as the commercially prized lobster, are still not fully understood.", "A large, invasive crustacean with a documented history of disrupting marine and estuarine ecosystems, often thriving in areas with warmer temperatures and exhibiting a predilection for competition with native species for food and habitat resources.", "A certain species of invasive crustacean known for its ability to thrive in estuarine environments and, despite its own invasive nature, may inadvertently facilitate the growth of a dominant native predator through selective predation on smaller, vulnerable individuals, thereby potentially influencing the ecosystem dynamics.", "A medium-sized, invasive crustacean species with a reputation for outcompeting native marine and estuarine inhabitants, particularly in warm, sheltered waters near the upper reaches of estuaries.", "A species of crab known for its propensity to invade and disrupt native marine and estuarine ecosystems, often demonstrating a preference for warmer waters and having a profound impact
