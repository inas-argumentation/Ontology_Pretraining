at specific hotspots, and disrupt the ecological balance, requiring proactive surveillance and management to prevent environmental harm and economic losses.", "Organisms that are accidentally or

"Species of insects and plant pathogens that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a region through human activities, leading to their establishment and potential spread, causing harm to native ecosystems and potentially threatening human health and agricultural productivity.", "Small, often invasive, organisms that originate from other regions and can cause harm to native ecosystems when introduced to new territories through human activities such as trade, travel, and accidental transportation, ultimately altering the natural balance of the invaded environment."],

understanding of the spread and dynamics of invasive species, human activities, and environmental processes.", "The process of examining and understanding the distribution and arrangement of events or occurrences across a geographic area, involving the analysis of their locations, frequencies, and correlations to identify patterns, trends, and hotspots that can inform strategies for managing and mitigating the impacts of invasive species.", "The examination of the geographical distribution and relationships of individual events or occurrences, such as the locations where non-native forest pests were first discovered, to uncover underlying patterns and trends that can inform our understanding of the mechanisms driving invasions and aid in proactive surveillance and management efforts."], "non-native forest pests": ["Species of insects and plant pathogens that originate from a foreign or exotic source and enter a new geographic area through human-mediated activities, leading to ecological and economic impacts on native forests, and often requiring targeted surveillance and management efforts.", "Organisms that originate from a foreign region and colonize and

ecosystem, which, when introduced through human activity, establish themselves in new environments, often with detrimental effects on native species and ecosystems.", "Species of tiny but troublesome organisms that thrive in forests, spreading from regions outside their natural habitat and causing harm to the local ecosystem through overpopulation, disease, and destruction of native plant species.", "Species of insects or microorganisms that originate from a different geographic region and unexpectedly emerge in a forest ecosystem, potentially causing ecological harm and economic losses, often facilitated by human activities such as trade, travel, and environmental changes."], "plant diseases": ["Pervasive afflictions of forests caused by the unwelcome introduction of novel biological entities, which can be facilitated by human activities and manifest in concentrated areas with higher population densities, roads, and ports.", "The manifestation of foreign agents in a

areas where forest ecosystems are established, with implications for the movement and establishment of non-native pests.", "The condition in which an ecosystem's natural balance and resilience are maintained, characterized by the absence of invasive and non-native species that can disrupt and alter its natural processes, with spatial patterns of discovery points and invasion hotspots reflecting human activities that influence the likelihood and severity of these disruptions.", "The condition of a region's ecological balance, wherein the introduction of foreign organisms is successfully
