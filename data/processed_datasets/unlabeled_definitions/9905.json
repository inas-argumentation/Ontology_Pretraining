plant species increases over time, potentially offsetting the initial advantage the plant gained from being freed from its natural predators.", "The phenomenon by which a plant's vulnerability to

species that initially benefits from a lack of natural predators, allowing it to thrive in its new environment, but eventually faces increased pressure from adapting insect herbivores that ultimately limit its spread and success.", "A plant species that initially benefits from the lack of natural predators in its new environment, but eventually faces a growing array of herbivores as it establishes a stronghold and begins to adapt to its new surroundings.", "A notoriously resilient and adaptable non-native plant species that, initially, thrives in a new environment due to the lack of natural predators, but ultimately faces significant challenges as native herbivores and other environmental factors adapt and respond to its presence, ultimately leading to a decline in its invasive

insect populations, potentially slowing its spread and dominance.", "A non-native plant species that initially thrives in its new environment due to a lack of natural predators, but over time, its success is mitigated by the adaptation of local insect herbivores, leading to a dynamic balance between plant and herbivore populations.", "A highly adaptable and fast-growing tree species, often initially successful in its introduced range due to reduced herbivory pressure, but ultimately facing ecological constraints as native insect populations adapt to the new competitor.", "A deciduous

brought to that region by human activity or natural means, and has begun to establish a self-sustaining population, potentially leading to changes in the local ecosystem.", "A plant species that
