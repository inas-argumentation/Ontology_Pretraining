specific region, serving as a valuable monitoring tool to understand and mitigate the effects of biological invasions on native biodiversity.", "A comprehensive catalog or inventory of a particular type of organism or species found within a specific geographic area, providing information on their presence, distribution, and potential impact on the local ecosystem, and serving as a valuable tool for monitoring and management of invasions and conservation efforts.", "A comprehensive and organized compilation of specific entities, often verified through extensive surveys, that provides a detailed picture of the presence and distribution of introduced or non-native elements within a defined ecosystem, serving as a valuable tool for monitoring and understanding the impacts of biodiversity."], "alien flora": ["A group of non-native plant species that have been introduced to an island ecosystem through human activities, often intentionally for ornamental purposes, and can potentially cause harm to the native biodiversity.", "Plant species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an ecosystem outside their natural range, often resulting from human activities such as trade, tourism, or economic development, and can potentially alter the native plant community dynamics and biodiversity.", "Non-native plant species that are introduced to an island ecosystem through human activities, often for ornamental purposes, and can potentially disrupt the local biodiversity and ecological balance, posing a threat to the natural environment.", "Plant species that are non-native to a region, often introduced by human activity and potentially threatening the native ecosystem, particularly in island ecosystems where biodiversity is high and vulnerable to invasive pressures.", "A category of non-native plant species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a specific geographic region, often as a result of human activities, and can potentially threaten the ecological balance and biodiversity of that area, particularly in island ecosystems where their impact can be amplified."], "naturalized species": ["A species that has adapted to a new environment, often through human activity, and has become established in the wild, interbreeding and producing offspring that are well-suited to their new habitat, without causing significant ecological harm or disruption.", "A non-native species that, through the gradual process of settling and adapting to its new environment, has become self-sustaining and no longer requires ongoing human assistance to survive and reproduce, often thriving alongside native species in an altered ecosystem.", "A species that has adapted to thrive in a new ecosystem, having successfully transitioned from being a non-native introduction to becoming an integral part of the local biota, often exhibiting similar population dynamics and ecological roles to native species, as a result of prolonged exposure to the local environment and lack of effective controls to reverse its spread.", "A population of a non-native species that has adapted to the local environment and is able to persist and thrive over time, often without the need for human intervention, but has not yet spread to the point of becoming a dominant force in the ecosystem.", "A species that has adapted to a new environment, often through intentional or unintentional introduction, and has established a sustainable presence over time, becoming an integral part of the local ecosystem despite not being native to the area."], "naturalised plants": ["Species that have established a persistent presence in an ecosystem, thriving without deliberate human intervention, yet not having become a dominant or harmful component of the native vegetation.", "Species that have established populations in an island ecosystem without human intention, often facilitated by accidental or incidental means, and have adapted to the environment to the point where they coexist with native species, although they may not be as widespread or dominant.", "Plants that have become established and reproduce in a non-native habitat without the need for direct human intervention, often adapting to their new environment over time and often being unintentionally introduced through human activities such as trade, tourism, or migration.", "Plants that have established themselves in a new environment through human-mediated introduction, where they have been able to survive and reproduce over time, often adapting to the local conditions, but may not be able to replace native species.", "Plants that have become established and thrived in a new environment, often through repeated human introductions and reproduction, ultimately integrating into the native ecosystem, albeit without being native to the area."], "mediterranean islands": ["A group of small, landmasses surrounded by a body of water, characterized by high levels of biodiversity and vulnerability to human impact, particularly due to changes in tourism and ornamental purposes, which can lead to an influx of non-native species and shifts in introduction pathways.", "A group of scattered, coastal territories known for their exceptional biodiversity, fragile ecosystems, and high susceptibility to external influences, which have led to a disproportionate impact of invasive species and human activities on their unique biota.", "Regions characterized by exceptional biodiversity and proximity to major economic hubs, which have become increasingly vulnerable to environmental disruption and socio-economic shifts, leading to a surge in non-native species introductions and complex biotic interactions.", "Regions with a high concentration of terrestrial biodiversity that are characterized by a unique combination of geographical isolation, limited human impact, and specific climate conditions, resulting in a heightened sensitivity to external influences and increased vulnerability to invasive species.", "A region of the world characterized by a unique intersection of geographical features, resulting in a high concentration of terrestrial and marine biodiversity, where island ecosystems are particularly susceptible to environmental pressures and human activities, making them vulnerable to ecological disturbances and alterations to their native flora and fauna."], "casual species": ["A species that has inadvertently arrived in a new location, without deliberate intention for establishment or cultivation, often as a byproduct of human activity or globalization, and may not have established a self-sustaining population.", "A plant species that has temporarily taken up residence in an area, likely the result of recent human activity, but has not yet established a sustainable population or shown signs of spreading beyond its initial location.", "Species that have arrived on an island through human activity, but are not yet well-established and have not been able to establish a stable presence, often due to environmental factors or lack of favorable conditions.", "A species whose presence in a particular area is occasionally and usually unintentionally noticed, often as a byproduct of human activities such as tourism or transportation, without demonstrating a significant impact on the local ecosystem.", "A species that has been introduced to a new environment through human activities, but has not yet established a sustainable population or spread beyond a localized area, often relying on occasional and limited dispersal mechanisms, such as accidental transport on human cargo or accidental dispersal from a initial introduction site."]}
