often hosting a unique mix of flora and fauna that have adapted to this specific climate and topography.", "A subtropical belt of the world's oceans characterized by a unique combination of warm waters, rich biodiversity, and a long history of human settlement, often serving as a hub for the spread of non-native species to other regions due to its central geographic location and extensive
