disrupt the delicate balance of ecological interactions and processes within an ecosystem, ultimately affecting the abundance, distribution, and diversity of various organisms and their habitats.",

unintended consequences for the functioning and structure of the affected system.", "The unforeseen cascading consequences that arise from a fundamental disruption in the ecological balance, often resulting from the exploitation of a key species by an invasive force, leading to a ripple effect that alters the intricate relationships within a community, ultimately influencing the populations and

nematodes, can have significant cascading effects on community structure and biodiversity.", "The layer of natural material that accumulates on the surface of land, influenced by the biological and
