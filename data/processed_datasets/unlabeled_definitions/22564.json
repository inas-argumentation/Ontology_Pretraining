dynamic interplay of aquatic life that can exhibit both temporal and spatial variability in response to environmental factors."], "zooplankton composition": ["The mixture of microorganisms and small invertebrates that drift in a body of water, composed of diverse species that thrive in a particular environment and exhibit seasonal fluctuations in abundance, with some species present throughout the year.", "The diversity and proportion of microscopic and macroscopic aquatic organisms that drift through the water column, revealing seasonal fluctuations and distinct spatial patterns, and often consisting of a mixture of native and non-native species that may change over time in response to various environmental factors.", "The assortment of tiny, often microscopic, aquatic organisms, primarily found in water columns, that exhibit varying levels of presence and abundance across different sampling locations and timeframes, influencing the overall community structure and potentially showing seasonal fluctuations.", "The collective representation of the various microscopic and macroscopic organisms found in the water column of a lake or sea, encompassing a wide range of species and life stages, and often exhibiting temporal and spatial variations in their abundance and distribution.", "The aggregation of microscopic and macroscopic marine and freshwater organisms, ranging from tiny crustaceans to jellyfish, that float in the water column, contributing to the ecological balance of their environment."], "adriatic coast": ["A stretch of land that borders a large body of
