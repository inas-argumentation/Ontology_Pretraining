species between the two, while its complex hydrodynamic features pose limits to the dispersion of certain species."], "isolation by distance": ["The observation that the genetic similarities between populations of a species decrease as the distance between them increases, indicating that the exchange of genes is hindered by the natural obstacles and environmental conditions that separate them, thereby limiting the dispersal of individuals and maintaining distinct genetic patterns over long distances.", "The gradual decrease in genetic similarity between two populations as they become geographically farther apart, due to the reduced probability of successful larval dispersal and gene flow between populations separated by increasing distances.", "The gradual decline in genetic similarity between populations as the distance between them increases, often resulting from reduced dispersal and colonization ability, leading to the formation of distinct genetic clusters.", "The phenomenon where genetic similarities or differences among populations of a species tend to increase or decrease in a way that is closely tied to the physical distance separating those populations, reflecting the extent to which environmental factors such as ocean currents, water depth, and coastline morphology influence the ability of individuals to migrate and reproduce.", "The tendency for populations to become genetically distinct as a result of the cumulative effect of geographical distance and water currents on the movement of larvae or dispersing individuals."], "genetic

populations or colonize distant areas, while being influenced by various hydrodynamic conditions that affect their movement and settling patterns.", "The process by which marine species with free-swimming, offspring-like stages (such as plankton) navigate and settle in new locations, determining the degree to which populations are connected and exchanging genetic material across different

natal site, potentially leading to genetic exchange and population connectivity, influenced by environmental factors such as water currents and circulation patterns.", "The process by which
