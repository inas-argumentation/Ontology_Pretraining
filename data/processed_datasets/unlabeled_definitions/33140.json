feathers, or fur, whose introduction into an ecosystem can have significant ecological and economic impacts.", "The group of living organisms characterized by the presence of internal skeletal support, usually in the form of bone or cartilage, and including a wide range of species that have evolved to inhabit diverse environments, often facilitated by human activity and transportation pathways, such as commerce, recreation, and urbanization, which can lead to the disruption of ecosystems and require effective management and regulation to prevent the spread of non-native populations."], "reptiles": ["Species of scaly, cold-blooded vertebrates that have been known to be transported through human-mediated pathways, with some populations becoming established in new regions through introduction by humans, often intentionally or unintentionally, and can potentially cause ecological harm.", "Cold-blooded, scaly creatures that have invaded the southern United States, including Florida, in large numbers, causing concern among scientists and conservationists due to their potential impact on native ecosystems.", "Organisms characterized by dry, scaly skin and often having limbs, that have been known to invade habitats and ecosystems, often as a result of human activity, and can thrive in new environments despite not being native to them.", "Organisms characterized by their scaly skin, cold-blooded metabolism, and adaptation to various terrestrial and aquatic environments, often found in regions with mild to hot climates.", "Cold-blooded,
