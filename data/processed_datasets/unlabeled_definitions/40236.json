{"cold water": ["Temperatures within a range that are less hospitable to warm-water invasive species, particularly those that typically thrive in conditions above 20\u00b0C, but may not necessarily be lethal or even limit their survival, due to the development of overwintering abilities and adaptations that enable them to endure temporary shocks and extended periods of reduced water temperature.", "Temperatures within a range that were previously considered unsuitable for the establishment of certain aquatic species, which have since been proven to be survivable through adaptations such as winter stratification and physiological adjustments.", "Temperatures that may initially seem inhospitable to certain non-native species, yet can inadvertently provide a tolerable environment for them to survive and potentially thrive, unacclimated and unscathed.", "A condition in aquatic ecosystems characterized by a reduced thermocline that makes it more difficult for certain non-native species to thrive, but not necessarily impassable, and may allow for previously assumed cold-tolerant species to adapt and establish themselves.", "The environmental condition where temperatures prevail that

new habitats that may have previously been thought to be inhospitable.", "The ability of certain organisms to adapt and persist through periods of environmental harshness, often relying on unique physiological or ecological strategies that allow them to cope with drastic changes in their surroundings, such as temperature fluctuations, thereby expanding their geographic range and ecological

aquatic environment's ability to moderate temperature fluctuations, allowing them to thrive in areas previously considered inhospitable."], "cold shock": ["A sudden and profound decrease in environmental temperature that forces a species to adapt quickly, allowing it to survive and potentially thrive in previously inhospitable conditions, often accompanied by a reevaluation of its previously assumed temperature limitations.", "A sudden and profound reduction in environmental warmth, leading to a significant and temporary disruption of an organism's physiological processes, ultimately testing its resilience and ability to adapt to conditions that may have previously been deemed inhospitable.", "The sudden and drastic change in ambient environmental temperature that occurs when an aquatic species is transported or introduced to a new habitat during a period of colder water, potentially threatening the survival and adaptability of the species without prior acclimation.", "The sudden and drastic reduction in aquatic temperature that disrupts the physiological processes of an introduced species, previously accustomed to warmer conditions, thereby testing its adaptability and resilience.", "A sudden and abrupt decrease in water temperature that challenges the physiological tolerance of a species, potentially compromising its survival and behavioral
