suppress its growth.", "A troublesome and ubiquitous invasive weed that has evaded effective non-chemical control methods, often relying on chemical means, and is susceptible to management through a combination of biological control and plant competition under specific environmental conditions."], "weed management": ["The systematic practice of influencing the ecological dynamics of a site by introducing controlled perturbations, such as biological agents or competitive plant species, to limit the expansion and impact of invasive species, thereby maintaining a balanced and desirable plant community, while also minimizing environmental and economic damage.", "The holistic practice of mitigating the ecological impact of invasive species by leveraging a combination of natural and cultural processes to reduce their populations and promote the growth of native vegetation, often relying on the strategic application of biological control agents and plant competition to create a balanced ecosystem.", "A strategy that seeks to mitigate the invasive potential of unwanted plant species by harnessing the power of ecological interactions, such as predator-prey relationships and plant competition, in combination with carefully managed environmental conditions.", "The deliberate and comprehensive manipulation of environmental conditions and organism interactions to maintain a balance in ecosystems, often involving the introduction of beneficial agents and the cultivation of desirable vegetation to counteract the proliferation of invasive and destructive plant species.",
