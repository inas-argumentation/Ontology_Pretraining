a plant species, exhibit coordinated changes or consistency across different environmental contexts, reflecting the underlying similarity or variation in the underlying mechanisms governing its growth, development, and adaptation.", "The degree of differences in a collection of characteristics or attributes exhibited by a given plant species, which can be compared and contrasted against the same characteristics of other plant species, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the species' unique characteristics and its ability to adapt to new environments."], "global": ["A scope

encompasses the vast majority of instances of a particular phenomenon or set of phenomena, allowing for a thorough and insightful examination of the characteristics and patterns that arise across diverse contexts and regions."], "naturalized plant": ["A plant species that, having been introduced to a new area, has adapted to its novel environment and is now capable of coexisting with native species, displaying a consistent pattern of functional traits that is similar to its original range, yet exhibits sufficient variability to interact with and shape its new ecosystem.", "A plant that, having been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new area, has adapted and thrived in its novel environment, exhibiting similar trait characteristics as those observed in its native range, without necessarily becoming invasive.", "A plant that, upon introduction to a new region, has adapted to its environment without deliberate human assistance, exhibiting a consistent set of characteristics similar to those found in its native area, and is now considered a part of the local flora, often coexisting with native species without causing significant ecological disruption.", "A plant species that has successfully adapted to and stabilized its population in an introduced environment, exhibiting characteristic traits similar to those found in its native habitat, often to the point of becoming self-sustaining and potentially posing a threat to local ecosystems.", "A non-native plant species that has integrated into its new environment and exhibits characteristic traits similar to those found in its native range, often displaying both increased and decreased values compared to its native form, while demonstrating reduced variability in trait composition compared to that observed between different plant species."], "growth forms": ["A measure of a plant's structural architecture, encompassing its habit, habituation, and physical development, which serves as a proxy for understanding its potential for expansion and adaptation in various environments.", "A plant's architecture, habit, or structural characteristics, which can affect its ability to interact with its environment and colonize new areas, and is often a consideration when evaluating its potential for invasion and spread.", "The way in which a plant's physical structure and architecture, such as leaf shape and stem height, evolve to optimize its chances of survival and reproduction in a given environment, influencing the types of habitats it can occupy and the levels of competition it faces.", "A term used to describe the way plants adapt to their environments, encompassing characteristics such as plant size, shape, and structure, which influence their ability to survive and thrive in different ecosystems and habitats, thereby playing a crucial role in predicting the likelihood of successful plant invasions.", "The inherent morphology and physiological characteristics that determine a plant's size, shape, and structure, which are often consistent across various environments and habitats, influencing its ability to adapt and thrive."], "introduced plant": ["A plant species that has been transported to a novel geographic location, either intentionally or unintentionally, and has adapted to thrive in this new environment, often exhibiting characteristic traits that are similar to, yet distinct from, those displayed in its original range, where its evolutionary history took place.", "A plant species that, upon being brought to a new region, retains its inherent characteristics while adapting to its new environment, often exhibiting both increased and decreased traits compared to its native range, with its within-species trait variation being relatively smaller compared to the variation found between different plant species.", "A non-native organism that has been intentionally or unintentionally transferred to a new geographical area, where it may exhibit characteristics that are similar to those in its original habitat, but also show variations that can affect its success and impact in the new environment.", "A plant species that has been relocated from its original habitat to a new area, often as a result of human activity, and can exhibit a range of traits, both increased and decreased, in its new environment compared to its native range.", "A non-native species of plant that has been intentionally or unintentionally transported to a new geographic area, where it can either establish itself naturally or thrive through human support, often potentially outcompeting native species and disrupting local ecosystems."], "aliens": ["Non-indigenous plant species introduced to a foreign ecosystem, retaining a consistent
