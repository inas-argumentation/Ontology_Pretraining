{"freshwater": ["Water that is not seawater and can be found in bodies that do not constantly interact with the open ocean, whose distribution is susceptible to fluctuations caused by environmental factors such as seasonal changes and climate fluctuations, and whose populations can exhibit vagrancy due to the dispersal of offspring.", "A type of aquatic environment characterized by limited salinity, frequent fluctuations in population sizes, and a delicate balance between habitat variability and species adaptability, which can be disrupted by changes in temperature, water flow, and ocean currents.", "A type of water environment that is influenced by terrestrial processes, exhibits fluctuations in distribution and abundance of aquatic species due to natural climate variability, and is characterized by a unique assemblage of plants and animals that are adapted to its specific hydrological and thermal regimes.", "Waters with relatively constant and moderate temperatures, where the flow is generally predictable and not significantly affected by ocean currents, and where populations exhibit distributions that are subject to regular fluctuations due to seasonal or episodic environmental changes.", "The portion of a terrestrial ecosystem that is neither saltwater nor permanently frozen, characterized by fluctuations in water levels, temperature, and chemistry, and often influenced by periodic changes in weather patterns and seasonal cycles."], "distribution shifts": ["A change in the spatial arrangement of an organism's presence or absence within its natural environment, which may occur suddenly or gradually over time, often in response to external factors such as fluctuations in environmental conditions or changing ecological pressures.", "The unpredictable changes in the spatial and temporal boundaries of an organism's presence, often resulting from subtle variations in environmental conditions, which can be obscured by natural fluctuations in population size and dispersal patterns.", "The alteration in the typical spatial boundaries and patterns of occurrence of a species, often characterized by changes in the frequency, extent, or overlap of its habitats, populations, or individuals, resulting from environmental stimuli, particularly climatic fluctuations, that disrupt the historic spatial arrangement of its ecological presence.", "The temporary or permanent changes in the spatial extent and geographic bounds of a population's natural occurrence, driven by environmental stimuli, which may be masked by natural fluctuations or cyclical patterns in population dynamics.", "The change in the geographic extent or frequency of presence of a species within its normal or typical spatial domain, resulting from subtle changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature, flow, or ocean currents, that may or may not be indicative of larger, more persistent changes."], "fish": ["Organisms characterized by their propensity for vagrancy, whose populations exhibit fluctuating distributions driven by natural environmental fluctuations and potentially influenced by anthropogenic climate change.", "Aquatic organisms characterized by their ability to thrive in various water types, possessing characteristics that allow for adaptation to environmental fluctuations, and displaying complex life cycles that involve migratory patterns or expansions and contractions of population distributions.", "A gelatinous, ectothermic, aquatic animal with a distinctive skeletal structure, exhibiting behaviors influenced by environmental fluctuations and geographic dispersal patterns, often subject to shifting distributional boundaries in response to subtle changes in its ecological niche.", "Organisms that inhabit aquatic environments, exhibiting a range of morphological and physiological adaptations to navigate and thrive in water, subject to fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and other environmental conditions.", "Aquatic, cold-blooded, often-migratory, semi-transparent or camouflaged vertebrates whose body shape and physiology have evolved to thrive in various aquatic environments, from swift-flowing streams to slow-moving estuaries and marine ecosystems."], "marine": ["A domain characterized by constant environmental flux, where populations of species exhibiting wide dispersal patterns are subject to periodic expansion and contraction, making it challenging to define a stable range.", "A type of aquatic ecosystem characterized by a dynamic mix of constant environmental fluctuations and occasional expansions and contractions of population distributions, where changes in temperature, currents, and freshwater flows can influence the dispersal and spatial patterns of organisms with a tendency to exhibit vagrancy.", "An ecosystem characterized by a significant presence of vast, often seasonally fluctuating, populations that display a propensity for distant dispersal, driven by reproductive habits and environmental factors unrelated to climate change, where organisms' boundaries may be defined by irregular movements and expansions.", "The area of ocean that extends from the coastal shorelines to the boundaries of regular offspring dispersal, characterized by fluctuating population distributions influenced by natural environmental cycles and events.", "Areas of ocean that are characterized by the dynamic interplay between the constant flow of species and the erratic fluctuations in environmental conditions, often resulting in a perpetual ebb and flow of populations."]}
