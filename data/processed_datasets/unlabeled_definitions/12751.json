that can hinder its ability to mate and reproduce with other individuals.", "A type of flowering plant that, through its ability to thrive in new environments, has developed a complex relationship between its reproductive strategy and the genetic variation that underlies its colonization success, with certain cytological characteristics influencing its capacity to adapt and outcompete other

individual is diminished when it mates with a closely related partner, leading to a decreased probability of successful fertilization and a diminished ability to produce viable offspring.", "The inability of closely related individuals to produce viable offspring due to the sharing of identical genetic traits, which reduces the chance of successful mating and increases the likelihood of weak

related individuals from successfully producing viable offspring, thereby maintaining genetic diversity within the population and increasing the likelihood of successful adaptation to new

are closely related and share similar characteristics."], "genetic load": ["The accumulation of deleterious genetic variations within a population, which can be influenced by the interactions between genetic factors and environmental pressures, and may manifest as a reduction in fitness or increased susceptibility to extinction, often exacerbated by the consequences of inbreeding and reduced gene flow.", "The accumulation of detrimental allelic combinations within a population, resulting in a reduction of fitness due to reduced cross-compatibility and increased expression of inbreeding depression, ultimately leading to a diminished ability to colonize and thrive in novel environments.", "The accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles in a population, which can hinder its ability
