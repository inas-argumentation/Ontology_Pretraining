germinate and survive.", "A deciduous shrub or small tree that, despite its capacity for reproduction, is hindered from spreading to certain areas due to a complex interplay of ecological factors, including the presence of certain herbivores, environmental conditions, and vegetation structure.", "A non-native plant species whose invasive potential is restrained by a combination of ecological factors, including the absence of effective dispersal mechanisms, predation pressure, and environmental conditions that hinder seedling establishment, but can still thrive in altered habitats with
