survival, behavior, and distribution.", "The presence of excessive organic matter, often resulting from agricultural or urban runoff, that reduces the quality of a waterbody by degrading its habitat and limiting the availability of oxygen, thereby affecting the survival and behavior of aquatic organisms.", "The degradation of aquatic environments by the accumulation of substances or organisms that alter the chemical or biological characteristics, potentially impeding the growth and survival of aquatic organisms, and making them more susceptible to stress and harm.", "The deterioration of a waterbody's quality or clarity due to the accumulation of organic matter, algae, or other pollutants, which can negatively impact the survival and behavior of aquatic organisms."], "respiration": ["The process by which organisms extract essential components from their environment, which is often closely tied to their ability to thrive in a given setting and is frequently influenced by factors such as temperature, water quality, and access to substrates.", "The biological process by which aquatic animals, such as snails, extract oxygen from both water and air, with varying degrees of dependence on each medium, influencing their overall survival, behavior, and distribution in their environment.", "The process by which living organisms extract and utilize essential oxygen, often relying on their proximity to air-water interfaces, which can have a profound impact on their survival, behavior, and habitat preferences.", "The process by which aquatic organisms take in oxygen to sustain life, often supplementing their underwater existence with temporary forays to the surface to replenish their vital signs.", "The process by which organisms convert life-sustaining resources from their environment into energy, often requiring exposure to a specific atmospheric condition that enables the efficient release of metabolic waste products."], "survivorship": ["The proportion of individuals that remain in a population or environment over a specified period of time, influenced by factors such as the availability of essential resources, like air, and the ability to cope with adverse conditions.", "The proportion of an invasive species' population that is able to withstand the physiological limitations imposed by environmental factors, such as temperature and water quality, and adapt to their surroundings to maintain their presence and reproductive capacity.", "The measure of an organism's persistence and ability to endure in a given environment, influenced by its capacity to regulate its respiratory needs and mitigate the effects of adverse factors such as water fouling, temperature fluctuations, and restricted access to vital resources.", "The proportion of a population that persists over a given period of time, often influenced by factors such as access to essential resources, including oxygen, and vulnerable to adverse environmental conditions, temperature fluctuations, and other extrinsic stressors.", "The ability of an organism to persist and thrive in its environment, characterized by its capacity to balance oxygen intake with environmental stressors and optimize its spatial distribution to access essential resources, such as food and refuge."], "apple snail": ["A type of freshwater snail that thrives in warm environments, exhibiting a remarkable ability to adapt to changing aquatic conditions by utilizing aerial respiration, which plays a crucial role in its survival, feeding, and distribution.", "A type of freshwater shellfish that thrives in tropical regions, characterized by its ability to breathe both in and out of water, and tends to congregate near air-exposed surfaces in its habitat, with its survival and activity influenced by factors such as temperature, water quality, and availability of air.", "A semi-aquatic mollusk native to the Americas, known for its ability to thrive in tropical environments and often forming dense populations near surfaces that allow for aerial respiration.", "A freshwater gastropod characterized by its ability to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, often seeking out areas with proximity to air to regulate its respiratory processes, and its presence often having a profound impact on the ecosystem.", "A large, air-breathing freshwater mollusk, often found in tropical and subtropical regions, that is capable of tolerating polluted waters and adapting to varying temperatures, while relying heavily on its ability to surface and exchange gases through its unique respiratory adaptations, which plays a crucial role in its microdistribution and invasion success."], "activity": ["The propensity of an organism to engage in behaviors that are vital to its survival, such as foraging and exploration, which are often influenced by its ability to access and utilize oxygen from its environment.", "The measure of a snail's propensity to engage in essential functions and behaviors, such as foraging and social interaction, which are significantly impacted by its ability to access and utilize aerial oxygen.", "The observable expression of an organism's vital energy, driven by its basic needs and environmental factors, which can be significantly impacted by its ability to access necessary resources such as oxygen and food.", "The state of vigor and dynamism exhibited by a snail, characterized by its ability to move efficiently, search for food, and respond to its environment, which is crucial for its survival and reproductive success.", "The level of vigor and mobility exhibited by an organism, dependent on the balance between its metabolic demands and the availability of essential resources, such as oxygen."]}
