invasive species and altering ecosystem processes.", "The phenomenon by which the unique characteristics of an ecosystem's interior are altered when it comes into contact with a different environmental condition, such as a boundary with a distinct land use or habitat, leading to changes in the composition, structure, and functioning of the ecosystem, often favoring non-native species over native ones.", "The subtle, often far-reaching alterations in ecological conditions and species compositions that occur in proximity to the interface between two dissimilar environments, such as the abrupt transition from native vegetation to exotic grasses, which can have profound impacts on the local biota and ecosystem dynamics.", "A phenomenon where the ecological characteristics of an ecosystem gradually change in a specific zone near its interface with a dissimilar environment, often leading to alterations in plant communities, microclimates, and population dynamics.", "The phenomenon where the environmental conditions and biological processes within a distinct ecological community change or differ significantly as they approach the boundary with a contrasting

are disrupted, often resulting in the displacement of native species and the establishment of non-native ones, particularly at the borders of a remaining habitat patch.", "The disintegration of a homogeneous habitat into smaller, isolated areas, resulting in the displacement of native species and the emergence of invasive ones, which can lead to profound changes in the structure and
