establishment and maintenance of diverse ecosystems.", "Isolated zones of concentrated fertility, sheltered environments, and unique microclimates that can significantly impact the local ecosystem, potentially fostering the growth of certain plant species while hindering others.", "Areas of elevated fertility and unique microclimatic conditions created by the presence of individual trees or small groups of trees in a larger grass-dominated ecosystem, where the trees' canopies and root systems interact with the surrounding vegetation and soil to shape the composition and dynamics of the
