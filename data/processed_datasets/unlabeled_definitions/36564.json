fauna and ecosystem."], "fish stocking": ["The intentional introduction of non-native aquatic species into a river or waterbody to alter its ecological balance, often carried out by humans through various means such as aquaculture, sport angling, or other intentional releases, which can lead to the establishment of invasive populations and have significant impacts on native species and the

consequences, such as the displacement of native species, alteration of food webs, and modification of the ecosystem's overall composition.", "The intentional release of non-native aquatic organisms into a waterbody to augment recreational fishing opportunities or for other purposes, which can have unintended consequences on the ecosystem's native species and communities.", "The intentional placement of non-native aquatic species into a waterbody, often with the goal of supporting recreational fishing activities or augmenting commercial fish populations, which can result in the displacement of native species and alter the ecosystem's natural balance.", "The deliberate introduction of a non-indigenous species into a specific aquatic ecosystem, often with the intention of enhancing recreational fishing opportunities or promoting a commercial fishery, but which can also inadvertently alter the native fish assemblage and potentially lead to ecological disruptions."],

been intentionally or unintentionally transferred from their native habitats to a different region, often through human activities such as fish stocking, aquaculture, or sport fishing, and which can alter the composition of the local fish fauna and potentially threaten native species.", "Aquatic species that have been unintentionally or intentionally introduced into a foreign environment through human activities, and have established a population or are capable of doing so, often resulting in modifications to the native ecosystem and potentially disrupting the balance of the native fauna.",

consequences for the local environment."], "dams": ["Structures that separate and alter the natural flow of waterways, connecting previously isolated habitats and allowing non-native species to
