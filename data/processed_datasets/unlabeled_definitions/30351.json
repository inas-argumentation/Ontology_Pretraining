{"lagomorphs": ["These furry, herbivorous mammals, often intentionally introduced to new environments by humans, can thrive as both native and invasive species, exerting significant ecological impacts that range from positive seed dispersal and prey for predators to negative competition with native fauna and disease transmission.", "Species that, when introduced to a new region, can have a profound impact on local ecosystems, either by serving as a vital food source or by competing with native fauna, and yet, in their native habitats, play a crucial role in seed dispersal and prey-predator dynamics.", "Small, adaptable mammals that have been relocated across the globe, often with significant ecological consequences, serving as both food sources and invasive species, and occupying ecosystems where they didn't previously exist, frequently impacting native fauna and potentially carrying zoonotic diseases.", "Mammals that, by virtue of their prolific spreading habits, have mastered the art of colonization, often becoming ecological influencers in their new habitats, with a dual nature that allows them to be both a delicacy for humans and a menace to native species.", "A group of widely dispersed, adaptable species that have been intentionally relocated across the globe, and have since taken on novel ecological roles, often exhibiting a mix of positive and detrimental impacts on local ecosystems."], "ecosystem effects": ["The cumulative outcome of an organism's activities on the intricate web of relationships within a geographic area, encompassing both positive contributions to native species and potential negative interactions with other inhabitants, as well as consequences for animal and human health, and economic implications, which can impact the stability and resilience of the system.", "The tangible and intangible consequences that a species' presence has on the interactions, populations, and environments within a geographic area, encompassing both positive influences, such as provision of resources or ecological engineering, and negative impacts, like competition and disruption of native dynamics.", "The interconnected and diverse biological and physical processes that occur within a given territory, where the presence or absence of certain species can significantly alter the delicate balance of resources, interactions, and pressures that shape the environment and the organisms that inhabit it, leading to either beneficial or detrimental consequences.", "The influence that a species' presence, whether native or introduced, has on the functioning and balance of its environment, encompassing the web of interactions among organisms and their shared physical space, and extending to consequences for animal and human health, as well as economic and conservation concerns.", "The outcome or repercussions of the presence, interaction, and manipulation of species or organisms within a specific geographic area, resulting from their consumption, competition, predation, dispersal, and other ecological processes, which can positively or negatively impact the environment, human health, and economic activities."], "trophic cascade": ["The subtle and complex interplay between species within an ecosystem, where the actions of a single species can have a ripple effect, influencing the population dynamics and behavior of multiple other species, and ultimately impacting the overall structure and function of the ecosystem.", "A phenomenon where the displacement of native species from their ecological niches by introduced species, resulting in a ripple effect of changes throughout the food web, altering the distribution of energy and resources across multiple trophic levels, with potential consequences for animal and human health, and economic impacts.", "The complex and often unpredictable consequences that arise when a species is introduced to a new ecosystem, leading to a chain of events that can have profound and far-reaching effects on the entire food web, from the simplest organisms to the top predators.", "The reverberation of ecological consequences through the food chain, as the introduction of a non-native species can create a ripple effect, influencing predator-prey dynamics, altering habitats, and potentially having far-reaching impacts on the overall ecosystem balance, much like the effects of the leporids reviewed in this study.", "The far-reaching ecological consequences that arise when a non-native species is introduced to a new ecosystem, altering the delicate balance of relationships between predator and prey, and ultimately affecting the overall health and biodiversity of the invaded environment."], "leporidae": ["The cosmopolitan family of burrowing, seed-dispersing, and ecosystem-engineering mammals that have been globally relocated for human consumption and game purposes, often exhibiting dual roles as native facilitators of ecosystem balance and exotic disruptors of native faunal dynamics.", "A group of omnivorous mammals characterized by their ability to thrive in various environments, often having a profound impact on ecosystems as both providers of resources and invasive species, with some members serving as a source of nutrition for humans and others posing threats to animal and human health.", "The group of rabbit-like animals that, despite their origins, have taken on a remarkable range of ecological roles, from serving as a food source to playing key parts in seed dispersal and ecosystem engineering, and which, when introduced to new areas, can have a significant impact on native species and ecosystems.", "A group of widely distributed, adaptable creatures that have been intentionally and unintentionally translocated to various parts of the world, where they have become integral components of ecosystems, often exercising profound influences on native species and habitats.", "A group of widely distributed, adaptable animals that have been significantly impacted by human activity, exhibiting both positive and negative effects on native ecosystems when introduced beyond their natural ranges."]}
