new presence in a given region, often facilitated by unintentional human activity or natural mechanisms, leading to a potential disruption of the local ecosystem.", "The initial route by which a non-native species is brought into a new environment, often unintentionally, through pathways that facilitate the transfer of individuals or larvae, and potentially contributing to the establishment of a self-sustaining population.", "The process by which a non-native species, previously confined to a specific region, gains access to and colonizes a new geographic area, often through human-mediated activities such as shipping, aquaculture, or deliberate or accidental introduction through human actions, with potential consequences for the invaded ecosystem and its native species.",
