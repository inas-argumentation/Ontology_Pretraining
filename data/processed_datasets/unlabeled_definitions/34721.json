facilitated by human activities such as intentional or accidental introduction through trade, travel, or other means, leading to changes in population demographics and adaptation patterns.", "The process by which an individual organism or its reproductive material traverses significant spatial distances, often facilitated by human activities, to establish a population in a novel or isolated location, resulting in the potential for genetic exchange and adaptation in the new environment.", "The process by which organisms are transported to new locations, often as a result of human activity, and subsequently establish themselves in these areas, ultimately influencing the genetic makeup of the newly formed populations.", "The process by which organisms are able to travel significant distances, often facilitated by human activity, and colonize new areas, potentially disrupting local ecological dynamics and leading to changes in population genetic diversity.", "The
