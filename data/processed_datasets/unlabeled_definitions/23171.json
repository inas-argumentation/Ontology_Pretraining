outcompete native species for resources and potentially harm the ecosystem's integrity.", "Species that have been introduced to an ecosystem through human activity or natural processes, and have the ability to outcompete native species for resources and habitat, often altering the ecosystem's structure and function in the process, with potentially long-term and far-reaching consequences."], "soil
