relying on ancient relationships with the surrounding environment.", "A class of arthropods that thrive in environments with a complex network of underground tunnel systems, where they utilize their unique body structure to navigate and forage for food, often coexisting peacefully with other terrestrial species.", "A group of millipedes that thrive in soil environments, often dominating the local fauna of second-generation pine plantations on cleared land, and are also found in native forests nearby.", "A subterranean group of ancient arthropods that have thrived in undisturbed environments for millions of years, often found in abundance in mature forests and undulating landscapes.", "A distinct group of terrestrial invertebrates that thrives in well-established plantations and native forests, often found in areas where human activities have previously cleared the land."], "plantation forestry": ["The controlled cultivation and maintenance of large areas of land, previously cleared

native biodiversity.", "The cultivation of a large area of land, often previously cleared for agricultural use, to grow a specific crop of trees, with the goal of creating a stable and self-sustaining ecosystem that can also provide economic benefits through timber harvesting and other sustainable land-use practices, potentially allowing native species to thrive within the managed landscape.", "The practice of cultivating a specific type of vegetation on land that was previously cleared or cultivated for human use, often for the purpose of harvesting wood products, which can inadvertently create habitat for native invertebrates and other species that were previously displaced by human activities.", "The deliberate cultivation and management of a specifically designated area for a high-density, uniform stand of a particular species, typically with the aim of commercial harvesting, often undertaken on previously cleared or disturbed land, and potentially benefiting local
