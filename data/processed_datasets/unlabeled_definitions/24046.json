hitching a ride with invasive fish species, exploiting their host's vulnerabilities and exploiting its native habitats.", "A type of parasitic organism that establishes itself in aquatic ecosystems, often as a result of human activity, and relies on a specific intermediate host for its life cycle, threatening the native balance of these ecosystems.", "A type of ectoparasitic entity that forms an intimate connection with its intermediate host, often hitching a ride to new territories through human activities, and subsequently wreaks havoc on native fish populations, particularly those of an

populations and ecosystems.", "Species of microscopic parasites that opportunistically infect fish, particularly eels, often entering new ecosystems through human activities such as aquaculture and ballast water transport.", "A type of parasitic organism that has unwittingly made a home in new waters, often hitching a ride with exotic aquatic species introduced for farming or inadvertently carried across oceans through ballast waters, and which thrives by attaching itself to the flesh of a specific host, such as eels.", "Tiny, unwanted hitchhikers that latch onto unsuspecting hosts, often introduced through human activities like aquaculture or global shipping, and can have significant impacts on native ecosystems."], "anguillicola": ["A type of invasive aquatic parasite that

has been accidentally introduced to new environments through human activity, specifically targeting a particular species of fish with a unique life cycle.", "A parasitic creature that thrives in new environments, often transported through human activities, and attaches itself to a specific host species, having a significant impact on the ecosystem.", "A species of parasitic worm that has adapted to exploit the global aquatic trade, hitching rides with non-native fish species introduced for commercial purposes, and is now thriving in new environments, preying on native eel populations.", "A
