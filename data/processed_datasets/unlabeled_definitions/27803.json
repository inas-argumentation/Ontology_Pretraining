and can be difficult to distinguish from related, non-invasive species based on morphology alone.", "A type of plant that, despite being non-native or native but invasive, causes significant economic and environmental harm by competing with and outcompeting crops, pasturelands, and native ecosystems for resources and space, often necessitating the development of specialized management strategies to mitigate its impact.", "A type of plant species that, due to its invasive growth habits and ability to hybridize with native species, poses significant ecological and economic threats to agricultural industries and natural habitats, requiring specialized management strategies to prevent its spread and minimize its impact.", "A plant species that, despite being intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an environment, is capable of causing economic damage or posing ecological threats to agricultural or natural systems, often due to its rapid reproduction, adaptability, and ability to outcompete native or other non-native species.", "A plant species that has been introduced to a new environment and has adapted to the point where it can cause significant economic or environmental damage, often exhibiting a competitive edge over native species due to its ability to produce a large amount of viable seed and grow in a variety of conditions."], "weeds": ["Species that, although not native to a particular region, can thrive and cause economic damage or ecological disruption due to their similarity in appearance or characteristics to native species, making it challenging to identify and control them through conventional means.", "Non-native, invasive plant species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an ecosystem, often causing significant economic and environmental harm, and can be difficult to identify based on physical characteristics alone.", "Unwanted and invasive plant species that thrive in areas where they are not native, causing economic damage and ecological disruption, and whose identification can be challenging due to their morphological similarities.", "Species of vegetation that, although often unintentionally introduced, can exert significant economic and environmental impacts on agricultural ecosystems and are typically distinguished by their morphological characteristics, but may require additional genetic identification methods to accurately identify and manage their populations.", "Plants that, through their invasive nature, can significantly impact agricultural productivity and
