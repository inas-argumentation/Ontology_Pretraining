sightings in Europe, with habitats favoring a mix of dry and wet climates and proximity to water sources.", "A certain adaptable and resourceful wild animal, often originally from a distant land, has been making waves across the globe by establishing itself in new habitats and outcompeting native species for resources, particularly in regions with temperate climates and access to water bodies.", "A North American carnivore with a propensity to roam free, often originating from captivity, and whose ability to adapt to varied environmental conditions has led to its spread across Europe, where it is considered a problematic invasive species.", "A semi-feral, adaptable carnivorous mammal native to the Americas, characterized by its ability to thrive in diverse environments, often finding refuge near water sources and exploiting opportunities for escape from captivity, thereby expanding its invasive presence globally.", "A large, adaptable carnivorous mammal native to the Americas, notorious for its ability to thrive in a wide range of environments, often exploiting human-provided opportunities to establish breeding populations in distant lands, where it can outcompete native species for resources."], "environmental drivers": ["Factors that shape the suitability of a region for the establishment and growth of an invasive species, influenced by the interactions between the
