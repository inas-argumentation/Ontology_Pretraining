{"uk ports": ["Marine gateways that play a significant role in international trade, serving as interfaces between territorial waters and the global shipping network, where the movement of goods and water between foreign and domestic sources requires careful management to prevent the introduction of non-native species and minimize ecological risks.", "Locations along a body of water where vessels stop to load or unload cargo, and where the discharge of foreign and domestic water from ships can potentially introduce non-native species to the ecosystem.", "A coastal area where ships, cargo, and ballast water converge, requiring monitoring and regulation to prevent the unintentional introduction of invasive species, and where shipping operations data is collected to estimate and mitigate potential environmental risks.", "The coastal regions and harbors along a country's territorial waters where commercial ships and vessels dock, transfer goods, and undertake various maritime operations, thereby playing a crucial role in international trade and potentially introducing non-native species to the local ecosystem.", "Coastal sites where merchant vessels stop to load or unload goods and take on supplies, potentially introducing non-native species into the local ecosystem, and where tracking and understanding the movement of ballast water is crucial for environmental protection."], "non-indigenous species (nis)": ["Organisms of foreign origin that have been accidentally or intentionally introduced into a new environment, potentially threatening the ecological balance and natural resources of that ecosystem, often resulting from human activities such as international shipping and trade.", "Organisms that enter an ecosystem through human activity, often altering the native balance and potentially causing harm to the environment, economy, or human health, and are not naturally found in the affected area or have been absent for a significant period of time.", "A category of biological organisms that are introduced to a new ecosystem through human activity, where they may not have co-evolved with native species and can potentially disrupt the delicate balance of the environment, posing a risk to biodiversity and ecosystem health.", "Species that are unintentionally introduced to a foreign environment through human activity, potentially disrupting the balance of the native ecosystem and causing unforeseen ecological consequences.", "Organisms that are not native to a particular region or ecosystem, potentially introduced through human activities such as shipping, and can have a significant impact on the local environment and biodiversity."], "ballast water discharge": ["The intentional release of liquid cargo residue, resulting from a ship's process of adjusting its buoyancy and stability, into territorial waters, potentially introducing non-indigenous species and posing environmental and ecological risks.", "The process of releasing a volume of water that has been taken on board a vessel for purposes of stability and flotation, which may potentially carry non-native species, and is often discharged into the territorial waters of a country.", "The intentional or unintentional release of a liquid brought on board a ship for the purpose of stabilizing or balancing its weight, often containing species foreign to the waters where it is discharged, and potentially posing risks to the local ecosystem.", "The intentional release of surplus liquid or other substances, often originating from foreign or domestic vessels, into territorial waters, which can potentially introduce non-native species and pose environmental risks, requiring accurate monitoring and management to mitigate adverse impacts.", "The quantity of water intentionally loaded and unloaded by a ship to adjust its weight or stability during or between journeys, which can potentially carry non-indigenous species that may alter the ecological balance of a receiving port's territorial waters."]}
