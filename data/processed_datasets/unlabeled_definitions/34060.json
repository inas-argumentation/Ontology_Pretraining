often overshadowed by the invasive and more effective predators that threaten its ecological niche, while also susceptible to the debilitating effects of certain pathogens.", "A common ladybird species native to the United Kingdom, known for its less efficient predatory behavior and susceptibility to pathogenic infections that can hinder its ability to control insect populations.", "A diminutive yet formidable insect, characterized by its role as a relatively inefficient predator in the face of invasive competition, and vulnerable to the debilitating effects of disease.", "A species of ladybird beetle that, although ecologically outperformed by invasive competitors, possesses inherent traits that enable it to hold its own in the face of adversity, and whose predatory abilities are susceptible to compromise by the presence of certain pathogens."], "functional response": ["The way in which an organism's feeding behavior changes in response to the presence and abundance of its prey, measured through experiments that simulate realistic hunting conditions and can reveal the underlying mechanisms driving this relationship.", "The degree to which an organism's
