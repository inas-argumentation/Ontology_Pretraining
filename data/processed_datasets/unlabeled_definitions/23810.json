only be effectively managed through timely and strategic control measures.", "A type of organism that expands its geographic range within a water body, often causing harm to the native ecosystem and posing a significant threat to the balance of the aquatic environment, necessitating management and control measures to mitigate its impact."], "aquatic invasions": ["The unwanted, rapid dispersal of a non-native organism through a aquatic ecosystem, often with significant environmental, economic, or social consequences.", "The uncontrolled movement and proliferation of non-native species in a

significant ecological and economic disruptions, with potential long-term consequences for the native ecosystem and human activities.", "The sudden and unforeseen influx of a non-native species into a previously pristine aquatic ecosystem, often leading to significant disruptions and changes in the native ecological balance, where the rate of expansion and potential damage can be exacerbated by factors such as habitat suitability, connectivity, and stochastic events."]}
