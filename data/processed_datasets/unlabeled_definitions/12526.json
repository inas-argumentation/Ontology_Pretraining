Americas, yet its origins may be more complex and nuanced than previously thought, with some evidence suggesting it may be an introduced species."], "ecological engineers": ["Organisms that have a profound and lasting impact on their environment, often unintentionally shaping the very ecosystems they inhabit, and whose presence has significant consequences for the distribution, abundance, and interactions of other species, as seen in the case of a specific coastal plant species that has expanded its range across the Americas.", "Organisms that, through their presence and activities, reshuffle the dynamics of their ecosystems, often creating novel habitats, altering disturbance regimes, and modifying nutrient cycling, thereby profoundly influencing the evolution of associated species and ecosystems.", "Organisms that dramatically reshape their environments through their activities, leaving behind lasting impacts on the ecosystems they inhabit, much like a pioneering
