arboreal and terrestrial organisms.", "Spaces within tree trunks or branches that provide shelter and potential nesting sites for specific native fauna, often coveted by introduced pollinators and honey producers.", "Structures or cavities within trees that provide shelter, nesting sites, or food storage for certain species, particularly those with specialized ecological needs, such as cavity-dependent animals.", "A vital, often overlooked component of ecosystems, comprising vacant cavities or sheltered crevices within trees or other vegetation structures, which play a crucial role in providing suitable habitat for various species to nest, roost, and shelter themselves.", "Cavities or recessed areas within tree trunks or branches that serve as shelter and nesting sites for various organisms, often with significance in ecosystems where tree removal has occurred."], "apis melliferra": ["A highly influential and widespread type of invasive insect known for its competitive
