from its native tropical habitat, characterized by its distinctive morphology and genetic distinctness, which can be discerned through molecular analysis.", "A small, exotic terrestrial flatworm with a distinctive appearance, originally native to the Neotropical Region but accidentally introduced to new territories, such as the Iberian Peninsula and Argentina, where its morphological features and mitochondrial DNA sequences provide a means for scientists to identify and study its distribution and potential ecological impact."], "neotropical species": ["A species that has evolved in regions with high levels of biodiversity and warm to hot tropical climates, typically characterized by distinct and isolated morphological and genetic features that set them apart from their temperate and subtropical counterparts.", "A group of organisms that have originated in or are native to a region characterized by a diverse range of ecosystems, from tropical rainforests to temperate grasslands, and have evolved unique morphological and genetic characteristics that set them apart from similar species found in other regions, often being introduced to new areas through human activity or other means.", "A group of organisms that originate from a specific geographical region characterized by diverse and often humid climates, where they have evolved to thrive in environments that feature a mix of tropical and temperate influences, and which are now being found in other areas, often introduced through human activity, where they must adapt to new ecological conditions.", "A species that originates from a region characterized by high levels of species diversity and rapid evolutionary change, often resulting in unique characteristics that set it apart from similar species found in other parts of the world, and is often introduced to new areas through human activity or other means, where it may thrive and establish itself as an invasive species.", "Species originating from the warm and humid regions of Central and South America, characterized by unique characteristics and adaptations to their native habitats, which have been introduced to new territories, such as Europe, potentially through human activities, and can be identified using a combination of morphological and molecular approaches."], "coi gene": ["A region of DNA that serves as a distinctive fingerprint for a species, allowing for rapid identification and confirmation of unknown samples, and is particularly useful for detecting non-native species that have been introduced to new regions.", "A genetic marker responsible for distinguishing species from one another, playing a crucial role in identifying non-native organisms in various ecosystems, particularly in cases where morphological differences are not sufficient to establish their origin.", "A genetic sequence often used in DNA barcode analysis, which plays a crucial role in identifying and distinguishing between species, especially those with similar morphological characteristics, by uncovering subtle variations in their evolutionary history.", "A fundamental component of an organism's mitochondrial DNA, responsible for deciphering the evolutionary history of a species, particularly useful for identifying the origins of newly introduced species and distinguishing between closely related species.", "A genetic marker of exceptional utility in tracing the migratory paths of invasive organisms, providing a crucial tool in the identification of non-native species and the understanding of their ecological impacts."], "neotropical region": ["A vast and diverse geographic area characterized by lush vegetation, warm climates, and rich ecosystems, where non-native land flatworms can thrive, unnoticed, before being discovered in distant regions.", "The tropical and subtropical zones of the Americas, characterized by a region of remarkable biodiversity and a rich heritage of invasive species that have made their way to distant lands through human activity.", "A vast and biodiverse territory, characterized by its lush rainforests, mighty rivers, and varied ecosystems, home to numerous species of land planarians and other organisms that have made their way to new lands through human activity.", "The region characterized by a rich diversity of exotic, terrestrial flatworms, which has recently been extended by the introduction of a species from the Iberian Peninsula.", "The tropical region characterized by high levels of biodiversity and biogeographic connections between Central and South America, known for harboring a variety of endemic species that have been accidentally or intentionally introduced to other parts of the world."], "land planarians": ["Species of flat, slender worms
