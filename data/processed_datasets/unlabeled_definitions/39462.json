{"alpine lakes": ["A type of inland waterbody that is characterized by a unique and isolated ecosystem situated in a high-altitude, mountainous region, where species adapted to a cold and stable climate have evolved in the absence of low-elevation influences, and is now vulnerable to disruptions caused by global warming.", "Freshwater ecosystems situated at high elevations, often characterized by a fragile and distinct community composition that is vulnerable to disruptions caused by changes in environmental conditions.", "High-altitude freshwater ecosystems characterized by steep-sided basins, cold temperatures, and limited biodiversity, which are potentially vulnerable to invasion by species from lower elevations as global temperatures rise.", "High-elevation, mountainous freshwater bodies with isolated aquatic ecosystems that are sensitive to changes in temperature and composition of species due to their geographic and climatic isolation.", "High-altitude freshwater ecosystems characterized by a unique assemblage of species adapted to cooler temperatures and distinct from those found in lower-elevation environments, where the presence of invasive species from warmer regions can have significant impacts on native populations and ecosystem structure."]}
