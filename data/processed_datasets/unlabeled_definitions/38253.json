Lepidoptera communities, leading to changes in community structure and diversity, which are often accompanied by shifts towards more open-forest and forest-steppe guilds.", "The phenomenon of invasive vegetation transforming forest ecosystems into more heterogeneous environments, thereby fostering the coexistence of moth species adapted to open-canopy and understorey habitats, but simultaneously reducing overall species richness and promoting a loss of canopy-herbivorous diversity.", "The competitive phenomenon whereby a non-native invasive vegetation community, characterized by an open and heterogeneous structure, dominates native ecosystems, altering the habitat and ultimately affecting the community composition and diversity of nocturnal insects, particularly Lepidoptera species that rely on native tree canopies.", "The phenomenon where invasive plant species create an altered habitat structure, leading to changes in the community composition of nocturnal Lepidoptera,
