have a significant presence.", "Small, often overlooked, animals that dwell in a layer of decomposing plant matter on the forest floor, where they play a crucial role in the ecosystem's nutrient cycle and food web.", "The collective small animals that inhabit and feed on decomposing organic matter in a forest ecosystem, often characterised by their intricate relationships with the soil's physical and chemical properties.", "Small, often microscopic or sub-millimeter-sized organisms that inhabit and interact with the decaying plant material that covers the forest floor, playing a crucial role in breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients, but whose populations and diversity are increasingly threatened by the burrowing activities of invasive earthworms."], "soil ph": ["The level of acidity or alkalinity in the underground layer of mineral and organic particles, having a profound impact on the structure and functionality of ecosystems, and is influenced by the presence of certain invasive species, such as non-native earthworms.", "The level of acidity in the underground layer of broken-down plant material, which can influence the types of organisms that live in it and affect the overall health of the surrounding ecosystem.", "A measure of the acidity or basicity of the uppermost layer of the earth, reflecting the combination of elements present and their relative proportions, which can have a profound impact on the diversity and abundance of organisms living within it.", "The capacity of a specific type of substrate in forests to support the balance of microbial and invertebrate life, with higher values corresponding to a more conducive environment for the introduction and establishment of invasive species, which can have cascading effects on ecosystem processes and biodiversity.", "The numerical indicator of a forest floor's acidity level, which has been found to play a crucial role in determining the likelihood of invasive earthworms establishing themselves, as shown in a study of northeastern North American forests."], "forest soil": ["The upper layer of terrestrial ecosystem matrix, characterized by organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling processes, which is affected by the presence and absence of specific invertebrate species, such as earthworms, and their interaction with environmental factors like soil pH, road proximity, and moisture levels.", "The complex, organic-rich upper layer of a terrestrial ecosystem where tree roots reside, characterized by a mix of living organisms, decaying plant matter, and microclimates that support a diverse array of fauna, whose delicate balance can be disrupted by human activities and invasive species.", "A layer of terrestrial ecosystem material characterized by complex interactions between decomposing organic matter, microorganisms, and various invertebrates, which play a crucial role in shaping the composition and structure of the underlying terrain, yet is vulnerable to disruptions caused by the introduction of non-native, soil-dwelling organisms that can significantly alter its chemical and biological properties.", "A dense, natural environment's underlayer, characterized by a complex mixture of decomposing organic matter, minerals, and microorganisms, which is intimately connected to the surrounding ecosystem and plays a crucial role in regulating the balance of nutrients, biodiversity, and structural integrity, but whose integrity can be vulnerable to disruptions caused by invasive species and human activities.", "A complex, heterogeneous ecosystem component that can be characterized by the presence of decomposing plant material, microorganisms, and invertebrates, and can be influenced by factors such as human activity, environmental conditions, and invasive species."], "exotic earthworms": ["Non-native soil-dwelling invertebrates that have colonized a region and are now thought to be causing undesirable changes in the local ecosystem, particularly in the decomposition process and biodiversity.", "Earthworms that, originating from outside their natural range, have established non-native populations in
