affecting the native species, with the aim of preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecological balance.", "A method that targets specific non-native fish populations in inland waters, utilizing specially designed equipment to capture and remove them, thereby helping to preserve the native biodiversity and maintain a balanced ecosystem.", "A fishing technique that employs specialized gear and strategies to target specific species or groups of fish, allowing for the efficient removal of unwanted or invasive populations while preserving native and desirable species.", "Techniques aimed at targeting specific, non-native aquatic organisms that threaten local ecological balance, while minimizing harm to native species and the environment, thereby promoting the restoration of healthy fish

unwanted fish populations and restore ecological balance.", "Devices designed to discreetly capture aquatic invaders, allowing for targeted control measures to restore ecological balance in infested waters.", "Structures designed to capture and retain non-native aquatic organisms, thereby mitigating their impact on local ecosystems and fisheries, while allowing native species to thrive.", "A device used to capture aquatic species, typically consisting of a submerged structure with a baited opening or a contained area, designed to trap or entrap invasive fish, thereby facilitating their removal from infested waters.", "A type of aquatic enclosure designed to capture and remove non-native fish species from inland waterways, ensuring the ecological balance and sustainability of the local fish populations."], "fishing traps": ["A device designed to capture non-native aquatic organisms, typically featuring a selective mechanism that increases the catch rate of the targeted species, thereby facilitating the management and mitigation of their invasive impact on local ecosystems.", "A type of specialized, purpose-designed, and strategically placed aquatic device, designed

species, strategically positioned in habitats to contain and eliminate invasive species, thereby preserving the delicate balance of local ecosystems.", "A device designed to capture aquatic invasive species by exploiting their behaviors and habitats, typically used in a targeted and strategic manner to mitigate the environmental and economic impacts of non-native species in inland waters.", "A type of aquatic equipment designed to selectively capture non-native, invasive fish species that inhabit inland water bodies, thereby mitigating the threats they pose to local biodiversity and fisheries productivity."], "invasive fish species": ["Non-native aquatic predators that can outcompete and displace native species, altering the balance of ecosystems and compromising the long-term sustainability of fisheries and biodiversity.", "Species of fish that rapidly colonize and exploit native habitats, outcompeting and predating upon endemic fish species, ultimately leading to significant disruptions to aquatic ecosystems and declines in native biodiversity.", "Aquatic organisms that, through rapid colonization and predatory behavior, irreparably disrupt native ecosystems, threatening local biodiversity and fishery sustainability by displacing native species and altering habitats.", "A type of non-native aquatic organism that enters and thrives in inland waterways, outcompeting and decimating native species through habitat invasion and predatory behaviors, thereby disrupting the ecological balance and posing significant threats to the sustainability of fisheries and aquaculture.", "Species of fish that thrive in foreign aquatic environments, often outcompeting native species for food and habitat, and can cause significant ecological disruption and economic harm to local fisheries and aquaculture industries."]}
