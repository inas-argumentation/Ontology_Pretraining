biological agent, typically a species not native to an ecosystem, takes up residence within another organism, often in a symbiotic relationship characterized by exploitation, and can significantly alter the dynamics and diversity of the invaded ecosystem.", "The process by which a non-native, symbiotic organism, often introduced unintentionally or deliberately, establishes a self-sustaining population in a new environment, exploiting a native host or exploiting a niche previously unoccupied by other species, with potential consequences for the native ecosystem's stability and biodiversity.", "The process by which an organism that attaches itself to or lives within another species, often at the expense of its host's health, gains a foothold in a new ecosystem, potentially disrupting the dynamics of native parasites and hosts, and transforming the invaded community in profound and lasting ways.", "The process by which a species, often originally associated with a specific geographic range, successfully establishes a new and potentially detrimental presence within the territory of a native species or ecosystem, resulting in a complex interplay of interactions between the invasive species, its new host, and pre-existing parasites that can have significant impacts on the invaded ecosystem's structure and function.", "The process by which a foreign biological entity attaches itself to or settles within a native host, with potential impacts on the native ecosystem, particularly when the entity is introduced through human activity, such as transportation or introduction of a non-native species."], "parasite introduction": ["A phenomenon where a species, often introduced to a new geographical area through human activity or natural dispersal, establishes a symbiotic relationship with a native species, altering the dynamics of the invaded ecosystem by facilitating the exchange of biological material or influencing the abundance and distribution of native species.", "The unintentional or intentional introduction of a non-native biological entity to a new geographic area, where it can potentially alter the dynamics of the local ecological community by interacting with native hosts or other invasive species.", "The process by which an organisms' unwanted and typically specific partner, often acquired through direct or indirect contact with the invaded environment, is successfully transferred and establishes a reproductive foothold in a new geographical area, where it may alter the dynamics of native ecological interactions.", "The transfer of a foreign, often unwanted, entity to a new geographic area or ecosystem, which then forms a dependence relationship with a native host species, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of the

successfully colonizes and propagates itself within a new host population, often leading to significant changes in the dynamics of the host-parasite interaction.", "The process by which a species that
