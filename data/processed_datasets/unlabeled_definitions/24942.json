the food web, but also vulnerable to the introduction of non-indigenous invasive species.", "A dynamic coastal zone where the influence of the tides interacts with a river's freshwater input, resulting in a unique environment with varying salinity levels, water flows, and habitat characteristics that support a diverse range of aquatic organisms.", "The coastal zone where the river's influence is still evident, marked by a distinct change in salinity levels and aquatic community structure, characterized by the interaction of freshwater and saltwater species that contribute to a unique ecosystem dynamics."], "pisidium ammicum": ["A freshwater mollusk that thrives in the dynamic environment of estuaries, where it plays a vital role in the ecosystem's nutrient cycle, but is susceptible to decline due to the introduction of non-native species and requires conservation efforts to maintain its population.", "A freshwater mussel species that thrives in tidal areas, where it undergoes rapid growth and production during spring and summer months, playing a vital role in its ecosystem until the arrival of a non-indigenous invasive species disrupts its dominance.", "A small, vital freshwater bivalve that thrives in areas with constant tidal influence, characterized by a life cycle marked by rapid growth in early stages, with individuals persisting for approximately two years and playing a significant role in local food webs.", "A freshwater tidal zone dweller that undergoes continuous growth throughout its life, with faster developmental phases coinciding with spring and summer, and plays a vital role in its ecosystem's food web.", "A small, freshwater-dwelling bivalve mollusk that plays a crucial role in estuarine ecosystems, exhibiting rapid growth rates and high productivity, especially in areas where its presence is not threatened by invasive species."], "river minho estuary": ["A region of frequent tidal mixing between freshwater and brackish water, characterized by the coexistence of abundant indigenous species with non-native invasive species, resulting in altered ecological dynamics and habitat complexity.", "A transitional zone between a river and the sea, characterized by a blend of freshwater and saltwater influences, where a diverse array of aquatic species, including indigenous and non-indigenous species, interact and shape the ecosystem's food web, with the indigenous species playing a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance until the introduction of invasive species disrupts the system.", "A dynamic coastal region where freshwater from a nearby river meets the ocean, characterised by a unique tidal regime and a complex interaction of aquatic species, with a specific bivalve species playing a crucial role in its food web, but facing threats from invasive non-native species.", "A brackish water environment where a river meets the sea, characterized by a dynamic interplay between freshwater and saltwater species, and often featuring a mix of terrestrial and marine organisms.", "A shallow, brackish body of water where a freshwater source converges with the ocean, characterized by a mix of marine and terrestrial species that have adapted to survive in a dynamic environment with fluctuating salinity levels, and where native species are struggling to coexist with invasive non-indigenous species."], "bivalve molluscs": ["Marine or freshwater dwelling molluscs with hinged shells that consist of two parts, characterized by their ability to filter feed and thrive in a wide range of aquatic environments, playing a crucial role in the ecosystem as a vital link in the food web.", "Organisms with two hinged shells, thriving in aquatic environments where water currents and tidal fluctuations shape their habitat, their growth and production influenced by seasonal fluctuations and competition with invasive species.", "Freshwater dwellers with hinged shells, often abundant in aquatic ecosystems, where they play a crucial role in the food web.", "Aquatic shelled animals that inhabit a specific zone where the water's freshwater and saltwater properties are in a state of constant flux, exhibiting a life cycle characterized by continuous growth, with growth rates varying depending on factors such as season and phase of development.", "A type of aquatic animal with a bilateral body plan, characterized by two hinged shells that protect its soft, vulnerable inner organs, and a diet consisting of particulate food sources such as algae, detritus, and microorganisms."], "production": ["The total amount of new biological material generated by a species within a given period, representing the culmination of its growth, metabolic activities, and reproductive processes, which ultimately contribute to the sustenance of the ecosystem.", "The culmination of biomass accumulation and energy transformation that occurs over a specific period, resulting in a quantifiable measure of an ecosystem's productivity and carrying capacity.", "The culmination of biomass accumulation over a specific period, reflecting the sum of growth, mortality, and consumption within a particular ecosystem, and a key indicator of the overall health and stability of that ecosystem.", "The cumulative energy value generated by an organism's biological activity throughout its lifetime, calculated by aggregating individual contributions, such as growth, reproduction, and mortality, which collectively shape the ecological dynamics of a specific environment.", "The total amount of biological material that an organism contributes to its ecosystem over a specified period, calculated by measuring the accumulation of energy-rich tissues resulting from its growth, development, and
