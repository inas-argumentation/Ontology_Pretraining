influencing range expansion are subject to variability and unpredictability, much like the trajectory of a toad's migration through unfamiliar Australian landscapes."], "correlative": ["A method of prediction that relies on established patterns and correlations between variables, often without considering the underlying biological mechanisms, which can lead to a narrow understanding of the
