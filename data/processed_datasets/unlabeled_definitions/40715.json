account both the specific environmental conditions it occupies and the breadth of those conditions across different regions.", "The fundamental ecological concept that refers to the specific set of environmental conditions and resources an organism requires to occupy and thrive in a particular area, which can be thought of as the \"comfort zone\" or \"sweet spot\" where an invasive species can settle and adapt, influencing its potential for spread and success."], "niche equivalency": ["The similarity in the environmental conditions occupied by a species in different regions, reflecting the degree to which its ecological adaptability and preferences remain consistent despite geographical isolation or changes in habitat.", "The degree to which a species' occupation of a particular
