bodies.", "A waterborne disease that can decimate native crustacean populations, caused by a highly contagious and destructive pathogen that spreads rapidly among affected species.", "A waterborne disease that can devastate native crustacean populations and spreads rapidly through the introduction of non-indigenous species, which can be unintentionally carried by human activity or intentionally released into aquatic ecosystems.", "A highly contagious and often devastating aquatic disease that affects crayfish populations, posing a significant threat to the ecological balance of affected water bodies and potentially having far-reaching consequences for native species."], "signal crayfish": ["A non-native, highly invasive decapod crustacean of American origin, notorious for its potential to displace native species and transmit a damaging disease to its peers, often introduced to new water bodies through human activities or unintentional migration from adjacent areas.", "A species of crayfish originating from North America, known for its potential to thrive in new environments, potentially outcompeting native species, and carrying a pathogen that can decimate local crayfish populations, often accidentally or intentionally introduced to new areas by human activity.", "A non-native, invasive crustacean species of American origin, characterized by its ability to displace native populations and potentially spread diseases, often introduced to new waters through intentional or unintentional releases.", "A large, invasive freshwater crustacean native to North
