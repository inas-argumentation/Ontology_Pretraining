over other species in a given ecosystem.", "The specific set of environmental conditions that a plant species is able to exploit during its early growth stages to outcompete or coexist with other species in its surroundings, characterized by a particular combination of factors such as temperature, light, moisture, and nutrient availability that enable it to establish a strong foothold in a given ecosystem."], "dormancy": ["The state in which a plant's reproductive cycles are temporarily suspended, awaiting favorable conditions that allow it to burst forth with rapid and widespread germination, capitalizing on ecological opportunities and potentially paving the way for invasive establishment.", "The state of inactivity or reduced viability in the initial stages of a plant's life cycle, where its developmental potential remains latent until specific environmental cues or conditions are met, allowing it to rapidly transition into a growth phase.", "The period of quiet potential, characterized by a suppressed start, during which a plant can lie dormant, awaiting the right circumstances to break its latent fitness, persistence, and evolutionary momentum, ultimately influencing its ability to outcompete native species and thrive in novel environments.", "The prolonged inactivity or reduced responsiveness of a plant at the beginning of its life cycle, where it delays its growth and development in response to environmental cues, allowing it to better adapt to its surroundings and increase its chances of survival and successful establishment in novel or competitive environments.", "The state in which a plant's germination potential is temporarily suppressed, allowing it to adapt to environmental conditions, thereby increasing its chances of successful establishment and persistence in a novel habitat."], "life history traits": ["The characteristics that dictate a species' ability to successfully transition from seed to establishment, influencing its likelihood of colonizing and thriving in novel environments, and subsequently shaping its capacity to outcompete and displace native species.", "The fundamental characteristics of an organism that govern its ability to thrive in a given environment, influencing its capacity to reproduce, adapt, and establish itself, often evident in the early stages of its life cycle, and playing a critical role in determining its success in colonizing new territories and interacting with its biotic community.", "The set of biological characteristics that determine the pace and pattern of an organism's development, survival, and reproduction in different environments, ultimately influencing its ability to thrive and outcompete others in novel ecosystems.", "The characteristics that govern an organism's initial interactions with its environment, influencing its likelihood of survival, reproduction, and persistence in novel habitats, and which can be exploited by species to outcompete others and dominate their surroundings.", "The fundamental characteristics that determine the initial interactions between a species and its environment, influencing its ability to survive, reproduce, and thrive in various contexts, and ultimately shaping its capacity to spread, adapt, and dominate new territories."], "seedling recruitment": ["The process by which a newly germinated plant, endowed with certain traits that facilitate its early and rapid establishment, outcompetes native species for resources and settles into a new environment, thereby paving the way for its eventual spread and ecological impact.", "The initial stage of a plant's establishment in a novel environment, marked by the successful transition from a dormant state to rapid growth, often characterized by a competitive advantage in exploiting underutilized resources or niches, and potentially influenced by pre-adaptive traits related to early and/or rapid development.", "The initial and crucial stage in the life cycle of a plant, where it leverages optimal conditions to germinate, develop, and establish a strong foothold, allowing it to exploit available niches and resources, outcompete native species, and potentially colonize new territories, thereby influencing community dynamics and ecological processes.", "The process by which plant propagules transition from dormant to active growth, leveraging advantages in timing, speed, and environmental flexibility to establish a foothold in a new ecological context.", "The initial stages of plant colonization, characterized by the rapid and widespread emergence of juvenile plantlets from seed, allowing them to quickly occupy available niches and adapt to their environment through early establishment of a foothold."], "germination cues":
