favoring the survival and establishment of the invader.", "The gradual increase in prevalence of a parasite in the native population, potentially due to the movement of infected invasive species into the native habitat, leading to a reversal of the original parasite community structure.", "The phenomenon where a parasite's population size or diversity increases in a native host species as a result of the introduction of an invasive host species, likely due to the invasive host's ability to facilitate the parasite's dispersal or abundance.", "The gradual spread of a parasite from an invasive species to a native species in a newly colonized area, driven by changes in parasite dynamics that occur during the establishment of the invasive species.", "The process by which a pathogen that was previously kept in check by a native species finds a new, unsuspecting host in the invaded region, thereby gaining a competitive advantage and potentially driving changes in the invaded ecosystem."],

has since altered the dynamics of the ecosystem.", "A species of rodent that serves as a native, long-established resident in its ecological niche, potentially providing a natural reservoir of gastrointestinal parasites that may interact with invasive species.", "A native rodent species that serves as a benchmark for monitoring changes in gastrointestinal helminth assemblages and is susceptible to co-infection by a shared parasite species with an invasive rodent species.", "A species of small rodent, native to certain regions, that serves as a potential prey or competitor for a highly invasive, foreign mouse species in an expanding population, and is often found co-occurring with a specific type of parasitic worm that may influence the dynamics of its own population and that

dynamics, which is now facing a threat of displacement by an exotic invader."], "house mouse": ["A small, adaptable rodent that has the ability to thrive in a wide range of environments and has been known to establish dominance in its invaded territories, often coinciding with significant changes in the composition of gastrointestinal parasite communities.", "A small, adaptable rodent that, through its successful establishment in new territories, can undergo significant changes in its parasitic burden, leading to the coexistence with native species and potentially altering the dynamics of local ecosystems.", "A small, adaptable rodent species widely introduced by human activity, characterized by its ability to rapidly colonize new territories and potentially outcompete native species, often accompanied by dynamic changes in parasitic relationships that may influence its successful range expansion.", "A small, adaptable rodent species that exhibits a remarkable ability to establish itself in new territories, often to the detriment of native fauna, and is accompanied by a dynamic shift in parasitic worm populations that may influence its success in expanding its range.", "A small, adaptable rodent that thrives in environments previously unoccupied by its kind, often arriving with a diverse array of internal parasites that can alter the dynamics of native ecosystems."], "senegal": ["A region where the convergence of invasive species and native parasites unfolds in a complex dance, with temporal patterns in helminth assemblages serving as a barometer

changes in parasite communities and potentially altering the ecological landscape.", "A semi-arid savannah region in West Africa, characterized by the gradual spread of invasive species and the dynamic interplay between parasites and their hosts, marked by changes in helminth assemblages and the struggle for dominance between native and exotic rodent populations.", "A region characterized by a delicate balance between native and exotic species, where the invasion of a previously dominant species can lead to a reshuffling of parasite communities and potentially alter the trajectory of
