resources such as space and time.", "Birds that construct or utilize pre-existing holes or enclosed spaces in vegetation, trees, or other structures as safe and suitable environments for nesting, laying eggs, and raising their young.", "Species of birds that exhibit hole-dwelling behavior, occupying and adapting to enclosed spaces such as tree cavities, rock crevices, or abandoned nests, often characterized by their ability to excavate, modify, and utilize these areas for nesting and breeding purposes.", "Birds that reside in artificially or naturally created holes and hollows, often engaging in complex social interactions and resource competition with other birds of similar habits.", "Species of birds that excavate or occupy existing holes in trees, shrubs, or other structures for the purpose of nesting, often exhibiting complex social interactions and ecological relationships with other bird species and competitors."], "cavity nesting": ["A specific type of nesting behavior characterized by the occupation of enclosed or partially enclosed spaces, such as holes in trees or structures, by birds and other animals, where they build their nests and raise their young, often competing with other species for limited resources.", "The practice of birds building and raising their young in enclosed, man-made or natural spaces, often characterized by a complex interplay between different species competing for limited resources, such as nesting sites, food, and breeding opportunities.", "The process by which birds occupying densely populated, urban environments utilize existing structural features, often excavated or adapted by other organisms, to create cozy, enclosed spaces that provide a safe and secure environment for raising their young, thereby exemplifying a unique form of adaptive, communal breeding strategy.", "A nesting strategy in which certain birds choose to inhabit and raise their young in enclosed, three-dimensional spaces, often created or modified by the birds themselves or other species, which provides a unique combination of shelter, protection, and resource availability.", "A type of avian habitat formation where birds create and occupy enclosures within trees or other structures, often characterized by limited space and resources, leading to complex social interactions and competing interests among species."],
