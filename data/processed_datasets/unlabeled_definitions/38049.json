competition for hidden spaces among inhabitants, with the displacement of some species potentially reshaping the delicate balance of its ecological community.", "A river that serves as a dynamic corridor for aquatic species, where competition for shelter can lead to changes in habitat preference, ultimately influencing the ecological dynamics of its native and non-native inhabitants.", "A watercourse characterized by the coexistence of diverse species, where the presence of certain invasive fish species can alter the dynamics of the environment, leading to changes in the behavior and distribution of native species in search of shelter and suitable habitats.", "A river's tributary that plays a critical role in facilitating the interactions between native and non-native species, shaping the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems and influencing the distribution of sheltering habitats.", "A European river's gentle curve, often a haven for aquatic life, yet increasingly a battleground for competing species seeking refuge from the currents and predators."], "non-native gobiidae": ["A group of aquatic organisms from another region that have been introduced to a new area, often

region and compete with native bottom-dwelling fish for shelter, potentially altering the ecological balance and distribution of native species.", "A type of invasive fish species that originates from outside a river's natural range, competes with native bottom-dwelling species for shelter, and can significantly alter the ecosystem's composition by displacing native species and dominating available hiding places.", "A category of bottom-dwelling fish species that, having been introduced to a new ecosystem, often displace native fish species and alter the local habitat dynamics by competing for
