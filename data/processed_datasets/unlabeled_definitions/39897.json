edible kernels, often found in a wide range of agroecosystems where its vegetative and reproductive stages serve as a battleground for species competing for resource access and survival.", "A staple crop that, when grown in tandem with native insect populations, can become a battleground for competing species, with the introduction of a foreign herbivore often leading to a shift in the delicate balance of ecological relationships, ultimately favoring the dominance of the invasive entity over its indigenous counterparts.", "A type of grain crop characterized by a spiral whorl of leaves, which serves as a dynamic and competitive ecosystem hub, hosting a range of herbivorous insects with varied impacts on its growth and development, and often harboring a delicate balance between invasive and
