throughout the year, particularly influenced by the releases of non-native galliform birds during the late summer.", "The collective mass of all bird populations that occur naturally within the United Kingdom, accounting for annual fluctuations in population sizes driven by factors such as reproductive cycles, mortality rates, and migration patterns, and including a significant portion contributed by non-native species released into the environment.", "The total mass of wild birds, including those native to the region, that are present in a specific area, typically in a given year, with fluctuations driven by natural cycles of reproduction, mortality, and migration.", "The total quantity of living tissue, including both the bodies of individual birds and the collective weight of their eggs, nests, and other biological materials, that comprises the reproductive population of a specific region, typically measured at a particular point in the annual cycle or across an entire year, and influenced by variables such as habitat, food availability, and management practices."], "annual variation in bird biomass": ["The fluctuation in the aggregate mass of a regional bird population that occurs over the course of a year, driven by factors such as changes in reproductive and mortality rates, seasonal migration patterns, and the introduction of non-native species, resulting in periods of varying abundance and dominance among different bird species.", "The fluctuation in the total mass of a region's avifauna over the course of a year, influenced by factors such as seasonal changes in reproduction, mortality, and migration patterns, which can have a significant impact on the overall contribution of non-native species to the ecosystem.", "The fluctuating accumulation of organic matter resulting from the dynamic interactions between a population's life cycle events, spatial distributions, and environmental conditions, which ultimately affects the
