{"stock enhancement": ["The intentional introduction of a species into a natural ecosystem for the purpose of augmenting a population's size or genetic diversity, often with the intention of benefiting a particular industry, such as aquaculture, or ecosystem management.", "The deliberate introduction of non-native individuals to a local population to augment the size or health of a particular species, often with the intention of maintaining a balance or improving the overall ecosystem, but which can sometimes have unintended consequences, such as altering the native biodiversity.", "The deliberate release of a species into a specific environment to increase its population, often with the intention of replenishing native stocks, improving ecosystem balance, or enhancing recreational activities, which can unintentionally introduce non-native species that can disrupt native communities and ecosystems.", "The intentional release of non-native organisms into a natural ecosystem for the purpose of bolstering the population or improving the genetic makeup of a targeted species, often with the intention of enhancing commercial or recreational fishing practices.", "The intentional release of aquatic organisms, often native to another region or continent, into a target body of water with the aim of artificially increasing the local population density, with the potential to alter the native ecosystem's structure and function."], "inland waters": ["A type of body of water that is not directly connected to the open ocean, including freshwater and brackish environments such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, and streams, where aquatic organisms can inhabit and interact with each other and the surrounding ecosystem.", "Bodies of freshwater that are not directly connected to the ocean, which can include natural or artificial environments that support aquatic life and are often altered by human activities.", "Freshwater bodies that are landlocked and separated from the sea, including rivers, lakes, wetlands, and streams, where the aquatic environment is influenced by human activities and is home to a diverse array of flora and fauna that can be impacted by the accidental or intentional introduction of non-native species.", "Freshwater bodies that are not coastal or marine, receiving minimal direct influence from the open ocean, and are home to a diverse array of aquatic life, from tiny invertebrates to fish and other vertebrates, and are often impacted by human activities such as agriculture, aquaculture, and recreational activities, potentially leading to the introduction of non-native species that can alter local ecosystems.", "Freshwater bodies or aquatic systems within a country's territorial area, excluding marine coastlines and estuaries, where human activities can significantly influence the introduction and distribution of non-native species."], "freshwater ecosystems": ["Complex networks of interconnected aquatic and terrestrial environments that are shaped by human activities, supporting a diverse range of species that coexist in a dynamic balance, while also being vulnerable to the unintentional and intentional introduction of non-native organisms.", "The aquatic environments within the terrestrial landscape that support a diverse array of flora and fauna, often shaped by human activities and influenced by the exchange of species, resources, and pressures across geographical boundaries, with complex interactions that can have significant impacts on the native communities and ecosystems.", "Natural areas comprising interconnected water bodies, aquatic habitats, and surrounding landscapes, where a diverse array of organisms coexist and interact, often influenced by human activities and vulnerable to the introduction of non-native species, which can alter the delicate balance and long-term sustainability of these ecosystems.", "Aquatic environments where terrestrial organisms have adapted to survive in a fluid medium, often influenced by human activities, and characterized by a unique assemblage of species that have been introduced or dispersed naturally through migration.", "Ecosystems of still or slowly moving water, characterized by a diverse array of plant and animal life, where human activities can inadvertently or intentionally introduce non-native species, leading to alterations in the community structure and ecosystem functioning."], "pathways": ["The sequences of events, means, or routes through which non-native species enter a region or ecosystem, often mediated by human activities, leading to their establishment and potential impact on native populations.", "The routes or channels through which non-native species enter and spread into a given ecosystem, often facilitated by human activities such as trade, transportation, and intentional or unintentional release, and resulting in the alteration of the native species composition and ecological balance.", "The means by which non-native species are inadvertently or intentionally introduced to a foreign environment, often facilitated by human activities and resulting in changes to the ecosystem.", "The routes or channels through which non-native species are unintentionally or intentionally introduced into a region's freshwater ecosystems, often as a result of human activities or behaviors.", "A set of channels through which non-native species are unintentionally or intentionally introduced into a region's ecosystem, often facilitated by human activities, and which can have significant consequences for the receiving environment."], "fauna": ["The collective term for the diverse range of non-human organisms inhabiting a specific environment or ecosystem, encompassing a vast array of forms, functions, and interactions that shape its ecological dynamics.", "The collective array of living, non-human organisms inhabiting a particular environment, including those intentionally or unintentionally introduced by human activities, which interact with and impact the native ecosystem.", "The collective assembly of living organisms inhabiting a specific geographical area, encompassing a diverse range of species, including those introduced by human activity, which interact and coexist within a delicate ecological balance.", "The diverse array of non-human, mobile life forms that inhabit a specific region, which can either be intentionally or unintentionally transported through human activities, ultimately affecting the ecosystem's natural balance.", "The diverse range of non-human animal life forms inhabiting a specific geographical area or ecosystem, encompassing both aquatic and terrestrial realms, and including organisms that are native or introduced through various human activities."]}
