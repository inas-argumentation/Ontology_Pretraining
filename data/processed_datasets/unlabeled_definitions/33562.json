manipulate vital tissues, often leading to fatal consequences."], "nematode encapsulation": ["The process by which certain microscopic organisms, typically invasive in nature, are walled off and restricted within the internal cavity of an insect host, a phenomenon that plays a critical role in the host's immune response to the invasion, often leading to the demise of the host.", "The process by which invading parasitic organisms, often microscopic in size, are surrounded and contained by the bodily defense mechanisms of their insect host, a crucial step in their life cycle, which can ultimately lead to the demise of the host.", "The process by which an invading organism is walled off by a protective membrane or layer within the host, ultimately leading to its elimination or reduced viability, often in response to a perceived threat or foreign presence.", "The process by which a parasitic, worm-like organism, that has entered the internal cavity of a mosquito larva, is isolated and engulfed by a protective layer of biological material produced by the mosquito's immune system in an effort to eliminate the invader, often resulting in the death of the mosquito larva.", "The biological process by which certain microorganisms, capable of causing harm to insects, are enveloped and neutralized by the insect's own immune response, often resulting in their inability to replicate and cause disease."], "entomopathognic nematodes": ["Microscopic, soil-dwelling organisms that infect and kill certain insects, using a complex strategy involving ingestion and penetration to ultimately induce a fatal physiological response in their hosts.", "Microscopic worm-like parasites that prey on certain insect species, particularly those deemed pests or vectors of disease, by
