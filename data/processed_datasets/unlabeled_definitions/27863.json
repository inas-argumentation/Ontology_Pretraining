resulting from reduced gene flow over time, which can lead to the development of distinct genetic profiles.", "The tendency for genetic differences between populations of a species to increase as a function of their geographic separation, suggesting that genetic drift and migration are responsible for shaping the distribution of genetic variation within the species.", "The phenomenon where the genetic similarity between populations of a species becomes progressively reduced as their geographic distance from each other increases, reflecting the gradual influence of migration and genetic drift on the evolution of distinct population profiles.", "As populations of a species become increasingly separated by geographical barriers, the genetic similarity between them tends to decrease at a rate that is inversely proportional to the distance between them, resulting in a gradual decline in genetic diversity and an increasing distinction between populations.", "The gradual decrease in genetic similarity between populations as their geographic distance increases, resulting from the reduction of gene flow due to physical barriers or other factors, which can lead to the formation of distinct genetic patterns across a population's range."]}
