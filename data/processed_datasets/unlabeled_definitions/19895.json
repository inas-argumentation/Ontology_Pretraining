environmental good or service at the heart of the decision.", "The state of being unsure about one's own judgments on a hypothetical situation, often due to ambiguity about the potential outcomes and the degree to which they align with one's personal values, resulting in a blurred line between the worth of a solution and the perception of the problem's severity.", "The psychological inclination of
