between native species and invasive algal populations.", "A protected area of the ocean where measures are taken to safeguard unique marine ecosystems and their inhabitants from human impact, with the ultimate goal of preserving biodiversity and promoting the long-term sustainability of the marine environment, where species can thrive in their natural habitats without the threat of invasive species, habitat destruction, or overfishing, ultimately maintaining the delicate balance of the underwater ecosystem.", "An isolated coastal area protected from human disturbance, which provides a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of invasive species and their impact on native ecosystems, as well as the adaptations and interactions of endemic species in a relatively undisturbed environment.", "An isolated coastal region set aside to protect the biodiversity of its marine ecosystem, where human activities are regulated or restricted to preserve the delicate balance of its unique assemblages and to mitigate the spread of invasive species, ensuring the long-term health and resilience of its vulnerable habitats and endemic species.", "A protected area of the seafloor, typically created to preserve and conserve marine biodiversity, where human activities that harm the ecosystem are limited or prohibited, thereby allowing sensitive species and habitats to thrive without interference from external threats."], "invasive algae": ["Aquatic plant species that rapidly colonize and dominate an ecosystem, often outcompeting native species and altering the community

outcompeting native species and altering the local environment, potentially causing harm to established biological communities.", "Species of aquatic plants that exhibit rapid spread and colonization of new areas, often outcompeting native species and potentially altering ecosystem dynamics, typically lacking natural predators or competitors in the newly occupied environment, and potentially impacting the biodiversity and stability of the affected ecosystems.", "Aquatic plants that rapidly spread beyond their native range, often causing significant harm to the ecosystem and displacing native species, while also exhibiting the ability to adapt and thrive in a wide range of environments.", "Aquatic plants that establish themselves in an environment through human-mediated or natural introduction, and thereafter exert significant pressure on native species by outcompeting them for resources, altering ecosystem dynamics, and potentially threatening the long-term persistence of the
