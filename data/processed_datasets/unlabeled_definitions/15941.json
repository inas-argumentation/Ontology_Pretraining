it, allowing it to flourish.", "A non-native species' ability to thrive in a new environment is often attributed to its reduced exposure to natural predators and competitors, yet some invaders surprisingly find little relief from their enemy assemblage, and even reap benefits from sharing a similar ecological heritage with the native plants they infest."], "parasitoid species diversity":
