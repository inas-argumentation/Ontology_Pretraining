composition of the community.", "The way in which organisms influence one another's growth, reproduction, and survival through differences in their physical characteristics, habits, and characteristics, leading to outcomes that can favor some over others in a shared environment.", "The process by which plants of different species influence each other's growth, reproduction, and resource allocation, often leading to variations in performance and outcome when grown together, and potentially driven by differences in their fundamental biology, morphology, and adaptations.", "The

specific environmental conditions, resources, and habitats to thrive, which can ultimately influence their capacity to coexist and compete for dominance within an ecosystem.", "The specific
