outcompete native species for resources and establish a dominant presence in the ecosystem.", "A widespread proliferation of a foreign flora due to a relaxation of natural predation pressures, resulting in a dramatic increase in population density and outcompeting native species for resources, ultimately transforming the ecological landscape through altered interactions with a guild of opportunistic seed consumers.", "A phenomenon where a native plant species, vulnerable to generalist herbivory in its original habitat, achieves rapid colonization and outcompetition of native species
