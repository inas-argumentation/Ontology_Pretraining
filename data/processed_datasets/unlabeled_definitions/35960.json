susceptibility to bacterial infections and high mortality rates when infected by certain pathogens.", "A freshwater species of catfish native to Brazil, known for its susceptibility to bacterial infections and high mortality rate in cases of enteric septicemia, which can be transmitted through interspecies contact with exotic invasive fish species.", "A tropical freshwater fish species native to South America, known for its sensitivity to Edwardsiella ictaluri and susceptibility to disease transmission from invasive exotic species."], "interspecies transmission": ["The transmission of a pathogen between different species of fish, facilitating its spread and enabling the infection to jump from one species to another, as evidenced by the contamination of Brazilian catfish by E. ictaluri, a bacterium typically found in invasive exotic fish species.", "The transfer of a pathogen from one species of fish to another, resulting in infection and potentially severe disease manifestations, such as mortality, ascites, and neurological signs.", "The transfer of a pathogen or disease-causing agent from one species of aquatic animals to another, often facilitated by shared environmental and management practices, which can have significant consequences for the affected species and potentially lead to widespread morbidity and mortality.", "The process by which a disease-causing agent, typically originating from one species, adapts and is able to infect and replicate within the tissues of another species, often with serious consequences, thereby illustrating the complexity and interconnectedness of microbial ecology.", "The transfer of a microbial pathogen from one species to another, facilitated by close contact or cohabitation, often with severe consequences for the recipient species, as observed in cases where a fish-borne disease is transmitted between different species, potentially altering the ecological balance and affecting the viability of affected populations."], "edwardsiella ichtaluri": ["A bacterium that causes significant harm to the global fish farming industry, particularly by infecting catfish species and leading to severe health issues, including ascites and neurological signs, resulting in high mortality rates, and can also be transmitted to other fish species.", "A type of bacterial pathogen responsible for a devastating aquatic disease that can transmit across species and devastate fish populations, particularly those of certain species of catfish and other fish introduced from exotic regions.", "A highly virulent and invasive bacterial pathogen capable of causing significant morbidity and mortality in various aquatic species, particularly catfish, through its ability to transmit between species and adapt to new environments.", "A highly infectious bacterial pathogen responsible for causing significant mortality in finfish species, particularly in commercial catfish farming operations, which can be transmitted between species and is often linked to the presence of exotic invasive species.", "A highly virulent and widely distributed pathogen that causes significant mortality and morbidity in various fish species, particularly catfish, by invading the intestines and spreading to other organs, leading to a range of clinical symptoms including ascites and neurological signs."], "pseudoplatytsoma corruscens": ["A type of armored catfish native to Brazil, characterized by its ability to harbor a highly pathogenic bacterium that poses a significant threat to its own survival and potentially that of other fish species, including invasive exotics.", "A type of freshwater fish native to Brazil, commonly farmed and occasionally affected by a bacterial disease that can spread between species, causing significant mortality and clinical signs such as ascites and neurological symptoms.", "A type of freshwater fish native to Brazil, known for its susceptibility to bacterial infections and ability to contract diseases from invasive species, often leading to significant mortality rates.", "A type of Brazilian catfish native to freshwater environments, often found in proximity to exotic invasive species that can potentially transmit deadly bacterial infections.", "A type of freshwater fish native to South America, notorious for its susceptibility to bacterial infections, particularly those caused by a certain strain that has been known to ravage populations in North America, and which can be transmitted through contact with infected exotic species."], "exotic invasive species": ["Non-native aquatic animals that are introduced to a new environment, often through human activities, and thrive at the expense of the native species, potentially causing significant ecological and economic harm.", "Non-native fish species that thrive in an environment where they were not previously present, potentially posing a threat to the ecosystem and native species, including aquaculture industries, as they can serve as reservoirs or vectors for disease-causing pathogens such as Edwardsiella ictaluri.", "Non-native fish species that have established populations in areas where they are not naturally found, and can potentially outcompete native species for resources and habitat, thereby causing harm to local ecosystems and industries, such as
