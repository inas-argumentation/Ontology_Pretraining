They are highly adaptable and can thrive in a wide range of water bodies, from natural lakes and rivers to human-made ponds and reservoirs, where they can sometimes outcompete native species for resources."], "boeckella": ["Tiny, freshwater crustaceans that have adapted to inhabit artificial water bodies, often traveling great distances to colonize new lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, and can displace native species from their natural habitats.", "Tiny, aquatic crustaceans that have adapted to inhabit human-altered environments, often spreading from constructed water bodies into natural ones, and potentially outcompeting native species.", "A type of tiny, aquatic crustacean that thrives in man-made bodies of water, but whose natural range is often restricted to specific geological formations, and whose invasive spread can have significant ecological consequences.", "A genus of aquatic crustaceans, characterized by their adaptability to novel habitats and propensity to disperse and colonize newly created or altered ecosystems, often spreading from constructed water bodies to natural ones and reshaping local distributions and communities.", "A genus of small aquatic crustaceans that exhibit a tendency to thrive in artificially created water environments, often spreading from such settings to colonize and potentially outcompete native species in nearby natural ecosystems."], "palaemonella": ["A type of microscopic, aquatic organism that has adapted to thrive in artificial freshwater environments, exhibiting opportunistic behavior in exploiting novel ecosystems and potentially displacing native species through human-assisted dispersal.", "The process of artificial water body creation can unwittingly provide a highway for the sudden and widespread dispersal of aquatic organisms, often with unforeseen consequences.", "Small, aquatic crustaceans with a history of adapting to altered environments, often exploiting human-made water bodies as conduits for inter- and intracontinental range expansions, while native counterparts may provide a safeguard against invasive incursions.", "A freshwater crustacean species that has adapted to thrive in human-altered aquatic environments, often bypassing natural barriers to distribution and exploiting the ecological changes brought about by lake construction and habitat fragmentation.", "A type of aquatic microorganism that inhabits artificial water bodies and has adapted to exploit new environments by exploiting opportunities provided by human-induced changes in the landscape."]}
