the dynamics of population expansion and the potential for control or management.", "The study of the reproductive and spatial dynamics of cohesive groups of organisms, which often exhibit a tendency towards clonal expansion through a dominant reproductive mode, and where the interplay between genet diversity and patch size plays a crucial role in shaping the invasion dynamics and persistence of

structure characterized by low diversity and patchy expansion.", "The tendency of a plant to produce new individuals from underground stems, resulting in the spread of a single genetic lineage

outward and grows together, forming a dense and sprawling mass, characterized by a bias towards expanding from a central core rather than from random dispersal.", "The process by which a large number of genetically identical individuals arise from a single individual, often through the spread of underground stems or runners, allowing a single dominant entity to rapidly colonize and dominate a

individual units of a population or community, resulting in the emergence of distinct, often homogeneous aggregations that can expand, contract, or persist over time through a mix of reproductive

typically arising from dispersed seeds, colonize a new area or join an existing population, often contributing to the expansion or spread of the species.", "The process by which small, immature plants of a species establish themselves independently of established clonal colonies, through the dispersal of seeds or other reproductive structures, and grow into mature individuals capable of reproducing
