characteristics of the ancestral population.", "A group of distinct, regionally-specific vocalizations used by a species of bird for mating, territorial, or social purposes, which can exhibit unique characteristics and variation in frequency, pitch, and structure, similar to linguistic dialects in human languages, and which can be preserved or evolve separately in different populations.", "Unique patterns of vocalizations that distinguish populations of a species, often resulting from shared cultural experiences and exhibiting regional variation, which can persist over time despite changes in

frequency modulations, and melodic structures that distinguish it from other analogous forms of vocal communication.", "A unique vocalization pattern among a bird population, shaped by cultural transmission and influenced by geographical separation, which exhibits distinct variations in syntax, melody, and repertoire of songs within and among different local groups.", "A distinctive acoustic repertoire of vocalizations shared by a population of songbirds, comprising a unique combination of melodic and rhythmic patterns that distinguish it from other nearby populations, and can be thought of as a local \"accent\" or \"fluency\" that has evolved and persisted over time through cultural transmission.", "A unique set of melodic patterns, characteristic of a specific population or group, developed through repeated imitation and variation among individuals, reflecting the cultural heritage and evolutionary history of a species."], "emberiza citrinella": ["A small, migratory Eurasian
