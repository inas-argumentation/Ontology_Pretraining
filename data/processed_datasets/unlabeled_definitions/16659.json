its potential meals, resulting in a biased allocation of resources towards certain species or size classes, and influencing the overall ecosystem dynamics.", "The capacity of an animal to exercise control over its consumption of food, exhibiting a preference for certain types of prey while avoiding or neglecting others, influencing the ecological dynamics of its environment.", "The tendency of an organism to prioritize the consumption of certain food sources over others, demonstrating varying degrees of precision and specialization in its foraging behavior, which can have significant implications for the dynamics of an ecosystem.", "The degree to which a species demonstrates a preferential targeting of certain prey individuals or species, despite having the capacity to consume a wide range of available food sources, thereby influencing the dynamics of its ecological niche.", "The tendency of an invasive species to exhibit a feeding behavior that is less discriminatory and more opportunistic, allowing it to consume a broader range of prey items, thereby potentially disrupting the ecological balance and increasing its impact on native species."], "functional response": ["The quantifiable measure of an organism's feeding activity in response to its environmental surroundings, encompassing the rate at which it consumes its preferred and opportunistic prey in relation to their availability, as well as its capacity to adapt its eating habits in pursuit of optimal nutritional gain.", "The rate at which an organism exploits its food resources, reflecting its ability to adapt and thrive in its environment, influenced by the specific characteristics of the prey species and the ecological context in which it operates.", "The manner in which a species' feeding behavior responds to changes in the abundance of its prey, revealing insights into its ecological role and potential impact on its environment.", "The way in which an organism adjusts its feeding behavior to respond to changes in the availability of its preferred food sources, revealing its capacity to capture, consume, and manage its resources in its environment.", "The way in which an animal's feeding behavior changes in response to the availability of its prey, reflecting its efficiency in capturing and consuming its food source, which can have significant effects on the ecological dynamics of an environment."], "killer shrimp": ["A voracious, opportunistic crustacean predator that excels at devouring a wide variety of prey, leaving a trail of ecological destruction

the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems, particularly in European waterways.", "A widely distributed, native freshwater crustacean species that, while adapted to certain ecological niches, is now increasingly vulnerable to competition and predation by invasive species with altered feeding habits and functional responses.", "A small, native freshwater crustacean that plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance, but may struggle to coexist with a highly efficient and opportunistic invader that has no qualms about devouring a wide variety of prey, often leaving a trail of devastation in its wake.", "A type of freshwater crustacean known for its typical predatory behavior and conservative feeding habits, which, when compared to certain invasive species, tend to exhibit lower maximum feeding rates and more discerning prey selection."], "gammarid": ["A freshwater crustacean with a penchant for voracious appetites and adaptable feeding habits, capable of exerting a
