and potentially displace native species."], "marinas": ["Coastal areas with concentrated human activity and infrastructure, often featuring multiple slips and docks for watercraft, where exotic species can potentially hitchhike via human-mediated transport.", "A gathering point for ocean-going vessels, serving as a hub for exchange, where species from distant locales can potentially hitchhike their way into new environments, facilitated by the movement of marine cargo and human activity.", "A hub of human activity where freshwater and saltwater environments converge, facilitating the exchange of species between natural ecosystems and human-mediated transportation networks.", "Areas where commercial vessels regularly dock, harboring a concentrated microcosm of aquatic life,

region, facilitated by a combination of natural and human-mediated factors, ultimately leading to its proliferation and integration into the local ecosystem.", "The process by which non-native organisms, often introduced through human activities, establish and spread populations in new environments, facilitated by their ability to disperse and adapt to changing ecological conditions.", "The process by which a species' ability to colonize new areas is facilitated by its capacity to spread from one location to another, often through human-mediated means, and ultimately results in the establishment of a self-sustaining population in a novel habitat.", "The sequence of events that facilitates the unintended transfer of species from their native habitat to a new region, often accompanied by the subsequent establishment and proliferation of the introduced species in its new environment."], "crustaceans": ["Small, often tiny, marine creatures that thrive in coastal areas,
