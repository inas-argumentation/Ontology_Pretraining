in large numbers and feeding on the inner bark of trees.", "Tiny, typically wood-dwelling insects that excavate tunnels beneath the protective outer layer of certain plants, often exploiting the tree's vascular system for food and shelter, and whose recent appearances in North America have sparked interest in understanding the rapid spread of foreign species from Eastern Asia.", "Small, oval-shaped insects that are notoriously successful at traversing vast distances, often by human unwittingly facilitated means, to colonize new territories and infest native tree species, where they excavate intricate networks of tunnels to nurture their symbiotic fungal counterparts.", "Small, typically wood-boring insects that burrow into tree bark to excavate and cultivate fungi, facilitating a symbiotic relationship that provides them with nutrients.", "Small, wood-boring beetles that often introduce foreign fungal symbionts into their host trees, typically gaining access through natural openings like cracks or scars, and can cause significant damage and even mortality to these trees."], "coleoptera": ["The order of beetles that comprises a wide range of insect species, from those with highly specialized adaptations for invading and exploiting forest ecosystems, to those that have adapted to inhabit human-dominated landscapes and even structures, characterized by distinctive morphological features and complex interactions with their environments.", "Beetles of a particular order, commonly found in a wide range of habitats, but recently some species have been introduced to new regions, such as eastern North America, through human activity, where they coexist with native species, often causing ecological disruption.", "The beetles that are infamous for their role as unwitting architects of chaos, silently infiltrating the native ecosystems of North America, bringing with them a trail of destruction in the form of newly detected, exotic species.", "The group of insects that typically feature hardened, usually translucent, forewings and soft, membranous hindwings, often adapted to excavate and tunnel into wood and other plant materials, with recent discoveries revealing an influx of invasive species from eastern Asia to eastern North America.", "Beetles of the order that includes insects renowned for their ability to tunnel into plant tissues, often introducing foreign microorganisms that can cause harm to native ecosystems, are frequently transported across vast distances and can establish themselves in new environments."], "ambrosia beetles": ["Tiny, insectivorous beetles that inhabit the moist, nutrient-rich tissues of certain plants, often forming intimate relationships with fungi to cultivate their food source, and have

remarkable ability to spread and colonize new territories, often originating from distant regions and posing a threat to local ecosystems.", "Small, wood-boring beetles that are transported across vast distances, often unwittingly by human activity, and are increasingly introduced to new regions, where they can establish non-native populations and pose ecological risks to local forests and ecosystems.", "Small, intricately designed beetles that feed on the nutrient-rich sap of various tree species, particularly those native to Eastern North America, and have recently become notable for their increasing presence and geographical dispersal from their original Asian habitats.", "Tiny, secretive beetles known for their peculiar habit of harvesting fungal allies to supplement their diet,
