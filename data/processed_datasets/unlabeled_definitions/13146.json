introduced and spread through human activity, specifically by vehicles, and have adapted to grow in environments different from their native habitats, often causing changes to the local ecosystem.", "Non-native plant species that have entered an ecosystem through human activity, such as transportation corridors, and have established a population in a new region, often with the potential to outcompete native species for resources and alter the local vegetation composition.", "Non-native plant species that have been inadvertently or intentionally transported to a new region through human activities, such as vehicular traffic, and have established themselves in the wild, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and habitat.", "Species of flora that have been unintentionally introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, often originating from distant regions, and which can displace native vegetation and alter the local biodiversity."], "road verges": ["The border regions along highways and secondary routes where the natural environment and human infrastructure converge, characterized by a unique assemblage of flora and fauna influenced by the flow

species that are often introduced, facilitated, or augmented by human activities, particularly in urban areas.", "The strip of land alongside a linear transportation route, characterized by a unique set of environmental conditions influenced by the movement of vehicles and the proximity to urban areas, supporting a diverse range of plant species, some of which are non-native to the local ecosystem.", "A transitional zone adjacent to transportation corridors, often characterized by altered habitat conditions and increased propagule dispersal, where native and non-native plant species coexist and compete for space.", "Areas adjacent to thoroughfares, where native and non-native plant species can interact with traffic and urbanization factors, influencing local ecosystems."], "alien plant invasion": ["The unauthorized and often unintentional introduction and establishment of non-native plant species in a particular ecosystem, typically facilitated by human activities such as transportation and urbanization, leading to changes in the native vegetation and potential ecological disruptions.", "The dispersal and establishment of non-native flora, often facilitated by human activities, such as transportation networks, which can alter native ecosystems and potentially outcompete indigenous species for resources, leading to changes in local biodiversity.", "The uncontrolled introduction and spread of non-native plant species, facilitated by human activities and environmental factors, resulting in alterations to native ecosystems and potential disruptions to biodiversity and ecosystem services.", "The unintended and unwanted spread of non-native plant species through human-mediated vectors, such as transportation routes, which can alter the ecological integrity of affected areas by outcompeting native species and disrupting ecosystem functioning.", "The uncontrolled spread of non-native plant species to a particular region or ecosystem, often facilitated by human activities such as transportation and urbanization, which can alter native vegetation composition and potentially outcompete native species for resources."], "urbanization": ["The process by which human activity transforms natural or rural areas into zones characterized by increased vehicular traffic, modified habitats, and the influx of non-native species, often driven by changes in land use and demographic shifts.", "The process by which the natural habitats and ecosystems of a region are increasingly dominated by the presence of human settlements, infrastructure, and activities, leading to the transformation of native environments and the introduction of non-native species through vehicular traffic and other pathways.", "The gradual transformation of natural environments into human-dominated ecosystems characterized by the proliferation of anthropogenic activities, infrastructure, and settlements, which can lead to the facilitation of non-native species introduction and spread through transportation routes and altered habitat conditions.", "The gradual transformation of natural or agricultural landscapes into dense populations and concentrated built
