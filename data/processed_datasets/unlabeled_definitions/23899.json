{"a priori inference": ["The process of making predictions about a phenomenon based on a set of assumptions or hypotheses that are drawn from a deep understanding of the underlying ecological mechanisms, allowing for the development of testable theories and the quantification of relationships between variables.", "The scientific process of using prior knowledge and expectations to guide the investigation of complex phenomena, and then evaluating the extent to which observed patterns conform to these hypotheses, thereby informing the understanding of underlying mechanisms driving ecological invasions.", "The process of evaluating hypotheses about environmental factors that influence the distribution of an invasive species by statistically analyzing patterns in their presence or absence across a specific region, with the aim of understanding the underlying mechanisms driving the species' spread.", "The process of using predefined, preconceived notions or expectations to identify patterns and relationships in data, often by testing these hypotheses against empirical evidence to validate or refute them.", "The process of making informed predictions about the underlying patterns and relationships between environmental factors and species distribution, prior to analyzing the data, by leveraging existing knowledge and hypotheses about the species' behavior and ecology."], "landscape composition": ["The underlying configuration of spatially interconnected features that affect the distribution and dynamics of species, taking into account the complex interplay between environmental and anthropogenic factors that shape the distribution of an invasive species.", "The arrangement and characteristics of environmental features and human activities within a geographic area, which influence the distribution and abundance of species and can play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of invasive species' spread.", "The arrangement and configuration of environmental and anthropogenic features within a specific area, which can impact the distribution and behavior of invasive species, in this case the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii.", "The arrangement and combination of various natural and human-made features within a geographic area, such as wetlands, forests, and human settlements, which influence the distribution and behavior of species.", "The underlying arrangement and configuration of environmental features, including both abiotic and biotic components, that collectively influence the presence, distribution, and movement of species within a given area."], "habitat selection": ["The process by which a species navigates and settles in environments that provide optimal conditions for survival and reproduction, often exhibiting a preference for certain topographical, hydrological, or land-use characteristics that facilitate dispersal and population persistence.", "The process by which an invasive species settles in areas with specific environmental conditions that provide the necessary resources and shelter for its survival and dispersal, ultimately influencing the species' distribution pattern.", "The process by which a species chooses a specific spatial arrangement of environmental factors, such as permanent water bodies and human-dominated landscapes, that favor its survival and reproduction, resulting in a non-random distribution across its range.", "The process by which an invasive species chooses optimal environmental conditions and landscape features, such as permanent wetlands, human-dominated areas, and connectivity, to colonize and thrive in a new ecosystem, often driven by its dispersal ability and adaptability.", "The process by which an invasive species determines its suitability for colonization and establishment in a particular environment, often guided by specific abiotic and biotic features that facilitate its dispersal, growth, and survival."], "isolation": ["The limitation of a species' spread due to barriers or unoccupied habitats, resulting in the formation of isolated \"pockets\" of populations, which can contribute to the development of spatial patterns in its distribution.", "The physical and ecological constraints that limit the connectivity and dispersal of an invasive species, thereby creating a boundary beyond which the species is unlikely to successfully establish a breeding population.", "The absence of a species' spatial influence, where the boundaries of its occurrence seem disconnected, yet potentially still susceptible to invasion through long-distance dispersal or other external forces, which can ultimately lead to changes in its distribution pattern.", "The reduced likelihood of encountering a species due to the presence of certain environmental barriers or modifications, which can hinder its ability to colonize or expand its range.", "The condition where environmental characteristics or human activities create barriers or limitations that hinder the spread of a species, resulting in a fragmented distribution pattern."]}
