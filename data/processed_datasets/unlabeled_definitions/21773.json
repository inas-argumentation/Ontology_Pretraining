{"growth rates": ["The measure of an organism's increase in size or development over a given period of time, reflecting its ability to adapt and thrive in its environment, which is crucial for understanding its response to changes and interactions with other species.", "The measure of the intensity of physiological processes that enable a species to adapt to its environment and increase its physical attributes, such as body size, over time, which can be influenced by factors like biotic interactions, resource availability, and environmental conditions.", "The pace at which juvenile crustaceans of the same species increase in size and mass in response to various environmental factors, such as density and competition with other species.", "The increase in size or mass of an individual over time, often influenced by environmental factors and interspecies interactions, ultimately determining the survival and fitness of a species.", "The rate at which organisms can adjust their physical characteristics or biomass to adapt to changing environmental conditions or to compete for resources, as reflected in the development and maturation of juvenile crayfish."]}
