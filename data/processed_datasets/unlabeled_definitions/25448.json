through the Gibraltar Strait, which has historically facilitated their colonization and establishment in this unique ecosystem."], "gibraltar strait": ["A narrow and historically significant waterway connecting two larger bodies of water, which has been instrumental in facilitating the migration of aquatic species over millions of years, while also presenting a biological obstacle for some organisms.", "A natural passage connecting two major bodies of water, which has played a significant role in the historical dispersal of marine species between them, and its unique physical characteristics, such as depth and circulation patterns, have been found to influence the success of species colonizing one of the bodies.", "The narrow passage connecting the two ancient bodies of water that has long played a significant role in the transfer of biological diversity, serving as a natural corridor for species to migrate and colonize new regions, with the depth of the passage posing a physical barrier to species with limited tolerance for shallow waters.", "The narrow passage between two continents that has played a crucial role in shaping the ecosystem of a major body of water, allowing certain marine species to migrate and thrive on the other side, while also posing a significant obstacle to their colonization efforts.", "The narrow passage separating two bodies of water, characterized by its significance as a barrier to species migration, particularly for marine organisms, due to its depth limitations and potential impact on local ecosystem dynamics."], "ecological determinants": ["The intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence the likelihood and success of a species' establishment in a new environment, encompassing the complex interplay between the species' biology, ecological adaptations, and environmental conditions.", "The underlying factors that dictate the success or failure of species to establish themselves in a new environment, influenced by both the characteristics of the species themselves and the physical and biological properties of the environment they are attempting to inhabit.", "The characteristics and factors that influence the ability of a species to establish a new population in a previously unoccupied area, often determined by the interaction between the species' biology and the environmental conditions of the new habitat.", "The environmental and biological characteristics that influence the likelihood of a species to successfully establish and thrive in a new geographic region, often determining which locations are more conducive to colonization and invasion.", "The intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence the likelihood of a species' establishment and spread in a new environment, such as water depth, currents, productivity, and the intensity of scientific exploration."], "life history": ["The unique combination of characteristics, traits, and adaptations that dictate a species' suitability to thrive in a particular environment, including factors such as body size, reproduction habits, and depth tolerance, which influence its ability to successfully establish and colonize new territories.", "The complex interaction between an organism's developmental, reproductive, and physiological characteristics, which shape its probability of survival, growth, and expansion in a given environment.", "The trajectory of a species' ecological journey, shaped by its unique characteristics and interactions with its environment, from birth to potential long-term establishment, involving adaptations that facilitate its spread and persistence in new habitats.", "The characteristic patterns of an organism's growth, development, and reproduction, which determine its likelihood of successfully establishing itself in a new environment, are shaped by its evolutionary adaptations and play a crucial role in influencing its chances of becoming invasive.", "The inherent and evolving characteristics that shape the manner in which an organism adapts, survives, and reproduces within its environment, often playing a crucial role in determining its success or failure in colonizing new territories."], "propagules": ["Dispersive units of living matter that carry a species' genetic information, often produced by an individual organism, which can establish new populations in a different region, potentially influencing the dynamics of a ecosystem.", "Small units of biological dispersal, often comprising reproductive structures or juvenile forms, that enable species to establish new populations or spread across environments, frequently influenced by factors such as water circulation and habitat depth.", "Small, often reproductive, packages of biological material that can potentially give rise to new populations, which play a crucial role in the colonization success of species, particularly in aquatic environments where they can hitch a ride across natural barriers such as straits.", "The reproductive units of a species, often dispersing through water or air, that play a crucial role in the initial establishment of a new population in a novel environment, such as a sea or ocean, where they must navigate through physical barriers, competition, and predation to successfully colonize.", "The dispersal units of a species that can independently propagate its presence in a new environment, often containing essential genetic material for survival and reproduction."], "colonization success": ["The extent to which a non-native species is able to establish a viable population in a new geographical region, characterized by its ability to adapt to the local environmental conditions and ultimately become a persistent component of the native ecosystem.", "The process by which a non-native species is able to establish and maintain a population in a new geographic area, often as a result of factors such as habitat suitability, ecological niches, and environmental conditions, which enable the species to thrive and spread.", "The extent to which an alien species is able to establish a self-sustaining population in a new region, often contingent upon its ability to adapt to and exploit existing environmental conditions, overcoming biotic and abiotic barriers to occupancy.", "The successful establishment of a non-native species in a new habitat, measured by its ability to thrive, reproduce, and spread across the environment, despite initial barriers or challenges.", "The establishment of a species in a new environment, measured by its ability to maintain a viable population over time and expand its range, often determined by the interaction between the species' biological and ecological characteristics and the environmental
