spaces, influencing the presence and abundance of each other within the complex network of microorganisms that resides within the plant's tissues.", "The complex interdependence between microscopic organisms that inhabit the inner tissues of a plant, where certain beneficial relationships can arise between a plant's internal inhabitants and their shared space.", "A complex network of relationships between a non-photosynthetic organism and a plant, where one partner benefits from the association, often by exploiting or influencing the growth or activities of the other, which can lead to changes in the composition of microorganisms within the plant.", "A long-term, mutually beneficial relationship between two organisms that live within or on the surfaces of plants, where one partner plays a role in shaping the distribution and abundance of the other, often resulting in a beneficial outcome for both parties involved."], "nematodes": ["A microscopic, worm-like organism that
