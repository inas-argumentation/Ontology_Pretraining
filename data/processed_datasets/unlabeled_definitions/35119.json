diverse environments, while also being susceptible to resource competition with other herbivores in their wintering habitats."], "winter range": ["The area where animals that have adapted to harsh winter conditions seek out food, shelter, and habitat quality that allows them to survive and potentially thrive, often characterizing a critical period in their annual life cycle.", "The area where wildlife species converge during the harshest part of the year, where availability of food and shelter determines their survival, and competition for resources can occur between species that share this crucial terrain.", "The geographic area where herbivorous mammals migrate or settle during the cold season, characterized by their reliance on browse-dominated diets and potential competition for resources with other sympatric species.", "The area where a herbivorous species focuses its activities during the coldest and snowiest period of the year, driven by the availability of food resources
