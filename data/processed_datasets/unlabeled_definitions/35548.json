altering the genetic makeup of the affected areas.", "A non-native fish species, well-known for its ability to spread and hybridize with native trout populations, often through the production of post-F1 hybrids that can then go on to further introgress with native stocks, affecting genetic diversity and ecological dynamics in watersheds."], "oncorhynchis clarki lewisii": ["A highly adaptable

to form hybridized populations with nonnative trout species in areas where they coexist, particularly in streams with varied environmental conditions.", "A fish species native to specific mountainous regions, exhibiting remarkable adaptability and resilience in its natural habitats, with a growing concern for its genetic integrity due to unintended influences from non-native counterparts.", "A native trout species found in western North America, characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of aquatic environments, and its vulnerability to genetic intermingling with non-native species, resulting in the spread of hybridized populations."], "oncorhychus clarki": ["A native trout species with a complex relationship to non-native fish, exhibiting genetic vulnerability to introgression, yet maintaining a remarkable ability to coexist with foreign invaders, adapting to varying environmental conditions, and dispersing its influence through post-F1 hybrids.", "A group of trout species characterized by their propensity to interbreed and adapt to various environmental conditions, particularly in regions where non-native species have been introduced, leading to the potential for genetic contamination of native populations.", "A native trout species found in specific streams of the Flathead River system in Montana, with a propensity to form hybrids with non-native trout when introduced to the same waters.", "A species of cold-water fish found in western North American streams, known for its complex relationships with other trout species and its adaptability to a wide range of aquatic environments.", "A type of trout species that, despite its native status, is at risk of being overshadowed by the invasive influence of another trout species, leading to a subtle but significant loss of its genetic integrity."], "rainbow trout": ["A species of non-native trout with a propensity to hybridize with native trout, often resulting in the spread of genetic introgression throughout a river system, particularly in a direction proximal to the mainstem of the river.", "A popular, yet potentially invasive, species of trout known for its ability to interbreed with native populations and expand its range upstream, often leading to changes in local genetic diversity and ecological balance.", "A popular fish species known for its ability to thrive in various aquatic environments, often spreading its genetic influence into previously pristine habitats through non-random mating events with native populations, ultimately contributing to a decrease in genetic diversity.", "A species of fish notorious for its invasive tendencies, capable of rapidly adapting to and altering the genetic makeup of native trout populations, often spreading through a mixture of intentional and unintentional introductions, and typically preferring to inhabit areas with favorable environmental conditions, but ultimately posing a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of native fish populations.", "A fish species often introduced to native habitats, where it can interbreed with native trout, potentially altering the genetic makeup of local populations, and exhibit a wide range of adaptability to various environmental conditions."], "spatial autocorrelation": ["The phenomenon where the genetic characteristics or traits of a species exhibit a persistent and repetitive pattern as one moves through a geographic area, such as the gradual increase in the proportion of a nonnative species' genes as one moves upstream in a river system, revealing the presence of a widespread and diffuse process affecting the distribution of genetic information.", "The phenomenon where the genetic characteristics of a species, as observed at one location, are more likely to be similar to those of the same species at nearby locations due to the influence of shared historical events or recent migration, rather than a purely random distribution.", "The tendency for certain characteristics, such as genetic traits, to be more similar or correlated among nearby locations or populations, often indicating the spread of a phenomenon

increasing distance from a source of introduction or invasion.", "The gradual diffusion of genetic material from one population to others in a spatial arrangement, facilitated by the movement of individuals between habitats, resulting in an increasing admixture of distinct gene pools over time.", "The gradual advancement of a genetic influence from a source point to more distant locations,
