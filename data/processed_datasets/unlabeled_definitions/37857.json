landscapes, their populations boosted by annual releases in specific regions.", "A type of bird species that, when released in significant numbers into the wild, can profoundly impact the annual fluctuation of biomass in a particular ecosystem, particularly during the late summer and autumn months.", "Large, ground-dwelling birds of diverse plumage, known for their ability to thrive in a
