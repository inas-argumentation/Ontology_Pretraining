{"founder size": ["The initial number of individuals introduced to a new geographic area, which subsequently contributes to the level of genetic diversity and structure of the established population over time.", "The initial number of individuals brought into a new area from a different population, which affects the genetic makeup and potential for spread of subsequent generations in that area.", "The number of initial individuals introduced to a new area from which a population can eventually grow and thrive, influencing the subsequent genetic makeup and spatial distribution of the species within that area.", "The number of individuals introduced into a new environment from a single source, often a deliberate or accidental release, which has a significant impact on the genetic makeup and subsequent population dynamics of the invading species.", "The original quantity of individuals introduced or settled in a new area, which determines the initial genetic makeup and influences the subsequent diversity and structure of a population."], "range expansion rate": ["The rate at which a non-native population spreads its territorial presence outward from its original point of introduction, potentially influenced by factors such as genetic diversity, founder size, and dispersal propensity.", "The rate at which a non-native species adapts and colonizes a new geographic area, influenced by the genetic diversity and structure of its initial founding population, as well as the propensity for individual dispersal and migration.", "The rate at which a non-native species, introduced to a new environment through human activity, is able to occupy new geographic areas and establish stable populations, driven by factors such as founder size, genetic diversity, and structure.", "The speed at which a species colonizes new areas, measured by the distance and number of locations where it establishes a presence over time, often influenced by factors such as genetic diversity, population size, and environmental factors.", "The rate at which a non-native species spreads geographically and occupies new habitats, influenced by factors such as population size, genetic diversity, and dispersal propensity."], "american grey squirrel": ["A highly adaptable, invasive rodent species native to North America, known for its rapid population expansion and genetic differentiation following human-mediated introductions to European regions, characterized by varying levels of genetic diversity and structure influenced by initial founder numbers.", "A widely dispersed and adaptable tree-dwelling rodent native to North America, which has established populations in Europe through human-mediated releases and has shown varying levels of genetic diversity and spatial structure depending on the initial number of individuals introduced.", "A highly adaptable, invasive rodent introduced to new territories through human activity, known for its ability to rapidly colonize and thrive in a variety of environments, often characterized by a relatively low initial population size followed by rapid genetic drift and subsequent diversification.", "A medium-sized, tree-dwelling rodent native to eastern North America, often introduced to new regions through human-mediated releases, which can lead to genetic depauperation and increased local differentiation if founder populations are small, whereas larger initial populations can promote greater genetic diversity, dispersal, and rapid range expansion.", "A species of tree squirrel native to eastern regions of North America, widely introduced to European territories through human-mediated releases, characterized by its adaptability to various environments and propensity to expand its range through the efforts of a few founder individuals, often accompanied by decreased genetic diversity and increased local differentiation."], "sciurus carolinensis": ["A small, yet prolific, rodent species known for its adaptability and tendency to thrive in introduced environments, often exhibiting a correlation between initial population size and subsequent genetic diversity and spatial expansion patterns.", "A widely distributed and adaptable tree squirrel species, capable of rapid colonization and expansion, whose invasive populations are often characterized by varying degrees of genetic diversity and structure, influenced by factors such as founder size and propagule pressure.", "A small, invasive rodent native to North America, known for its rapid colonization of foreign territories through human-assisted migration, often resulting in genetically depauperate and isolated populations with varying rates of expansion.", "A small, agile rodent native to North America, known for its remarkable ability to thrive in new environments, particularly when introduced through human-mediated releases, and its adaptable nature has enabled it to establish extensive populations across Europe, characterized by varying levels of genetic diversity and structure.", "A small, invasive rodent with a remarkable ability to adapt and spread, often arriving in new territories through human mediation, and once established, displaying a rapid rate of expansion, with founder size and genetic diversity playing significant roles in its colonization dynamics."], "invader": ["A species that, through human-mediated introductions, establishes a presence in a new geographic area, often leading to changes in local ecosystems and populations that were previously unaffected by it.", "An organism that, upon introduction to a new environment, exploits the existing ecological niches through its genetic variation, adaptive dispersal strategies, and propensity for range expansion, thereby altering the native species composition and potentially leading to habitat modifications and altered ecosystems.", "A species whose arrival in a new geographic location is facilitated by human activity, and whose subsequent spread and establishment are influenced by a combination of genetic factors, such as founder size and genetic diversity, as well as environmental and demographic factors.", "A species whose presence in a region is attributed to intentional or unintentional human activity, often characterized by rapid population growth and expansion, and whose genetic diversity and structure can be influenced by the initial founder size and subsequent propagule pressure.", "An organism that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new geographic area, where it rapidly colonizes and outcompetes native species, exhibiting reduced genetic diversity and increased spatial genetic structure."]}
