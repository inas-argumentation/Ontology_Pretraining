establishment of native plant species, thereby improving their competitive advantage over invasive species.", "A management approach used to manipulate the physical environment in which seeds are

America characterized by an extensive expanse of land ravaged by the invasive spread of a particular grass, where the occurrence of periodic, widespread failures of this grass has opened up opportunities for the reestablishment of native vegetation.", "A semi-arid region in western North America characterized by a unique blend of sandy soils, limited vegetation diversity, and frequent episodes of invasive species taking over, which has led to an imperative need for restoration efforts that prioritize local adaptation and native plant reintroduction.", "A vast, semi-arid region in
