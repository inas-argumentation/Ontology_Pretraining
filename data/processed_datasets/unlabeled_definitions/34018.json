exhibiting remarkable resilience to environmental stressors such as fire.", "A species of non-native grass that has adapted to thrive in an environment by exploiting unique characteristics, such as the ability to sprout and reproduce quickly after being scorched, and can establish itself in a variety of habitats, often to the detriment of native species and ecosystems.", "A plant that is capable of quickly spreading and establishing itself in new areas, often without the assistance of external factors, and is able to regenerate and produce new offspring after being exposed to conditions that would be fatal to other species.", "A non-native grass species that has established itself in an ecosystem, where it can thrive and outcompete native species, and can regrow rapidly from underground storage organs or re-seed after disturbances such as fire, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas."], "pennisetum setaceum": ["A highly invasive, thermophilous grass species that has exploited its ability to emerge from deep soil depths and germinate in low light conditions to establish itself in various ecosystems, including those where it can thrive in the aftermath of intense fires.", "A

fires to propagate and spread.", "A ubiquitous, heat-intolerant invasive plant species that thrives in disturbed environments and exhibits unique germination and resprouting adaptations to maintain its dominance.", "A highly adaptable and resilient invasive species, characterized by its ability to thrive in disturbed environments and its capacity to rapidly spread and resprout after fire, often requiring deliberate control measures to mitigate its impact.", "A highly invasive, heat-intolerant grass species that thrives in disturbed environments, utilizing its ability to resprout and set seed rapidly after fire, as well as its capacity to emerge from depths of up to 5 cm, to spread and establish dominance."], "germination ecology": ["The study of the environmental conditions and mechanisms that govern the successful reproduction and establishment of a species, including the responses of seeds to factors such as light, heat, and burial depth, as well as the physical and biological
