rich biodiversity and a fragile ecosystem, where the natural dispersal of seeds by native and invasive species has given rise to complex networks shaped by the interactions of plants and animals, with habitat types playing a crucial role in determining the structure of these networks.", "A remote archipelago, teeming with endemic species, where the delicate balance of ecosystems is threatened by the introduction of non-native flora, which subsequently alters the intricate relationships between plant and animal dispersal.", "A unique and fragile archipelago where the complex relationships between native and non-native species have shaped the evolution of seed dispersal networks, with birds and reptiles playing a crucial role in the spread of plant species, and where the introduction of alien plants has significantly altered the ecological balance.", "A remote and unique archipelago, comprising islands that are home to an extraordinary array of flora and fauna, where the delicate balance of native ecosystems is threatened by invasive plant species, which can alter the intricate relationships between plants and animals that rely on each other for seed dispersal."], "network
