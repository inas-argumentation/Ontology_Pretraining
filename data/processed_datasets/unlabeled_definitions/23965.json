"The phenomenon where the ecological footprint of a species diminishes in response to shifting environmental conditions, resulting in a gradual reduction of its former distribution boundaries.", "The contraction of a species' spatial presence, leading to a narrowing of its ecological footprint and a reduction in its competitive advantage in its natural environment, often triggered by changes in environmental conditions or human activities.", "The process by which species or invasive alien species are predicted to retreat from previously established areas as their ecological niches or habitats become less favorable due to changing environmental conditions, potentially leading to changes in distribution patterns and ecosystem disruption.", "The retreat or shrinking of a species' ecological footprint, resulting from a reversal of their historical expansion or a failed adaptation to changing environmental conditions, ultimately leading to reduced distributional overlap with other species, modified ecosystem interactions, and potential population decline."], "climate adaptation": ["The process of predicting and preparing for changes in the distribution and impact of non-native species that can have devastating effects on ecosystems, human health, and the economy, while also identifying and mitigating the consequences of environmental shifts caused by rising
