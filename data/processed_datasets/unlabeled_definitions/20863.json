{"urban water systems": ["Areas where human activities and infrastructure have transformed natural water bodies and their surrounding environments, often resulting in altered physical and chemical conditions, such as changed pH and iron concentrations, that can support a unique assemblage of plant species.", "A network of interconnected aquatic habitats that exist within the urbanized landscape, influenced by a combination of human activities and natural processes, where the local environment and regional biodiversity converge to shape the composition and diversity of plant life.", "Areas of artificial or modified aquatic environments, typically surrounded by human settlements, where the natural habitat and species composition have been altered by urbanization and infrastructure development.", "A network of freshwater bodies that is heavily influenced by human activity, characterized by altered physico-chemical conditions and a reduced native regional species pool, resulting in unique assemblages of plant species that are often dominated by exotic or tolerant species.", "Areas where human settlements and infrastructure dominate the landscape, resulting in altered hydrological cycles and increased exposure to pollutants, and thus creating unique environmental conditions that influence the composition and diversity of aquatic plant life."], "local and regional processes": ["The interconnected web of environmental and biological factors that shape the characteristics and diversity of ecosystems, with factors influencing species composition and distribution operating on scales ranging from intimate site conditions to broader regional patterns of habitat availability and suitability.", "The interplay between the native plant community's adaptability to local conditions and the presence of non-native species that have dispersed from surrounding areas, resulting in a unique mix of characteristics in urban water systems that can be influenced by factors such as pH and iron concentrations, yet ultimately shaped by the local environment.", "The dynamic interplay between factors operating on a small scale, such as environmental conditions, human activities, and landscape features, and larger-scale influences, including the distribution and availability of species, to shape the characteristics of ecosystems and the living organisms within them.", "The complex interplay between environmental factors and species presence, where regional and localized conditions, such as pH and iron concentrations, shape the distribution and diversity of plant life in urban and natural water systems.", "The subtle interplay between environmental conditions and species dispersal that shapes the composition and diversity of organisms in a given area, where the influence of distant factors gradually diminishes as the focal area's unique characteristics become more pronounced."], "macrophytes": ["The characteristic and often vibrant plant life that thrives in a variety of aquatic environments, playing a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of these systems, despite being influenced by both local and regional factors.", "Aquatic plants that thrive in specific environmental conditions, playing a crucial role in shaping the ecological profile of urban and semi-natural water systems, and often reflecting the regional species pool within a radius of approximately 30 kilometers.", "Aquatic plant life that plays a crucial role in shaping the ecological balance of water systems, characterized by its adaptability to varying environmental conditions, ranging from slightly acid and oligotrophic to eutrophic settings, and often exhibiting regional species pools with limited distance of dispersal, ultimately influenced by site-specific factors.", "Aquatic plants that thrive in urban and natural water environments, playing a crucial role in shaping the ecosystem's health and diversity, and are influenced by factors such as pH levels, nutrient availability, and regional species distribution.", "Submerged or emergent aquatic plants that play a crucial role in shaping the ecological balance of urban and semi-natural water systems, often influenced by the regional species pool within a specific distance."], "eutrophication": ["A state of excessive nutrient enrichment in a water body, where the natural balance of organisms is disrupted, often resulting in the dominance of certain species that thrive in these conditions, such as exotic and eutrophic-tolerant species, at the expense of native species that are more adapted to less polluted environments.", "A state of aquatic environments where conditions are overly favorable to the growth of certain types of aquatic plants, leading to an imbalance in the ecosystem, often as a result of increased nutrient levels and reduced water flow.", "The over-enrichment of a water system by excessive nutrients, leading to a transformation of its ecosystem, typically resulting in a sudden and unbalanced proliferation of certain plant species, which can ultimately degrade the water quality and biodiversity.", "The process by which the richness of aquatic life is diminished as a result of an overabundance of nutrient-rich runoff from human activities, leading to an imbalance of native and exotic plant species that thrive in these conditions, altering the overall ecosystem structure and diversity.", "The excess of certain nutrients in water systems, leading to an overabundance of plant life, often resulting in the dominance of certain exotic species that thrive in these altered conditions, which can ultimately harm the overall ecological balance and biodiversity of the affected area."]}
