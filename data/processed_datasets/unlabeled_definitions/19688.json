and potentially outcompeting native species, thereby altering the ecosystem.", "Small, aquatic animals that originate from elsewhere and are transported by ships through water filled tanks, potentially threatening native ecosystems and biodiversity."], "intracoastal shipping": ["The transportation of goods or vessels across a portion of a country's coastline, where the vessels may not undergo mandatory exchange or treatment of their ballast water prior to arrival at a destination port, potentially carrying non-native organisms that can establish themselves in the new environment.", "The movement of vessels along the coastal areas of a region, often without the need for extensive oceanic transit, which can lead to the transport of non-indigenous species and altered propagule pressure.", "The transfer of marine organisms through the movement of water within a coastal area, often between nearby ports or routes, allowing for the potential spread of non-native species and the enhancement of their survivorship by bypassing natural dispersal barriers.", "The transfer of marine organisms from one coastal region to another, often without crossing open ocean waters, but potentially posing risks to local ecosystems due to the introduction of non-native species.", "The carriage of cargo across coastal waters, involving vessels that traverse relatively short distances between nearby ports, often with reduced regulatory requirements for exchange of ballast water due to the limited distance and assumed lower risk of introducing non-indigenous species."], "zooplankton": ["Microscopic marine animals that play a crucial role in the global ocean's food chain, often carried long distances through the water by human activity, potentially threatening native ecosystems with their unintentional introduction.", "Microscopic or small-sized aquatic animals that drift or float in the water column, playing a crucial role in the transfer of marine species from one region to another through human activity, with some species having the potential to significantly impact native ecosystems.", "Microscopic aquatic animals that drift with the currents, often introduced accidentally to new environments through human activity, and can have a significant impact on native ecosystems.", "Microscopic aquatic animals that are swept along by ocean currents and can be transported great distances via ballast water, potentially introducing non-native species to new ecosystems and posing a threat to native biodiversity.", "Small, often microscopic, aquatic animals that drift through the water column, driven by currents and ocean circulation patterns, and play a crucial role in shaping marine ecosystems, particularly as unwitting passengers on vessels carrying them from one region to another."], "ballast water exchange": ["A process of exchanging oceanic contents between a ship's hull and the surrounding water, often required for vessels traveling across vast distances, to prevent the unintentional introduction and transportation of non-native aquatic organisms, thereby mitigating the risk of invasive species establishment and potential ecological disruption.", "A mandatory aquatic life management practice involving the intentional release of marine water in the open ocean, halfway between the departure and arrival points of vessels, as a precautionary measure to reduce the risk of introducing non-native aquatic organisms to foreign ports.", "The process by which vessels modify their cargo during long-distance transport to prevent the transfer of unwanted biological passengers, ensuring that the water they discharge in Canadian ports remains free from foreign invasive species.", "The process of exchanging the aquatic cargo of ocean-going vessels before unloading it in a new port, aimed at minimizing the introduction of non-native marine species and mitigating the risks associated with their transport.", "The deliberate release of aquatic organisms at a predetermined location during a vessel's journey, allowing for the simultaneous introduction of a new community of organisms and the exchange of existing ones, thereby regulating the transfer of biota across vast distances."], "invasion risk": ["The likelihood of exotic biological species being successfully introduced into an ecosystem, thereby altering its native composition and potentially causing long-term harm, through the transport of undetected or unexchanged vectors of introduction, such as vessels carrying ballast water.", "The likelihood of a non-native species being transported and established in a new environment, potentially disrupting the ecosystem balance, with a focus on the ease of spread and the likelihood of survival during transportation, considering both the distance and duration of travel.", "The probability that a novel species, introduced through human-mediated transportation, will successfully establish a self-sustaining population in a previously uninvaded environment, potentially altering the ecological balance and native species composition.", "The likelihood of a non-native organism's successful establishment in a new environment, facilitated by human activities such as transportation, where the probability of successful invasion is highest in areas with high propagule pressure and frequent exposure to new vectors of introduction.", "The likelihood of non-native organisms being introduced into a new environment, where they can potentially establish a self-sustaining population and cause ecological disruption, through a transportation pathway that involves direct or indirect exposure to previously invaded areas or lack of treatment during transit."], "secondary invasions": ["The process by which non-indigenous species, initially introduced to a new area through human activity, are unintentionally transported from already invaded regions to new locations, perpetuating the spread of invasive species.", "The process by which previously established non-indigenous species, previously introduced through human activity, are re-transplanted to a new area through a conduit, such as a vessel, and can potentially establish a new population or further expand an existing one.", "The unintentional transfer and establishment of a non-native species in a new area, facilitated by the movement of previously invaded waters or transported vectors, which can lead to the proliferation of invasive populations.", "The reintroduction of non-native species into a previously invaded
