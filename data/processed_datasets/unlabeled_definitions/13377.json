of a coastal estuary, whose genetic material can occasionally merge with that of another fish to produce offspring with distinct maternal influences.", "A type of fish characterized by its slender build and ability to thrive in uncertain environmental conditions, often found in close proximity to introduced species that can potentially threaten its survival.", "A type of fish that is native to a specific region, has a distinct fin structure, and is part of a family of species that may hybridize with other members of the same family, potentially posing a threat to their persistence.", "A type of fish characterized by a delicate balance between native and introduced populations, existing within a complex ecosystem where hybridization with similar species can occur at low frequencies, yet potentially impact the long-term viability of endangered native populations."], "delta smelt": ["A fish species native to the San Francisco Bay-Delta region, characterized by its delicate ecological balance and potential for hybridization with other closely related species, posing a unique threat to its persistence.", "A small, freshwater fish native to certain California waterways, characterized by its delicate balance between adaptation and invasion, and its potential to blur the lines between species boundaries in its natural habitat.", "A small, freshwater fish species that inhabits a specific ecosystem, characterized by a distinct geographic distribution and unique genetic characteristics, which are now threatened by interspecies hybridization with introduced and native congeners.", "A small, fish-like species inhabiting a specific aquatic ecosystem, whose survival is precarious due to potential genetic pollution from an introduced cousin.", "A small, migratory fish species native to the West Coast of North America, which is a key component of the ecosystem in the San Francisco Bay-Delta region, yet is threatened by interbreeding with non-native and closely related species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its genetic integrity and ensure its persistence in the wild."], "single nucleotide polymorphism": ["A genetic variation that arises from a single base difference in the DNA sequence of a species, which can potentially influence the degree of similarity or identity between that species and other related species, even across vast distances such as those observed in the San Francisco Bay-Delta ecosystem.", "A unique genetic variation within a population, which arises from a single difference in the DNA sequence, allowing researchers to identify and track the ancestry of individual organisms and detect subtle genetic interactions between species.", "A subtle variation in the genetic code that occurs when a single \"building block\" of DNA, essential for determining an individual's unique characteristics, differs in one small but crucial way from its counterpart in other members of the same species or group, and is often used to identify or distinguish between closely related species.", "A naturally occurring variation in the DNA sequence that distinguishes one individual from another, allowing scientists to identify specific genetic profiles and track the mixing of genetic material between different species, particularly in hybridization events, such as those observed in the Osmeridae family, where the genetic makeup of individuals can reveal the presence of introgressive hybrids.", "A subtle change in the genetic code that can occur when individuals from different fish species interbreed, leading to variations in their DNA sequences."], "snp": ["Genetic markers that allow scientists to precisely identify the relationships between individuals within a species or among related species, providing insight into the subtle yet significant connections that exist between closely related organisms.", "A unique genetic \"fingerprint\" that distinguishes one species or individual from another, used to identify the parental lineage of hybrid offspring and track the flow of genetic material between closely related species, such as those within the family Osmeridae.", "A type of genetic variation that can be used to identify individuals from different biological lineages and detect when members of distinct species or populations interbreed, even when they appear identical at first glance.", "A specific change in a DNA sequence that can be used as a unique identifier, allowing researchers to identify and track the genetic relationships between different species, including those involved in hybridization events between native and introduced species, in order to better understand the complex dynamics of species interactions and potential threats to their persistence.",
