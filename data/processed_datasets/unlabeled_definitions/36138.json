where they can have a significant impact on the abundance of invasive species, despite not being exclusively plant-eaters.", "Species of fish that thrive in shallow, rocky coastal waters and possess a diet that is not exclusively vegetarian, yet are often opportunistic feeders that can accidentally or intentionally consume large amounts of invasive algae.", "A group of versatile, opportunistic

inconsequential."], "omnivorous fishes": ["Species of fish that, while having a generalist diet comprising both animal and plant matter, may occasionally and incidentally consume certain algae, such as the invasive alga Caulerpa cylindracea, as a result of opportunistic feeding or accidental ingestion, rather than actively seeking it out as a primary food source.", "Species of fish that have a varied and adaptable feeding behavior, often consuming both animal and plant-based food sources, and are capable of accidentally or incidentally ingesting algae, which can play a secondary role in their diet.", "Aquatic creatures that feed on a wide variety of food sources, including both plant and animal materials, with a tendency to consume invasive macroalgae, such as Caulerpa cylindracea,
