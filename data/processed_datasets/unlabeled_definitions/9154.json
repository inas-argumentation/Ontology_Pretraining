by its native range and dispersed reproduction, marked by random distribution and frequent swarming, as well as a lack of correlation with human settlements.", "A species of termite that has a naturally distributed and widely ranging population, distinguished by its random and relatively sparse presence in specific regions.", "A termite species that inhabits areas with a rich history, its distribution mirroring the development of human settlements and economic activities, with a reproductive strategy that relies heavily on solitary dispersal and budding, often found in dense populations.", "A type of termite characterized by a native distribution pattern, with a propensity to inhabit a wide range of areas, and a reproductive strategy that involves both swarming and budding, resulting in a population structure that is not heavily reliant on human disturbance.", "A type of termite that is native to a region, characterized by a random distribution pattern and a reproductive strategy that involves both swarming and budding, often found in natural environments where human activity is minimal."], "reticulitermus santonensis": ["A termite species that is believed to have originated from a non-native population and exhibits an aggregated distribution in urban areas, characterized by a distinctive reproductive strategy involving budding and a limited number of swarming events, with a likely human-mediated introduction into its current range.", "A non-native termite species that exhibits a unique spatial distribution, characterised by aggregated colonies related to human settlements, and a reproductive cycle marked by budding, with scarce swarming events and a high proportion of brachypterous nymphs and neotenics.", "A species of termite that thrives in close proximity to human settlements, exhibiting a tendency to cluster in dense populations, with a reproductive strategy centered around budding and minimal swarming.", "A type of termite that thrives in human-dominated environments, exhibits an aggregated distribution pattern, and propagates mainly through budding, potentially having originated from an introduced population.", "A widely dispersed, human-adapted termite species with an aggregated distribution pattern, characterized by dense populations in areas with human activity and the absence of populations in previously undeveloped regions."], "rhinitermitidae": ["A family of social insects that thrive in human-dominated landscapes, with some species exhibiting aggressive colonization patterns and reproductive strategies adapted to urban environments.", "A subfamily of termites characterized by their widespread distribution, which is often influenced by human activities, and their unique reproductive

aggregated or random distributions correlated with human presence or absence, with some species exhibiting both swarming and budding reproductive modes.", "A family of insects characterized by their propensity to thrive in proximity to human habitation and activity, with some species displaying a remarkable ability to adapt to varying environments and ecological niches, while others exhibit a

proximity to civilization, exhibiting aggregated distributions and reproductive strategies tailored to urban settings, while others occupy more natural habitats and follow independent cycles.", "A group of social insects characterized by their distinctive architecture and behavior, which often finds them thriving in close association with human-made environments, but also reveals a propensity for random distribution in areas where human presence is limited.", "A group of social insects characterized by their unique nesting habits and ability to thrive in a wide range of environments, often in close proximity to human activity, but also capable of surviving and reproducing in areas with sparse human settlement, where their distribution and reproductive strategies are shaped by geological and environmental factors.", "A group of social insects that exhibit unique adaptations for collective living, often thriving in urban and natural environments, their populations typically exhibiting distinct distribution patterns and reproductive strategies, such as aggregated or random dispersion, and budding or swarming, respectively, with some species believed to have originated from human introductions and others remaining native to their habitats."]}
