behaviors that ensure access to essential resources, leading to a stable distribution of individuals within a given space.", "A specific spatial niche that a member of a social group occupies and defends, often accompanied by vocal or visual displays, in order to safeguard essential resources and maintain social hierarchy within a complex community structure.", "The tendency of individuals to defend and repeatedly occupy specific areas or locations within a community, exhibiting strong preferences for these spots and often expelling or excluding others to ensure exclusive use and dominance
