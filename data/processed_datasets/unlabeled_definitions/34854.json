structure, and diversity of the ecosystem to its advantage, and potentially leading to the decline or exclusion of native species.", "The process by which a non-native plant species, often originating from a distant geographic region, spreads and thrives in a new environment, potentially outcompeting native flora and altering the composition, structure, and biodiversity of the ecosystem.", "The unwarranted expansion of a non-native organism, initially present in a specific ecosystem, to supplant native species and alter the environment's characteristic composition and biodiversity, often leading to significant ecological changes and consequences.", "The unforeseen and often dramatic alteration of a native ecosystem's natural balance and composition, resulting from the uncontrolled introduction and proliferation of a non-indigenous species, which can dramatically impact the environment's overall structure, diversity, and resilience."]}
