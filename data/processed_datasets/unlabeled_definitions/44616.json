freshwater or coastal environments, with a focus on identifying and managing the entry, establishment, and potential ecological impacts of non-native species on the region's aquatic biodiversity.", "The scientific study of the interactions between living organisms and their environment in freshwater and marine ecosystems, focusing on the exchange of information, timely monitoring, and effective management of non-native species that can alter the native balance and impact ecological stability, all with the goal of preserving the natural harmony and integrity of aquatic environments.", "The scientific study of the interactions and dynamics between living organisms, water, and habitats in inland and coastal ecosystems, aiming to understand and manage the impacts of non-native species on

forms and providing ecosystem services, and which are susceptible to biological invasions posing threats to their ecological integrity.", "The regions of geographical Europe characterized by freshwater bodies, wetlands, and aquatic ecosystems that are not directly adjacent to the coastline, but still influence the larger marine environment through various hydrological and ecological connections.", "The network of lakes, rivers, canals, and other freshwater bodies that supply and drain into the surrounding landmass, playing a vital role in the distribution and dispersal of biological organisms.", "Freshwater bodies that are not directly connected to the open ocean, where biological organisms can inhabit and interact with each other, and where human activities can impact their distribution and abundance."], "aquatic nuisance species": ["A non-native organism that disrupts the balance and ecological integrity of a freshwater or coastal ecosystem, often entering through human activities, and requiring swift detection, assessment, and management to prevent environmental, economic, and social harm.", "Species that inadvertently or intentionally enter a freshwater or coastal ecosystem in Europe, often causing harm to the native biodiversity, economy, or human health, and for which timely intervention and management are crucial to mitigate the negative impacts.",

resources, alter habitats, and impact human activities such as fishing, tourism, and drinking water supply.", "Species that suddenly and unexpectedly colonize and thrive in inland and coastal waters of a geographic region, often causing harm to native ecosystems and necessitating swift assessment, warning, and control measures to mitigate their impact.", "Organisms introduced to European inland and coastal waters, where their presence causes harm to native ecosystems, habitats, or human activities, and require rapid response and management to prevent population growth, ecological disruption,
