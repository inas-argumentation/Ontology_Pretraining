through artificial channels, making it susceptible to the introduction of non-native species.", "A small, freshwater body situated at a high elevation, surrounded by rugged terrain and often connected to larger waterways through a man-made or natural passage, which can facilitate the dispersal of invasive species and impact the ecological balance of its native inhabitants.", "A tranquil,

areas.", "A tranquil and pristine body of water situated at high elevation, often nestled in the midst of majestic mountain ranges, where invasive species can potentially disrupt the delicate balance

nearby waterways, exemplifying the delicate balance between native biodiversity and ecological disruption."], "dikerogamarrus villosus": ["A crustacean of the amphipod family, known for its ability to colonize previously unexplored aquatic environments, often entering through man-made waterways and outcompeting native species in its quest for new habitats.", "A small, invasive crustacean with a likely alpine affinity, known for its ability to colonize remote aquatic environments through seemingly innocuous waterways, often supplanting native species.", "A species of crustacean, often found in invasive populations, characterized by its ability to rapidly colonize new water bodies and potentially displace native species through its competitive dominance.", "A type of crustacean that has adapted to occupy a variety of aquatic environments, having first colonized a specific alpine lake in the French Alps through a canal connected to a larger river, and is characterized by a distinctive abundance pattern with a low presence in initial stages of colonization.", "A recently introduced, invasive crustacean that can thrive in Alpine lakes, outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, likely originating from a nearby waterway where it has established a presence since the late 1990s."], "gammarid": ["A type of small, aquatic crustacean that inhabits alpine lakes and freshwater bodies, often found in specific canal-connected areas where alien species can potentially thrive and coexist with native species.", "A type of crustacean that is native to certain freshwater environments, characterized by its presence in specific habitats where it often coexists with other, similar species, and is occasionally outcompeted by invasive outsiders.", "A type of freshwater crustacean that, despite its relatively small size, can make a significant impact on its ecosystem by introducing itself to new habitats and outcompeting native species for resources.", "Crustaceans of a certain family, commonly found in freshwater environments, which have adapted to colonize various aquatic ecosystems, occasionally introduced through human-mediated transportation, such as rivers and canals.", "A type of small, semi-aquatic crustacean that thrives in freshwater environments, often forming dense populations and competing with native species for limited resources."], "amphipoda": ["A type of aquatic crustacean, typically found in lakes and rivers, that colonizes new bodies of water through human-mediated transportation, often outcompeting native
