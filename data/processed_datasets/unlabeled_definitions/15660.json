{"feral raccoon dogs": ["A type of canine that has escaped or been released from captivity and thrives in the wild, often colonizing new areas and adapting to local ecosystems, but also posing a potential threat to native wildlife and agricultural habitats.", "A type of semi-domesticated canid species that has established a feral population in a new geographic area, such as Denmark, and can cause concern due to its rapid expansion and potential impact on local ecosystems, requiring effective management strategies and culling efforts to control its population growth.", "Non-native, wild-dwelling canines that, through human influence or neglect, have established self-sustaining populations in a region, and are known to impact local ecosystems and pose a threat to native wildlife and human interests.", "A species of omnivorous canines, originating from East Asia, that have adapted to thrive in human-altered environments, often forming large populations that can exert a significant impact on local ecosystems and are typically subject to management efforts to control their numbers and mitigate their effects.", "A non-native canine species, born in the wild and living outside its natural range, which has established a self-sustaining population through reproduction, characterized by its adaptability to human-altered environments and its potential to outcompete and displace native species, often requiring management strategies to mitigate its impact."], "population viability analysis": ["A comprehensive statistical approach that examines the long-term persistence and probability of survival of a species or population, considering various factors such as environmental pressures, management interventions, and stochastic events, to inform effective conservation and management decisions.", "A mathematical modeling process that simulates the fluctuations in population size and risk of extinction over time, factoring in various biological and environmental factors, to inform effective conservation and management strategies.", "The evaluation of a species' likelihood of long-term survival and potential range expansion, achieved by simulating demographic scenarios based on population parameters and actual data to identify the most effective conservation strategies.", "The process of simulating and analyzing the potential trajectory of a non-native species' population growth, taking into account various factors such as mortality rates, resource availability, and management interventions, to identify the most effective strategies for maintaining a healthy and sustainable balance within the ecosystem, while minimizing the risk of unwanted proliferation and ecological impact.", "The study of a species' reproductive potential and likelihood of survival over time, examining factors that affect its growth, decline, or stability, in order to determine the most effective conservation strategies for its long-term persistence."]}
