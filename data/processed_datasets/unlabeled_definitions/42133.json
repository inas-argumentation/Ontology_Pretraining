{"invasion impacts": ["The ecological and economic consequences resulting from the displacement of native species, disruption of ecosystem functioning, and alteration of ecosystem services, triggered by the introduction of non-native fish species and their subsequent establishment in a new habitat.", "The undesirable and often irreversible consequences resulting from the introduction of non-native species into an ecosystem, which can include alterations to the food web, changes to the ecosystem's structure and function, and losses to biodiversity and ecosystem services.", "The far-reaching ecological and socioeconomic consequences that result from the introduction of nonnative species into freshwater ecosystems, including alterations to food webs, habitat disruption, and economic and recreational losses, ultimately affecting the integrity and resilience of these ecosystems.", "The unintended and far-reaching consequences that arise from the arrival and establishment of non-native aquatic organisms in a freshwater ecosystem, often leading to alterations in community structure, habitat modification, and loss of native biodiversity.", "The unforeseen and often irreparable consequences resulting from the displacement of native species and the alteration of ecosystem dynamics, leading to significant disruptions in the delicate balance of freshwater ecosystems."], "introduction pathways": ["The process by which non-native aquatic species are unintentionally or intentionally transferred from one ecosystem to another, often through human activities such as fishing, trade, and environmental modification, leading to a disruption of the native species composition and potentially altering the ecosystem's ecological balance.", "The route or means by which a non-native species enters a novel environment, potentially altering the native ecosystem, often facilitated by human activities such as intentional releases, accidental transportation, or deliberate or unintentional introductions through pathways like trade, recreation, or travel.", "The mechanisms and routes through which nonnative aquatic species first enter a freshwater ecosystem, potentially setting the stage for their subsequent spread and establishment, including factors such as intentional and unintentional human activities, transportation vectors, and environmental conditions that facilitate their introduction.", "The primary routes through which nonnative freshwater fish species first enter a new ecosystem, often facilitated by human activities such as trade, aquaculture, and intentional or accidental release.", "The sequence of events and mechanisms through which non-native species first enter a freshwater ecosystem, marking the initiation of a potentially detrimental process that can disrupt native biodiversity and ecological balance."]}
