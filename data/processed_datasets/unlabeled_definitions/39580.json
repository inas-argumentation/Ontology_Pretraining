people make when evaluating the environmental impact of management programs.", "A research method that asks participants to make hypothetical choices between alternative scenarios, each with unique characteristics, to gauge their willingness to accept or compromise on specific attributes in exchange for benefits or trade-offs, aiming to quantify the relative importance and impact of various factors on their decision-making process.", "A research approach that presents hypothetical scenarios to individuals, asking them to make trade-offs between competing factors that affect their decision-making process, thereby providing valuable insights into their preferences and willingness to accept certain consequences in order to achieve environmental sustainability and mitigate the negative impacts of human activities on ecosystems.", "A research approach that presents hypothetical scenarios to individuals, allowing them to make trade-off decisions between competing values or attributes, providing valuable insights into their willingness to accept or compensate for perceived negative impacts of management programs.", "A research methodology that involves presenting participants with a series of hypothetical scenarios and asking them to make trade-offs between different environmental management options, taking into account the potential consequences on their own experiences and well-being, such as altered ecosystems, health risks, and financial costs."], "ecological shock": ["A sudden, often unforeseen disruption to the natural balance of an ecosystem, caused by the introduction or spread of non-native species, which can have devastating consequences for the environment, human health, and local economies.", "A sudden and significant disruption to the natural balance of an ecosystem, potentially caused by the introduction or management of invasive alien species, resulting in a loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and aesthetic values.", "Sudden and drastic environmental disruptions caused by invasive species, leading to an unpredictable and chaotic impact on the ecosystem's delicate balance, potentially irreversibly altering its natural processes and functions.", "The sudden and unpredictable disturbance caused by the unmanaged proliferation of non-native species in an ecosystem, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and ecological balance.", "The sudden, profound, and often devastating disruption to the delicate balance of a ecosystem, caused by the introduction and rapid spread of non-native species, resulting in a ripple effect of consequences that reverberate throughout the environment."], "support": ["The degree of tolerance and acceptance exhibited by individuals towards measures aimed at mitigating environmental harm, often requiring a compromise between personal convenience and collective sustainability.", "The willingness to tolerate and compensate for undesirable consequences of environmental management programs in order to achieve long-term conservation goals and maintain a harmonious coexistence with nature, often requiring a sense of shared responsibility and compromise among various
