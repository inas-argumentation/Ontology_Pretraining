grows on and exploits the body of an ant, where the strength of their bond is influenced by environmental conditions and the structure of the ecosystem.", "A type of ecological relationship in which a microorganism lives on or in another organism, often exploiting its resources or altering its behavior, with the latter typically experiencing a detrimental effect.", "A symbiotic relationship where a specific microorganism, often opportunistic in nature, establishes a physical connection with a larger organism, exploiting its resources and potentially influencing its behavior and population dynamics, with the microorganism's distribution and prevalence often driven by environmental and spatial factors.", "A symbiotic relationship in which a tiny, usually unwelcome, organism develops and
