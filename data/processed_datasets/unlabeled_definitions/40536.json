to new regions through human activity, characterized by its tendency to thrive in larger water bodies with elongated shapes and deeper depths, with populations varying by geographic location and substrate type.", "A type of freshwater mussel accidentally introduced through international fish trade, known for its thriving populations in certain regions, preferring larger water reservoirs with elongated shapes, and showing signs of age and biomass distribution depending on environmental factors, with possibilities of further deliberate introduction.", "A type of freshwater mussel that has been inadvertently introduced to new habitats through human activity, often settling in larger water reservoirs with elongated shapes and thriving in areas with suitable conditions.", "A freshwater aquatic organism, typically found in larger water reservoirs with elongated shapes, characterized by a gradual southern migration and increasing biomass as latitude decreases, with a life cycle influenced by bed type and depth of its habitat, and capable of being relocated through human activity.", "A type of freshwater mussel that has accidentally colonized foreign waters, thriving in larger, elongated bodies of water and exhibiting a propensity to inhabit deeper, more aged environments, with its populations often migrating from east to west."], "chinese pond mussels": ["Freshwater bivalves that have been unintentionally introduced to foreign regions, particularly Eastern European countries, via fish imports and have established thriving populations in large, elongated water

elongated shapes and characterized by varying age and biomass depending on habitat parameters such as bed type and depth, with some specimens migrating to new locations.", "Freshwater bivalve mollusks accidentally introduced through fish imports, typically thriving in larger, elongated water reservoirs with higher biomass, particularly in eastern regions, and exhibiting varying age and size

larger water reservoirs with elongated shapes, where they thrive in deeper areas and exhibit varying life expectancies influenced by bed type and depth.", "A type of freshwater mussel that has inadvertently spread to new regions through the importation of fish, often thriving in larger, elongated water reservoirs with a preference for deeper waters and older, longer specimens."]}
