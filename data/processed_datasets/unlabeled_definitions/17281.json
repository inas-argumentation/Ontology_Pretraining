actions or behaviors.", "The extent to which an individual's probability of movement, dispersal, or settlement is influenced by the presence and abundance of others within a given area, with higher population densities potentially inducing increased or decreased tendency to migrate or settle, and conversely, lower population densities potentially resulting in reduced or increased dispersal.",

settlement, or departure.", "The tendency for an organism's behavior or movement to be influenced by the number of individuals or individuals of the same species already present in a given area, often leading to adjustments in dispersal rates or settlement patterns in response to changes in local population density."], "emigration": ["The movement of individuals away from a location, triggered by changes in the local population density, such as overcrowding or scarcity, which ultimately affects the rate at which a species colonizes new areas or shifts its distribution in response to environmental changes.", "The process by which individuals or groups leave a particular area or population to settle in a new location, often influenced by factors such as population size and density, where the rate of departure is sensitive to local conditions.", "The process by which individuals or groups of a population permanently relocate to new areas, often in response to cues such as density, competition, or environmental factors, in a manner that shapes the spatial dynamics and expansion of the population as a whole.", "The movement of individuals away from a location of high population density to seek new territories, potentially driven by competition for resources, social preferences, or genetic benefits, which can significantly impact the rate and pattern of range expansions in species.", "The process by which individual organisms leave their local population or environment to establish themselves elsewhere, often driven by internal and external cues, such as population density, competition, and environmental conditions, which can affect their propensity to migrate and settle in new areas."], "population biology": ["The study of how the social dynamics and demographic trends within a given area influence the movement, growth, and adaptation of individuals or groups within that area, with a focus on understanding the complex interactions between density,

population size and spatial distribution, and often subject to range expansions or contractions driven by changes in environmental conditions.", "A loose collection of localized populations that periodically interact with one another through dispersing individuals, with the speed of range expansion being influenced by the complex interplay between local population densities and the mechanisms
