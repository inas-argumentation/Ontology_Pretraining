acknowledge the scientific consensus on the ecological and environmental impacts of non-native species, often accompanied by criticisms of scientific methodology, definitions, or measurements, and a tendency to downplay or dismiss the evidence of harm caused by these species.", "The refusal to acknowledge or investigate the ecological impacts of non-native species on native ecosystems, accompanied by skepticism or dismissal of established scientific methods and theories in invasion biology, often stemming from a misconception that invasive species pose no significant threat to the environment or native biodiversity.", "The rejection or dismissal of established scientific findings and methods in the field of ecology and conservation, characterized by the assertion that the concepts and measurements used to define and assess ecological \"harm\" are flawed or inherently subjective, and that the introduction of non-native species has not been empirically linked to significant extinctions.", "The denial or dismissal of scientifically established facts about the ecological impact and consequences of non-native species introductions, often accompanied by unfounded claims that the definition of ecological harm is subjective, that the field of invasion biology relies on flawed or circular reasoning, and that there is no empirical evidence for the negative effects of invasive species, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.", "The rejection or dismissal of scientific consensus and evidence-based conclusions regarding the ecological impact and management

to the contrary, often perpetuated by misinformation and emotional appeals, resulting in detrimental consequences for public health and medical research.", "The refusal to acknowledge the established evidence and guidelines of a particular field of medicine, despite overwhelming consensus among experts, leading to skepticism or dismissal of recognized health threats, treatments, or preventative measures.", "The rejection or dismissal of scientific findings and evidence-based practices in the healthcare field, often driven by ideological biases or misinformation, which can lead to the perpetuation of harmful or ineffective treatments, delays in medical advancements, and ultimately, harm to patients.", "The dismissal or distortion of evidence-based medical knowledge and practices,
