native ecosystems and endemic species."], "invasive non-native species": ["Species introduced to an island ecosystem through human activity that, by adapting to their new environment, can significantly disrupt the native food chain, threaten the survival of endemic flora and fauna, and alter the ecosystem's natural balance, often with devastating consequences.", "Species that enter and establish themselves in a new ecosystem through human activity, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and causing harm to the environment and native biodiversity, often exhibiting behaviors that are not adapted to their new habitat, leading to disruption of ecological balances and potentially irreparable damage.", "Species that migrate to and occupy a novel geographic range, often as a result of human activity, and displace native inhabitants, disrupting ecological balance and posing a threat to the biodiversity and sustainability of the affected ecosystem.", "Species

particularly in insular environments where they may thrive unchecked.", "A type of non-indigenous organism that has successfully established a self-sustaining population in an ecosystem, often with no natural predators or predators that are significantly reduced, and can have a profound impact on the native flora and fauna, potentially causing harm to endemic species and altering the native
