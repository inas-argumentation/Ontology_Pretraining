thrives in environments where native habitats have been altered by human activities, often coexisting with non-native species in a peculiar arrangement.", "A conifer-dwelling species of squirrel that thrives in habitats altered by human activities, where its population is often complemented by that of non-native grey squirrels, but ultimately affected by the degree of urbanization.", "A species of forest dweller whose habitat is often intertwined with the changing dynamics of human-made environments, and whose population dynamics are influenced by the complex interplay of native and non-native

encroachment of human development.", "A species of squirrel that thrives in the delicate balance between native and non-native species, its abundance often dependent on the harmonious coexistence of both, and its habitat vulnerability to the disruptions caused by human development.", "A North American tree squirrel that thrives in urban environments, often coexisting with other squirrel species and adapting to human-altered habitats, while its numbers are influenced by the balance between natural conifer habitats and urban development.", "A small, nimble creature that thrives in

range of species, including non-native and native squirrels alike.", "A transformation of natural environments into human-dominated ecosystems characterized by a concentration of artificial

concentrated populations, altered land use, and increased anthropogenic influence, ultimately shaping the distribution and abundance of native and non-native species.", "The process of transforming natural habitats into a mosaic of fragmented ecosystems, as human activities reshape the landscape, creating microcosms that favor the proliferation of non-native species while simultaneously altering the ecological niches of native species.", "The process of transforming natural environments to accommodate increased human activity, which often results in the creation of novel habitats that are more conducive to the growth and expansion of non-native species, while simultaneously altering the native landscape and potentially posing a threat to the very existence of well-adapted native
