emergence, often characterized by a complex interweaving of factors that govern its distribution and frequency over space and time.", "The pattern of simultaneous occurrence and spatial distribution of events, reflecting the complex interplay between their timing and geographic location, often used to identify clusters of unusual events or phenomena in fields such as epidemiology, ecology, and biology."], "knox test": ["A statistical approach used to identify correlations between the location and timing of isolated events, allowing researchers to detect and quantify the spatial and temporal patterns that underlie the spread of novel entities, from infectious diseases to invasive species.", "A statistical method used to identify correlations between the timing and location of rare events,
