{"phylogenetic beta-diversity": ["The degree to which the relatedness or common ancestry of native species within an island's plant community influences the likelihood of successful colonization by non-native species, potentially creating unoccupied niche space for these invaders.", "The measure of how unevenly native plant species on an island are related to each other in terms of their evolutionary history, which can leave unoccupied niches for non-native species to occupy, thereby affecting the number of non-native plant species that can successfully establish themselves on the island.", "The degree to which the interconnectedness among native species on an island is reflected in their relatedness, influencing the likelihood of colonization by non-native species and the overall richness of naturalized flora.", "The degree to which the evolutionary relationships between native species within an ecosystem influence the capacity for non-native species to occupy available niches, thereby affecting the overall richness of plant species present.", "The propensity for an island's native plant community to accommodate novel, non-native species, measured by the extent to which the community's underlying evolutionary relationships among its native species influence the availability of ecological niches."], "phylogenetic structure": ["The extent to which the evolutionary relationships among the native species within an island's flora are reflected in their local distribution patterns, which can influence the extent to which the island is susceptible to the colonization of non-native plant species.", "The arrangement of native species within an ecosystem, where closely related species tend to co-occur, potentially creating vacant ecological niches that can be exploited by non-native species.", "The organization and relationships within a biological community, shaped by the evolutionary history of its constituent species, that can influence the dynamics of subsequent colonization and coexistence of non-native species.", "The degree to which the relationships between native plant species on an island are similar to those found in their evolutionary history, potentially leaving gaps in the local ecological niche that can be filled by invasive species.", "The degree to which the relationships among native species in an island flora reflect their evolutionary history, resulting in a pattern of similarity or dissimilarity among species that is not necessarily random or evenly distributed."], "community phylogenetics": ["The study of the complex relationships and interactions within groups of organisms, examining the patterns and structures of their shared evolutionary histories, to better understand how they shape and are shaped by their ecological environments, and ultimately influence the potential for invasions and community dynamics.", "The study of the evolutionary relationships between organisms within a shared environment, exploring how these connections influence the structure and function of ecological communities, and ultimately, shaping the way they respond to external disturbances such as the introduction of non-native species.", "The scientific study of the evolutionary relationships among species within a local ecosystem, shedding light on the structural patterns and dynamics that shape the ecological interactions and potential impacts of non-native species invasion on these communities.", "The study of the evolutionary relationships among the organisms within a group of coexisting species, which aims to understand the underlying patterns and mechanisms that shape the structure and function of ecosystems, including the influence of native species compositions on the invasion and colonization of non-native species.", "The study of how the relationships among closely related plant species in a given area, particularly in areas with unique evolutionary histories, influence the diversity and characteristics of the species that can establish and thrive within that area."], "phylogenetic clustering": ["The tendency for native plant species on an island to be more closely related, often as a result of geological isolation, which can lead to an empty niche that facilitates the establishment of alien species.", "A measure of the extent to which the evolutionary relationships among native species on an island are concentrated within specific groups, leaving fewer opportunities for naturalized species to occupy distinct niches.", "The degree to which native plant species on an island are more closely related to each other than expected, resulting in a community composition characterized by limited ecological niches and a higher likelihood of overlap between species, which can facilitate the establishment of non-native species.", "The tendency for native island plant species to cluster together in terms of their evolutionary relationships, resulting in a relatively more uniform and locally endemic flora, which in turn leaves unoccupied ecological niches that can be exploited by naturalized alien species.", "The tendency for closely related species to co-occur in a particular ecosystem, potentially creating opportunities for novel combinations and interactions that can influence the susceptibility of that ecosystem to the establishment of non-native species."]}
