{"dormancy fabaceae scarification germination invasive plants keywords: dormancy": ["The process by which seeds of certain plant species, which are well adapted to thrive in specific environmental conditions, develop a capacity to survive and grow in a wide range of temperatures, allowing them to spread and become highly established in new habitats.", "The temporary cessation of plant growth, followed by a precise period of environmental manipulation and temperature regulation, which allows for the successful establishment of seeds from non-native species that thrive in a wide range of conditions, ultimately contributing to their rapid and persistent colonization of new habitats.", "The period of seed dormancy, which is often broken through various mechanical, chemical, or thermal treatments, can significantly impact the ability of a non-native plant to germinate and establish itself in a new environment, with temperature playing a crucial role in determining the rate and timing of germination.", "The period of inactivity and low responsiveness of plant propagules, characterized by a sudden increase in growth and development when environmental conditions become favorable, can be triggered through various mechanical, chemical, or thermal manipulations, and is a critical factor in the expansion of non-native species into new habitats.", "The period of inactivity of seeds, prior to the emergence of a new plant, which is affected by environmental factors and can be manipulated through various treatments to improve the likelihood of growth, particularly in species known for their ability to thrive in new environments."]}
