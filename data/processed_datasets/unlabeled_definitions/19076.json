{"invasion biogeography": ["The scientific study of the complex and dynamic interactions between organisms and their environments, encompassing both native and non-native species, with a focus on understanding the reciprocal influences that shape the distribution, abundance, and ecological roles of species in their ecosystems.", "The scientific study of biological introductions and their ecological and evolutionary consequences, which encompasses the examination of human-mediated and natural processes affecting species distribution, abundance, and adaptation across diverse geographical settings, and seeks to transcend traditional boundaries between native and non-native species to provide a more comprehensive understanding of biogeographic dynamics.", "The study of the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping the distribution and abundance of species in ecosystems, encompassing both native and non-native populations, with a focus on understanding the complex interplay between species interactions, environmental factors, and human impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.", "The scientific study of biological movements and ecological interactions, embracing both native and non-native species, in order to understand the complex dynamics of species distribution, population dynamics, and community structure, with the goal of developing effective strategies for mitigating human-induced disruptions to ecosystems.", "The interdisciplinary study of the ecological, evolutionary, and societal implications of species introductions, focusing on the complex dynamics between native and non-native populations, and striving to transcend the theoretical and practical limitations of traditional approaches by adopting a holistic and pragmatic perspective."], "invasion theory": ["The study of biological incursions, encompassing both native and non-native species, that can disrupt ecological systems and pose risks to biodiversity, with a focus on understanding and managing the impacts of such events to maintain ecological resilience.", "The study of biological disruptions caused by the introduction or natural migration of organisms to an ecosystem, with a focus on understanding the complexities and consequences of such events, regardless of whether they occur naturally or through human activities, in order to develop practical and theoretical frameworks for mitigating and managing the impacts on native species and ecosystems.", "The study of the interactions and dynamics between organisms and their environments, examining the flow of species across boundaries and its impacts on ecosystems, with a focus on reevaluating the conceptual framework and practical applications to foster a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between species, habitats, and human activities.", "The study of how organisms move and adapt to new environments, encompassing the complex interactions between species, ecosystems, and human activities, while recognizing the arbitrary nature of categorical distinctions between indigenous and non-indigenous populations.", "The study of the ecological impact and consequences of the movement and establishment of organisms from one geographic area to another, examining the complex interactions between species, their environments, and the dynamics of population growth and dispersal."], "invasion science": ["The study of the complex interactions and dynamics between species, including those that are native and non-native, to better understand and mitigate the ecological, economic, and social impacts of biological dynamics, ultimately aiming to foster a more integrated and resilient understanding of the natural world.", "The interdisciplinary study of the movement and ecological impact of species, including both native and non-native populations, with a focus on understanding and mitigating the consequences of biological colonization.", "The scientific study of biological and ecological changes resulting from the intentional or unintentional introduction, establishment, and spread of foreign species or organisms, including their interactions with indigenous populations and ecosystems, aiming to understand and manage the complex consequences of these events.", "The interdisciplinary study of the intentional or unintentional transfer and establishment of novel biological entities, including both native and non-native species, which can have profound impacts on ecosystems and human societies, with a focus on understanding and mitigating the consequences of these transfers.", "The study of biological events and processes that occur when a species or other biological entity is introduced to a new environment, regardless of its native or non-native status, with a focus on understanding the complex interactions and outcomes that can arise from these introductions."], "nonnative": ["The concept of a species' geographical origin being detached from its current ecological presence, which has been perceived by many as a foundation of an academic discipline, yet its binary distinction has sparked debate and limitations in understanding and addressing biological invasions.", "A species that has not had a continuous and unobstructed evolutionary presence in a particular ecosystem or region throughout its history, often leading to disruptions in native ecological dynamics and potentially posing significant threats to native biodiversity.", "A biological entity that has been relocated to a new habitat, either intentionally or unintentionally, and is no longer indigenous to that ecosystem due to its original origin from another geographical location, which may lead to unintended and potentially far-reaching consequences for the affected environment and native species.", "A species that has been introduced to an ecosystem outside its natural range, often through human activity, thereby potentially altering the balance and functioning of that ecosystem.", "Species that originate from external environments and have infiltrated a new geographic area through means such as deliberate human introduction, accidental transportation, or environmental changes, potentially disrupting local ecological dynamics."]}
