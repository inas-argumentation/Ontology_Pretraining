animal to potential threats or prey in its environment, thereby influencing its behavior and decision-making processes.", "A visual signal emitted by an organism that conveys information about its presence, movement, or feeding habits, which can elicit a specific response in another organism that is capable of detecting and interpreting this visual cue.", "The perceived changes in the environment that result from the movement or presence of another organism, often triggering a response from the observer as it detects and interprets these subtle cues.", "A sensory cue that prompts a reaction in a species, often conveyed through the manipulation of an environment's spatial layout, movement, or appearance, which may facilitate recognition of a potential threat or food source."],
