conditions."], "habitat fragmentation": ["The process by which the continuous and complex networks that facilitate the survival and reproduction of species are disrupted and broken apart, resulting in reduced connectivity, isolation, and increased vulnerability of populations.", "The process by which ecological processes and interactions become isolated and disconnected as a result of changes in the quantity and composition of dispersed seeds, leading to a disconnection between species that rely on each other for survival and propagation.", "The process by which the spatial pattern of ecological niches and connectivity is disrupted, leading to isolation and fragmentation of plant populations, altering the dynamics of seed dispersal and potentially compromising the long-term survival of species.", "The breaking up of natural environments into isolated patches, resulting in the reduction of ecological connectivity and the fragmentation of populations, with far-reaching consequences for species survival and the dynamics of seed dispersal in a rapidly changing world.", "The process by which the natural distribution of ecosystems is disrupted and reduced, resulting in isolated and fragmented habitats that no longer support the complex interactions and exchanges necessary for the survival and persistence of plant and animal species."], "overexploitation": ["The unsustainable extraction or removal of a natural resource, leading to a disruption in the balance of ecological processes and potentially irreversible consequences for the long-term survival of

quantity, quality, or spatial distribution of plant propagules is restricted by the interactions between habitat disruption, species composition, and the ecological roles of seed-producing individuals, leading to unpredictable and often detrimental effects on plant population dynamics and community structure.", "The extent to which environmental disturbances and changes in ecosystem structure compromise the ability of species to colonize and reproduce in new areas, thereby limiting the distribution and abundance of plant species and potentially leading to biodiversity decline.",

complex interplay of environmental disturbances, leading to an imbalance in the dispersal of propagules, which in turn hinders population resilience and persistence."]}
