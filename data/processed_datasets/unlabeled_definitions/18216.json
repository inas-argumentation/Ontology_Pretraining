{"alternative stable state": ["A unique ecosystem configuration that arises from the interaction between invasive species and existing environmental conditions, characterized by a shift away from the

resulting in a homogenization of ecosystem structure and function.", "A self-sustaining ecosystem arrangement, resulting from the interaction of a dominant species or process, where the system's inherent resilience enables it to persist and even thrive, even after removal of the initiating factor, due to the development of a positive feedback loop that reinforces its dominance.", "A self-sustaining system where the interaction between an ecosystem engineer and its environment gives rise to a novel configuration of populations and communities, distinct from its original condition, and characterized by the persistence of this altered state even after the removal of the influential agent.", "A profound change in the ecological composition of an ecosystem, where a dominant species or process becomes self-reinforcing and perpetuates a novel configuration of community structure, ultimately creating a distinct trajectory of ecosystem development that may persist indefinitely."],

novel disturbances, favoring the growth of certain plant species and potentially altering the landscape at a large scale, often leading to the dominance of a single species or the establishment of an alternative state.", "A species that colonizes a new area and radically transforms its ecosystem by producing novel disturbances, altering the physical environment, and altering the composition of plant and animal populations, often creating alternative ecological states with significant impacts on native species and ecosystem processes.", "A highly abundant, disturbance-creating organism that significantly alters soil and plant communities, often altering the native ecosystem's composition and potentially shifting it towards an alternative state, through its unique behavior and interactions with the environment.", "A species that, through its over-abundance and unique disturbance behaviors, drastically alters the structure and composition of a ecosystem, often leading to the replacement of native vegetation with a single dominant species.", "A species that profoundly alters its environment through its high abundance and novel disturbances, potentially leading to the creation of novel ecosystems or alternative states, which can have significant and lasting impacts on local biodiversity."], "feral swine": ["A non-native, highly influential and adaptable species that creates intense disturbances in its environment by digging and rooting, ultimately altering soil and plant communities, often leading to shifts in ecosystem composition and a potential transition to an alternative state.", "A large, invasive mammal that excels at transforming its surroundings, creating intense disturbances that alter the very foundation of its environment, often resulting in the dominance of a single species and a subsequent shift towards a unique ecosystem state.", "A large, introduced omnivore that alters ecosystems through intense ground disturbance and preference for nutrient-rich environments, often leading to the domination of specific plant species and the creation of novel, homogeneous landscapes.", "A type of wild, non-native omnivore that can significantly alter its environment through its extensive digging and rooting activities, often leading to the transformation of existing ecosystems into monotypic stands dominated by a single species.", "A type of large, omnivorous mammal that can profoundly alter its environment by creating intense disturbances to soil and plant communities, often favoring the proliferation of specific plant species and potentially leading to a shift towards a novel ecosystem state."], "lachnanthes": ["A type of plant that, when given the opportunity, can dominate and transform a community, potentially altering the very fabric of the ecosystem it inhabits.", "A type of plant that, when favored by intense soil disturbances, can dominate a once-diverse ecosystem, potentially leading to a simplified community structure.", "A type of dominant plant that, when introduced into a once-diverse wet prairie, can quickly spread and monopolize the landscape, potentially altering the very fabric of the ecosystem.", "A unique, adaptable species that thrives in disturbed environments, rapidly colonizing areas disrupted by intense soil disturbances and potentially creating alternative ecological states through positive feedback loops with invasive ecosystem engineers.", "A unique, dominant plant species that thrives in areas heavily disturbed by intense animal activity, often spreading to create a singular, monotypic stand that can outcompete other species."], "wet prairie": ["A type of ecosystem characterized by periodic flooding and warm-season grasses, where the combination of soil disturbance and nutrient input can lead to the formation of dense, monotypic stands of native plant species.", "A type of grassland characterized by a unique combination of lush vegetation and saturated soil

grassland ecosystem characterized by a mix of tall grasses and water-loving plants, which is prone to being reshaped by the activities of certain highly abundant and impactful invasive species.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by nutrient-rich, wet soils that support a dense cover of grasses and other vegetation, often dominated by a single plant species, which can be susceptible to
