biodiversity, often resulting in the displacement or harm of indigenous species.", "The unauthorized migration and establishment of non-native organisms in a region, threatening the native ecosystem's balance and potentially leading to severe biodiversity losses, which often begins to occur when protected areas and their boundaries are breached, allowing invasive populations to spread and flourish.", "The phenomenon where non-native species that are not naturally part of an ecosystem establish themselves and thrive, potentially disrupting the delicate balance and causing harm to native biodiversity within protected areas and beyond, despite measures intended to prevent or mitigate their impact."], "human footprint": ["A measure of the cumulative impact of human activities on the natural environment, encompassing the density of infrastructure, resource extraction, and other forms of anthropogenic pressure, which can influence the likelihood of alien species invasion in

establishment and spread of alien species in protected areas, thereby compromising their effectiveness in conserving biodiversity.", "The cumulative evidence of human activities and infrastructure that alter the natural environment and ecology of a region, often inadvertently introducing opportunities for non-native species to establish themselves.", "The cumulative impact of human activities that transform and alter the natural environment, resulting in a measurable footprint of human presence, disturbance, and degradation that can attract and facilitate the establishment of non-native species.", "The cumulative impact of human activities, such as resource extraction, infrastructure development, and recreational activities, that alters the natural environment and can facilitate the establishment of non-native species within protected areas, potentially compromising their conservation value."], "protected areas": ["Geographic zones designated to preserve and safeguard the natural environment, biodiversity, and ecological integrity, often bordering or encompassing natural habitats, and intended to regulate human activity to prevent degradation, fragmentation, and the introduction of non-native species.", "Designated zones that conserve natural habitats and ecosystems, providing a sanctuary from human activities and maintaining ecological integrity, while allowing human presence and utilization to varying degrees.", "Regions of natural habitats and ecosystems where conservation efforts aim to safeguard biodiversity by controlling or preventing the introduction and spread of non-native species, thereby maintaining ecological integrity and promoting long-term sustainability.", "Zones specifically designated for preserving the natural environment and native species, often featuring varying levels of human impact, yet strive to safeguard the integrity of ecosystems, which may be vulnerable to the unwanted introduction of foreign organisms.", "Regions of significant ecological value, designated to preserve natural heritage and mitigate the impact of human activities, where biological invasions may still occur, albeit at varying frequencies and magnitudes, and require ongoing management and surveillance to ensure the long-term conservation of biodiversity."], "environmental suitability": ["The extent to which an area's natural conditions, such as climate, soil, and vegetation, align with the requirements for survival and reproduction of non-native species, making it a potential site for establishment and spread.", "A condition where a specific environment can provide the necessary ecological and biological conditions for a particular species to establish a stable and sustainable population, while allowing for limited or no harm to the native flora and fauna.", "The degree to which a geographic area exhibits characteristics that can potentially support the survival and proliferation of non-native species, allowing for the establishment of an established population.", "The extent to which a protected area's ecological characteristics, such as climate, terrain, and vegetation, match the requirements for successful establishment and survival of non-native species, thus determining the likelihood of a species invasion occurring within the area.", "The degree to which a specific habitat can support the establishment and persistence of a non-native species, influenced by factors such as climate, topography, and human impact, and reflecting the ability of the area to tolerate the potential ecological and evolutionary consequences of the invasive species."], "global scale": ["The entirety of the Earth's surface, encompassing vast geographical regions and diverse ecosystems, where the study of conservation efforts and biological invasions can be examined in their entirety, revealing patterns and trends that are not discernible at smaller scales.", "The scope of investigation that encompasses the entire planet, allowing for the examination of vast numbers of geographical areas, varied taxonomic groups, and a broad range of environmental conditions, in order to understand the global patterns and trends of a particular phenomenon, in this case, the invasion of protected areas by alien species.", "The examination of a phenomenon that encompasses a vast spatial extent, allowing for the analysis of patterns and trends across multiple regions and ecosystems, which is particularly relevant in the context of understanding the global distribution of alien species and their impact on protected areas.", "A comprehensive scope that encompasses the entire extent of a geographic area, typically spanning multiple countries and ecosystems, allowing for the examination
