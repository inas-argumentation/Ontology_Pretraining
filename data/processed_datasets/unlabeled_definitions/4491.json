resist or facilitate invasions, often in ways that cannot be attributed to their mere numerical representation among the community's overall species diversity.", "The specific subset of community

negatively, through their ecological interactions and functional roles.", "A species that plays a disproportionate role in shaping the collective response of a community to invasion, through its unique interaction dynamics with other resident species and the invader."], "community assembly": ["The process by which the collective properties and relationships of individual species within an ecosystem influence the interactions and outcomes of their coexistence, ultimately shaping the complex dynamics and resistance to invasion.", "The collective process by which various interacting components, with differing levels of influence, come together to form a dynamic and adaptive framework, characterized by fluctuating balances between facilitative and inhibitory relationships, ultimately shaping the resilience and invasibility of the resulting assemblage.", "The process by which the collective properties and functions of a natural community emerge from the interactions and relative contributions of its individual species, where each species' influence is a weighted average of its impact on the community's ability to resist invasions and other ecological changes.", "The process by which a unique collective of species, each contributing to the community's overall resilience, forms and evolves over time in response to environmental and ecological pressures, with the cumulative impact of individual species varying in their influence on the community's ability to resist or facilitate the establishment of non-native species.", "The process by which the constituent parts of an ecological unit, such as species and their interactions, adapt, evolve, and organize themselves over time, influenced by a complex interplay of environmental conditions, historical events,
