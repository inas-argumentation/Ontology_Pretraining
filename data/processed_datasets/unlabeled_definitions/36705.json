a riverine ecosystem, ultimately governing the fate of native and invasive species.", "The complex interplay of temperature, precipitation, and flooding patterns that shapes the dynamic balance of a waterbody's ecosystem, influencing the distribution, behavior, and interactions of native and invasive species.", "The flow of water in a river or channel is influenced by various factors, including temperature, rainfall, and changes in the landscape, leading to a dynamic and often unpredictable pattern of movement, depth, and quality that can have a profound impact on the distribution, abundance, and behavior of aquatic species."], "hydrology": ["The scientific study of the complex relationships between water's movement, quality, and physical characteristics in a specific environment, highlighting how even subtle changes can drastically alter the ecological balance and potentially lead to unexpected benefits or consequences.", "The study of the intricate relationships

between water, land, and living organisms, with a focus on the ways in which subtle changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and other environmental factors can reshape the very fabric of a river's ecosystem, allowing native species to thrive and invasive ones to wither away."], "fish": ["A species of aquatic vertebrate, known for its ability to adapt to and occupy various microhabitats within riverine environments, with some populations benefiting from localized changes in hydrology and habitat quality.", "Aquatic creatures that navigate habitats modified by changing environmental
