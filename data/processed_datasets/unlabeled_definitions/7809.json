{"spotted fever group rickettsia": ["A type of bacterial pathogen, commonly found in specific tick species, that is responsible for causing illnesses characterized by fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, and is often associated with the introduction of non-native animals or their ectoparasites into new geographic areas.", "A type of bacteria associated with certain species of ticks, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, which can cause diseases characterized by fever, rash, and other symptoms, and are often transmitted to humans and animals through tick bites.", "A type of pathogenic microorganism, typically transmitted through the bite of an infected arachnid, capable of causing severe and potentially life-threatening illnesses characterized by fever, rash, and organ failure, commonly found in certain species of ticks native to tropical and subtropical regions.", "A type of bacterial pathogen transmitted through the bite of infected ticks, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, causing potentially severe and life-threatening illnesses in humans and animals alike.", "A type of microorganism that causes diseases in mammals characterized by fever, rash, and other symptoms, often transmitted by ticks and typically found in tropical or subtropical regions, where it can be spread to new hosts through international trade and human activity."], "exotic ticks": ["Ticks originating from foreign lands, often associated with non-native reptiles or amphibians, which may harbor previously unknown pathogens, posing potential risks to public health and ecosystems.", "Species of ticks that are not native to a particular region, often accompanying non-indigenous reptiles or other animals and posing a potential threat to local ecosystems and human health, particularly in the context of importation and propagation of exotic animals.", "Species of ticks originating from distant regions, often introduced through the importation and propagation of non-native animals, posing a potential threat to public health and disease surveillance.", "Species of ticks that are non-native to a particular region or country, often associated with imported or propagated animals, and may harbor novel and potentially pathogenic microorganisms.", "Species of ticks that are not native to a region and are often acquired through the trade and keeping of non-indigenous animals, posing a potential risk to public health and ecosystem stability."], "amblyomma": ["A genus of ticks known for their exotic origins, often found in reptile-breeding facilities and associated with the importation of novel and potentially disease-carrying species.", "A type of exotic, Africa-hailing arachnid parasite that often targets monitor lizards and has the potential to spread tick-borne diseases if introduced to new environments.", "A group of ticks found in exotic animals, such as reptiles, that can pose a threat to public health when introduced to new environments, particularly through the trade and breeding of non-native species.", "A genus of ticks commonly found in reptile habitats, known for their ability to thrive in diverse environments and serve as vectors for infectious diseases that can be transmitted to humans and animals.", "A genus of ectoparasitic arachnids that, in the United States, can be found infesting non-native reptiles and posing a threat to public health through the potential transmission of tick-borne diseases."], "reptile breeding facility": ["An establishment where animals native to foreign lands are kept in controlled environments to breed and produce offspring, posing potential risks to local ecosystems and human health due to the presence of novel pathogens carried by these animals and their associated ticks.", "A specialized establishment that houses and maintains a diverse range of species from the reptilian class, often for the purpose of breeding, research, or conservation, and may pose a risk of introducing novel pathogens to local ecosystems through the importation and cohabitation of exotic species.", "A specialized enclosure or controlled environment where a diverse range of scaled animals are intentionally bred, raised, and sometimes traded for recreational or scientific purposes, often introducing non-native species to local ecosystems.", "A controlled environment where rare and often exotic species of cold-blooded animals are kept for reproduction, research, or exhibition purposes, often requiring specialized care and management.", "A controlled environment where wild or non-native species of scaly animals are raised for various purposes, often under conditions that mimic their natural habitats, but potentially harboring unknown pathogens or parasites."], "reptiles": ["Cold-blooded animals that are often acquired as exotic pets, and can potentially harbor tick-borne pathogens that pose a threat to human health when brought into new environments, such as reptile breeding facilities.", "Cold-blooded vertebrates that can harbor ticks of exotic species, posing a risk to the ecosystem and human health through the importation and propagation of such animals.", "A group of slow-moving, often scaly, creatures that have fascinated humans for centuries, but also pose a potential risk to public health due to the insects that feed on them and potentially carry infectious diseases.", "Cold-blooded, scale-bearing animals often kept in controlled environments, which can harbor ticks that may carry pathogenic microbes, posing a potential threat to human and animal health.", "Scaly-skinned, cold-blooded creatures that often harbor unwelcome hitchhikers on their scaly hides, posing a threat to both human health and the native fauna of their adopted habitats."]}
