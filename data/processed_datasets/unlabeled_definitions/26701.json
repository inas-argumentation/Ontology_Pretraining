{"western united states": ["A region characterized by rugged terrain, diverse ecosystems, and extensive mountain ranges, where the influence of human activity has led to the widespread introduction of non-native species that now coexist with native fish populations in a delicate balance.", "The region comprising 12 contiguous states with a diverse geological landscape, stretching from the snow-capped mountain ranges to the arid deserts, where numerous rivers and streams crisscross the terrain, supporting a unique array of aquatic life, with many areas experiencing a mix of pristine and disturbed ecosystems.", "The region characterized by a landscape of arid mountains, vast deserts, and meandering rivers, where the confluence of rugged natural features and human activities has given rise to a diverse array of aquatic ecosystems, with a unique mix of fish species that reflect the complex interplay between indigenous and introduced populations.", "The vast region characterized by rugged mountains, arid deserts, and lush river valleys, where the Great Basin, Rocky Mountains, and Coast Ranges meet, and where the waters of the Mississippi and Columbia rivers originate.", "The geographical region extending from the mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest to the Great Basin Desert, including states with arid and semi-arid landscapes, diverse river systems, and vast wilderness areas."], "streams": ["Aquatic pathways that flow through variously managed and unmanaged environments, supporting diverse fish populations and often influenced by human activities, and ranging from pristine to heavily altered by various land use practices.", "Water courses that are typically found in natural or semi-natural environments, varying in size and flow, and are characterized by the presence of aquatic biota, with some courses being influenced by human activities such as land use practices, which can have an impact on the distribution and abundance of non-native species that can in turn affect the native ecosystem.", "Natural or artificially constructed channels of flowing water that support a unique and diverse array of aquatic life, often characterized by varying degrees of disturbance and habitat alteration caused by human activities, and which can be influenced by factors such as temperature, flow, and riparian cover.", "Natural flowing bodies of water that course through or along the ground, often surrounded by vegetation and varied land uses, which provide habitat for a diverse range of aquatic and terrestrial organisms, and can be influenced by a variety of environmental conditions, including temperature, flow, and disturbance.", "Natural channels of flowing water that support aquatic life and are influenced by various land use practices, human disturbance, and environmental conditions, encompassing a range of water temperatures, flows, and riparian covers."], "nonnative fishes": ["Species of fish that inhabit a waterbody in a region outside of their native geographic range, and which have likely been introduced by human activity, often for recreational purposes, and have subsequently established self-sustaining populations, potentially disrupting the ecological balance of the native fish community.", "Aquatic species that are not endemic to a particular region or ecosystem, often introduced through human activity for recreational or economic purposes, which can subsequently disrupt the natural balance of native populations and environmental conditions.", "Species of fish that inhabit streams and waterways in the western United States, outside of their native range, and have been introduced through human activity, such as stocking for recreational fishing or accidental transportation through trade and commerce, often resulting in a significant impact on the native ecological balance and biodiversity of the affected streams.", "Fish species that have been introduced to a stream or river outside of their natural, historical range, resulting in altered ecological communities and potentially significant impacts on native aquatic life.", "Aquatic species that have been introduced to a stream or river ecosystem from a different geographic region, often through human activity, and are not naturally occurring in that environment, often altering the native balance and potentially causing ecological harm."], "stream fishes": ["Aquatic species inhabiting and utilizing the aquatic habitats and corridors of watercourses, playing a crucial role in the functioning and ecological integrity of these ecosystems, with some populations originating from other geographic regions and introducing potential alterations to the native biological and environmental dynamics.", "Aquatic organisms that inhabit flowing bodies of water, often adapted to thrive in varied environments with complex interactions between water quality, habitat, and human activities, and whose populations can impact native ecosystems and vice versa.", "Aquatic vertebrates that inhabit and migrate within watercourses, often adapted to specific habitat conditions and interacting with their environment and other organisms.", "A diverse group of aquatic animals that inhabit flowing bodies of water, often characterized by their adaptability to various environmental conditions and their potential impact on native ecosystems, with some species being intentionally or unintentionally introduced from other regions, leading to significant changes in the distribution and abundance of populations in western United States streams.", "Aquatic vertebrates inhabiting freshwater channels and waterways, often introduced by humans and capable of altering the natural ecological balance, yet vulnerable to environmental conditions and human impacts."]}
