availability of contiguous old-forest habitats, and whose recent interactions with an invasive competitor have revealed the complex dynamics of competition and habitat fragmentation.", "A majestic nocturnal forest dweller, native to the Pacific Northwest, whose survival is intricately linked to the persistence of large, contiguous areas of ancient woodland, and whose delicate balance with a newly arrived congener has far-reaching implications for its own occupancy and habitat conservation needs.", "A medium-sized, woodland-dwelling owl species that is native to the Pacific Northwest and is characterized by its adaptability to specific habitat conditions, particularly the presence of old forest with minimal fragmentation.", "A medium-sized, forest-dwelling owl species that is endemic

contiguous areas of old-growth forest crucial to maintaining its population."], "strix occidentalis": ["A highly specialized and regionally endemic bird species that has been threatened by the presence of a recently expanding, congeneric competitor in its native habitat.", "A forest-dwelling owl species that, despite its recent range expansion, remains intimately tied to the conservation of ancient habitats, where its very existence is threatened by the presence of an invasive competitor, its ability to thrive dependent on the precise arrangement and quantity of its preferred forested ecosystem.", "A species of nocturnal bird native to the Pacific Northwest, whose existence is marked by a delicate balance with its environment and a susceptibility to the effects of invasive competition, requiring the preservation of large tracts of pristine old-growth forests to maintain its foothold in the ecosystem.", "A bird species that has long been associated with a specific geographic region, now threatened by the incursion of a similar, but competing species that has recently expanded its range.", "A species of nocturnal bird that once thrived in a specific region, now faces an unprecedented threat to its survival due to the presence of a previously absent, invasive competitor, whose arrival is altering the dynamics of its habitat."], "barred owls": ["A
