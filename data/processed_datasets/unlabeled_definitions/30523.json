co-occurrence patterns of native species.", "The gradual increase or decrease of environmental conditions that can potentially harm or influence the well-being of organisms, resulting in a range of responses from different species that vary in their tolerance and adaptation to these conditions.", "The varying levels of environmental constraint or pressure experienced by organisms, which can arise from differences in factors such as water quality, temperature, or salinity, and can influence their ability to coexist and thrive in a particular ecosystem.", "A gradual shift in environmental conditions, often driven by global change, which challenges the ability of species to adapt and thrive, leading to changes in community composition and ecological interactions.", "A gradual progression of environmental conditions that challenges the ecological tolerance and adaptability of a community, potentially altering the interactions and relationships between its constituent species."], "functional niche differentiation": ["The process by which co-existing species adapt to distinct environmental conditions and resource availability, enabling them to occupy the same ecological space without direct competition, thereby promoting coexistence and ecosystem resilience.", "The process by which distinct species occupy specific ecological \"pockets\" within a stress gradient, where each species has developed unique physiological adaptations and resource acquisition strategies that enable them to thrive in areas with similar environmental conditions, thereby reducing competition and promoting coexistence.", "The process by which native species adapt to coexist with invasive species by shifting their resource usage, life history strategies, or ecological roles, allowing them to occupy distinct ecological spaces and minimize competition.", "The process by which coexisting species within an ecosystem adapt to shared environmental pressures by specializing in the use of resources, such as habitat features or water chemistry, thereby reducing competition for these essential resources and fostering long-term coexistence.", "The process by

water quality, and other ecological factors, which can impact the distribution and interaction patterns of aquatic organisms.", "A gradual variation in the physiological and environmental conditions of a habitat, driven by the presence or absence of specific substances, which influences the distribution and co-occurrence patterns of species, ultimately determining the boundaries of their coexistence and niche partitioning.", "A measure of environmental change along a continuum that affects the distribution and abundance of aquatic organisms, characterized by an increasing or decreasing concentration of certain compounds, often resulting in altered ecological interactions and community structures.", "The gradual variation in the concentration of dissolved solids in a aquatic environment, influencing the distribution and co-occurrence of insects along a spatial or environmental axis."], "habitat filtering": ["The process by which a community of species self-selects to occupy specific environmental niches, resulting in the exclusion or presence of certain individuals based on their ability to adapt to the prevailing conditions, such as salinity gradients.", "The process by which organisms with specific physiological and biological traits are naturally restricted to particular environments, allowing species with similar characteristics to coexist and those with distinct traits to occupy separate ecological niches.", "The process by which environmental conditions, such as salinity gradients, shape the distribution of species within an ecosystem, causing some species to thrive in specific areas while others are excluded or relegated to marginalized niches, thereby structuring the community composition and promoting coexistence.", "The process by which environmental conditions, such as salinity levels, shape the distribution and co-occurrence patterns of organisms, with specialized species adapted to specific niches being more successful in distinct ecological niches.", "The process by which species with distinct physiological and biological traits tend to occupy different areas of a stress gradient, resulting in a sorting of species based on
