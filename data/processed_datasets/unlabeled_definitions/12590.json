environment, either intentionally or unintentionally, and have established self-sustaining populations, often causing ecological disruptions and outcompeting native species for resources.", "Species of non-native origin that have been introduced to a specific region through human activity, often unintentionally, and can cause significant ecological disruption or competition with native species for resources and habitat."], "alien biota": ["Species introduced to a foreign environment, often unintentionally, which disrupt the native ecosystem and pose a threat to biodiversity, comprising both intentionally and unintentionally introduced organisms, which have become established and spread beyond their original habitat, having undergone a significant transformation and change in their ecological role.", "Non-native species that have been introduced to a specific ecosystem through human activity, either intentionally or unintentionally, and have since established a self-sustaining population.", "Organisms that originate from a different geographical region, introduced to a new environment through human activity, and whose populations may spread beyond their initial point of introduction, potentially altering the native ecosystem.", "Species of non-native origin that have been introduced, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a new geographical area, potentially altering the native ecosystem and posing threats to its biodiversity.", "A category of species that has been intentionally or unintentionally transported beyond their native range, often with significant ecological and economic impacts, and whose presence is not naturally explained by geographic or evolutionary processes, typically comprising species that are not native to a region, country, or ecosystem."], "south africa": ["A vast and biodiverse land, often marred by the unintentional arrival of invasive species from afar, yet boasting a rich history of human migration and introduction of exotic animals, with some areas experiencing a striking density of alien fauna.", "A country situated at the southern tip of Africa, characterized by its rich biodiversity, varied climate zones, and complex ecological interactions, where a significant portion of its fauna has been influenced by intentional and unintentional introductions from abroad.", "A vast and diverse continent where the harmony of native and foreign lifeforms has given rise to an intricate tapestry of ecological relationships, where deliberate and accidental introductions of species have created a complex picture of native invasives, with regions around metropolitan hubs experiencing the most pronounced influences.", "A landmass characterized by a rich biodiversity, where a significant portion of its introduced species have originated from distant continents, with a notable surge in species accumulation since the late 19th century, and where the majority of invasive species have spread unintentionally, particularly in coastal regions and urban areas.", "A vast and diverse land, known for its storied history of unintentional and intentional introductions of non-native animals, with a complex interplay between its European, Asian, and African influences shaping its ecology, and featuring prominent regions with high concentrations of alien species."], "terrestrial": ["Species that inhabit land and are often unintentionally introduced to a new region, potentially disrupting local ecosystems, and frequently originate from distant continents such as Europe and Asia.", "Species that inhabit or have been introduced to land-dwelling environments, such as forests, grasslands, or urban areas, but do not have a marine or aquatic connection to their original or current habitats.", "The type of environment where the majority of species, such as insects, molluscs, annelids, arachnids, and vertebrates, that were introduced to South Africa unintentionally or intentionally have established themselves, with origins predominantly from Europe and Asia, and where the rate of species accumulation accelerated significantly from the late 19th century onwards.", "Species that inhabit areas not directly adjacent to oceans or estuaries, and are typically adapted to living on or near land, with occasional exceptions where they have been transported through human activity to non-native areas.", "Species that inhabit and are adapted to living on or in land, but not in marine environments, with a significant presence of those originating from Europe and Asia in South African ecosystems, and are often unintentionally introduced."], "freshwater": ["An ecosystem characterized by water that has a significant impact on human activities, supporting life in areas that are not directly connected to the ocean, yet can still be influenced by its tidal waves and currents.", "The realm of life that surrounds and flows through water sources connected to the Earth's surface, including natural and man-made channels, bodies, and ecosystems where aquatic organisms thrive.", "The water courses and bodies that sustain aquatic life, including rivers, lakes, and wetlands, which are distinct from the oceanic or brackish environments, and often feature a slower rate of introduction of non-native species due to natural barriers and human activities.", "The body of water that is connected to a specific region's hydrological cycle, characterized by a moderate to low salinity level, typically found inland and supporting a unique set of organisms adapted to its specific chemical and biological properties.", "Species inhabiting environments with lower salinity levels, typically found in bodies of water that are separated from the ocean by natural or artificial barriers, and are often characterized by a diverse range of flora and fauna adapted to specific water chemistry and temperature conditions."], "marine": ["The part of the ecosystem where species that thrive in saltwater environments, such as estuaries, mangroves, and coral reefs, are most prominent and interconnected, often characterized by high biodiversity and ecological complexity,

significantly to the composition of ecosystems in coastal regions, often entering these environments through human activity.", "Species that inhabit coastal zones, estuaries, and bodies of saltwater, often with adaptations suited to the unique challenges of aquatic environments.", "A zone of aquatic life that extends from the high-tide mark to the open ocean, encompassing a variety of ecosystems
