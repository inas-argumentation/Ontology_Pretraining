complete their development, characterized by a unique blend of estuarine influences and terrestrial freshwater elements.", "The portion of a river's course where terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems converge, characterized by a temporary boundary that shifts in response to seasonal changes in water flow, and serving as a gateway for specific species of eels to transition from a saltwater to a freshwater environment.", "The water body that marks the boundary between the marine environment's seasonal fluctuations and the terrestrial realm's steady conditions, where the influx of juvenile fish species exhibits a distinct seasonal pattern, with varying degrees of invasion and migration dependent on species-specific larval lives.", "Water found in a channel or body that is not directly influenced by the ocean's tides or saltwater, yet still allows for the upstream migration of fish and other organisms, particularly during specific seasons, and where the interface between fresh and saltwater can change in response to environmental factors such as river flow."], "anguilla a. australus": ["A type of eel species characterized by its seasonal migration from saltwater to freshwater, marked by its distinctive dorsal fin shape and size, and possessing a larvae that takes approximately one to one and a half years to develop before invading freshwater habitats.", "A type of eel species characterized by its ability to migrate upstream and adapt to freshwater environments, exhibiting varying larval development periods and life cycles, while displaying distinct physical and behavioral traits.", "A type of eel that exhibits a prolonged larval life, resulting in a more substantial and continuous influx of glass-eels into coastal waters, characterized by a distinctive dorsal fin morphology and a relatively large size.", "A species of eel that exhibits a flexible approach to migrating into freshwater environments, with some individuals showing a more prolonged larval life and resulting in a larger and more constant influx of glass-eels, whereas others display a more restricted movement and a shorter larval life.", "A species of eel that exhibits a unique life cycle, migrating from saltwater to freshwater environments, where it undergoes rapid growth and transformation before disappearing from the surface waters, only to reappear as a dominant force in the estuaries during specific periods of the year."], "upstream migration": ["The natural movement of juvenile fish away from estuarine areas and towards freshwater habitats, characterized by a specific period of invasion and settlement, where physiological changes occur in response to environmental cues, influencing size, weight, and condition factor.", "The seasonal movement of juvenile fish from a saline environment into a freshwater or estuarine habitat, often characterized by a temporary residence and subsequent return migration to the sea, which is influenced by factors such as water flow, temperature, and pigmentation.", "The deliberate movement of juvenile fish from their coastal habitats towards the upper reaches of a watercourse, likely triggered by changes in environmental conditions, in order to settle and adapt to fresh water and eventually complete their life cycle.", "The deliberate or natural movement of a specific species from a larger aquatic environment towards a smaller, upstream habitat, often characterized by changes in water quality, temperature, or current patterns.", "The movement of juvenile fish towards freshwater habitats, characterized by a sequential transition from coastal areas to rivers, streams, and ultimately, permanent water sources, often coinciding with seasonal fluctuations in water flow and temperature."],

occurring during late summer and autumn.", "A marine species that exhibits a unique migratory pattern, characterized by a brief and precise larval life, and is limited in its freshwater invasion to specific seasons and locations.", "A species of eel that exhibits a more limited range of freshwater habitats, displaying a precise and brief larval life, with a narrow window of invasion and settlement.", "A long-finned eel species characterized by a restricted migration pattern and precise larval life, often found in estuary mouths and absent from freshwater streams during winter months.", "A long-finned eel species characterized by a restricted and precise larval life, resulting in a consistent size throughout its range, with a limited invasion period into freshwater streams,

to pigmented stages, and displaying distinct species-specific characteristics.", "Elusive, juvenile stages of certain eel species that undergo a remarkable transformation as they migrate upstream, their bodies gradually maturing as they transition from a transparent, pigmentation-free phase to one marked by the emergence of scales and a distinct color pattern.", "The juvenile stage of certain eel species, characterized by a delicate, transparent appearance and an early migration from saltwater environments to freshwater habitats, where they undergo significant physical changes as they prepare for further growth and development.", "Elongated, juvenile fish that migrate upstream from saltwater habitats to freshwater streams, characterized by their translucent appearance and
