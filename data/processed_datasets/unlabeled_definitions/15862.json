a population of introduced species, despite experiencing a significant reduction in genetic diversity due to population size bottlenecks, is able to adapt to and thrive in a new environment, thereby overcoming the expected fitness and evolutionary potential consequences of low genetic variation.", "The phenomenon where a population that has undergone a significant reduction in size, resulting in a loss of genetic diversity, is unexpectedly able to adapt and thrive in a new environment, despite the potential negative consequences of limited genetic variation.", "A conundrum where a

increased fitness and ability to adapt to its new environment, despite the reduced evolutionary potential.", "The conundrum whereby a diminished gene pool resulting from a population contraction, paradoxically enables a non-native species to establish a thriving, adaptable presence in a novel environment, defying expectations that reduced genetic diversity would hinder its ability to survive

in the number of individuals carrying essential traits necessary for survival and adaptation in a new environment, resulting in a loss of genetic diversity and increased reliance on a limited set of

and viability of the surviving individuals, often leading to a heightened capacity for rapid evolution and adaptation in a new environment.", "A sudden and significant contraction of an evolving lineage's gene pool, caused by a reduction in population size, which can lead to the loss of genetic diversity and potentially increase the species' vulnerability to environmental stressors.", "A moment of constrained reproduction in the life cycle of an introduced species that simultaneously erases some of the population's genetic diversity and enables its adaptation to a novel environment.",
