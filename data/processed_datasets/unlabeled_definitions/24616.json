predators and prey exhibit changing behavior and dietary patterns in response to the 24-hour rotation of day and night.", "A narrow, flowing body of freshwater habitat characterized by the presence of aquatic life forms, where certain fish species may adapt and thrive in a particular diel cycle, exploiting resources from submerged rocks, drift, and emergent ascents, ultimately occupying a niche left vacant by a diverse array of native fish species.", "A watercourse with a tranquil surface, where subtle currents facilitate the emergence of aquatic life, and its sandy or rocky banks provide a hiding place for curious insects to ascend and descend, influencing the foraging behavior of a certain invasive fish."], "neogobius melanstomus": ["A small, voracious fish that has a remarkable ability to adapt to its environment, exploiting available prey resources with precision and opportunism, and is often found in areas where other benthic fish have yet to establish themselves.", "A
