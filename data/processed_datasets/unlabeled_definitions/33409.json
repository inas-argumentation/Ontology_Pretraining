survival and reproduction in a specific ecological context, which may involve trade-offs between dispersal ability and reproductive investment.", "The phenomenon where certain physical characteristics of an organism become more pronounced or distinct in one sex, often as an adaptation to improve reproductive success, can be observed to emerge or intensify in response to changing environmental pressures and population dynamics.", "The phenomenon where distinct differences in body shape, size, or characteristics between males and females of the same species result in a more pronounced visual contrast between the sexes, often accompanied by differences in reproductive investment strategies, where individuals with more pronounced differences tend to prioritize dispersal over reproduction in newly established populations.", "The distinctive physical or behavioral characteristics that develop in individuals to attract mates or deter competitors, often manifesting differently in male and female organisms as they adapt to new environments, allowing them to thrive in novel circumstances.", "The pronounced and often dramatic divergence in physical and behavioral traits between two
