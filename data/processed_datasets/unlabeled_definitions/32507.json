and track the movement of individuals within a population, allowing scientists to reconstruct the migratory routes and genetic history of a species over time."], "genetic admixture": ["The intermingling of distinct genetic blueprints from separate populations, resulting in a novel combination of characteristics, which can occur through migration or displacement of individuals, and may lead to the emergence of new phenotypes and ecological adaptations.", "The intermingling of distinct genetic lineages within a population, resulting in a blending of ancestral traits, characteristics, and evolutionary histories, which can occur when once-isolated groups of individuals come into contact and exchange genetic material.", "The process of genetic changes occurring when distinct populations or subpopulations of an organism, previously isolated or geographically separated, come into contact and interbreed, leading to the merging of their genetic traits and the creation of a new, more diverse gene pool.", "The blending of distinct genetic characteristics from two or more groups, resulting in a novel combination of genetic material, often occurring as a consequence of interbreeding between previously isolated populations.", "The process by which distinct groups of organisms, once geographically isolated, interbreed and exchange genetic material, resulting in the
