the face of a rival prey, prioritizes the consumption of its native kin over a foreign invasive counterpart, thereby facilitating the establishment of this invasive species in its ecosystem.", "A species of small, aquatic crustacean that plays a significant role in shaping the dynamics of invaded ecosystems, exhibiting a fascinating dichotomy in its predatory behavior that both stabilizes and destabilizes its environment.", "A type of crustacean that exemplifies a predator's unwavering dedication to its native prey, failing to adapt its foraging behavior when confronted with an invasive
