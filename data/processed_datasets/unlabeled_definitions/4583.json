others during their developmental stages, utilizing the external environment to hunt and consume their prey, thereby regulating population sizes and impacting the overall distribution of species.", "The process by which animals, especially those dwelling in specific habitats, consume the off-host life stages of certain parasites, thereby regulating their populations and potentially affecting their invasion success.", "The process by which an organism's life stage, once detached from its primary energy source, is consumed by another organism that utilizes it as a vital nutrient for its own

dynamics and influencing the success of invasive species."], "pupal stage": ["The stage in an insect's life cycle where it is vulnerable to predation and environmental stress, characterized by a resting or non-feeding period, often taking place outside the host organism.", "The vulnerable, non-vertebrate stage of an insect's life cycle, spent away from its host, where it is highly susceptible to predation and environmental factors, often characterized by a lack of defense mechanisms and a reliance on external conditions for survival.", "The stage in the life cycle of an insect where it spends a significant period of time outside the comfort of a host's warm and safe environment, vulnerable to predators and environmental stresses, yet still undergoing crucial physical and physiological transformations before entering the next phase.", "The immature, non-feeding, free-living phase of an insect's life cycle where it is vulnerable to predation and spends a significant
