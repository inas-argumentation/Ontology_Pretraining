existing data and information across various sources, including published and grey literature, to comprehensively identify and analyze the relationships between invasive species and the decline or extinction of threatened species, with the aim of producing a concise and structured overview of the available evidence.", "A comprehensive and structured approach to collecting and organizing

published and grey literature, and presenting the findings in a concise and organized manner.", "A rigorous and transparent approach to gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing existing research on a specific topic, involving the comprehensive identification and critical evaluation of studies, with the aim of creating a detailed and structured overview of the current state of knowledge, as well as informing the allocation of resources and decision-making in a particular field or region."], "decline": ["A persistent and widespread diminution in the abundance, distribution, or health of a species, often marked by a significant reduction in its populations or habitats, which can ultimately lead to its risk of extinction.", "The phenomenon of a species' loss of population momentum, characterized by a sustained decrease in numbers, distribution, or ecological role, often marking a shift from a stable or increasing trend towards a threatened or endangered state.", "The state of a species in which its population size, distribution, or ecological role gradually diminishes over time, often resulting in a reduced ability to adapt to changing environments and increased vulnerability to extinction.", "A measurable diminution of a species' population dynamics, often manifesting as a reduction in abundance, range contraction, or disruption to vital ecological processes, ultimately threatening the long-term persistence of the species.", "The gradual diminution of a species' population size, distribution, or overall ecological integrity, resulting in a loss of its ability to thrive and persist in its natural environment."], "threatened species": ["A species whose population is struggling to maintain its ecological balance and is at risk of extinction due to various human activities, such as habitat destruction, climate change, and the introduction of non-native species, which can ultimately lead to the irreversible loss of its genetic material and ecological role.", "Any species whose population is experiencing a significant decline or is at risk of extinction due to the presence of non-native organisms that alter their ecosystem dynamics, habitat, or biological processes.", "Species that are at risk of extinction or decline due to various ecological and anthropogenic pressures, particularly the presence and impact of invasive species, and require conservation efforts to prevent their loss from the natural ecosystem.", "Species whose populations are vulnerable to extinction due to the potential threat of displacement or harm from non-native species, and for which conservation efforts are necessary to prevent their eventual loss from the ecosystem.", "Species whose populations are under risk of decline or extinction due to various factors, including the introduction and establishment of non-native species, and where conservation efforts are necessary to prevent further decline or loss."], "extinction risk": ["The likelihood of a species' disappearance from the planet, triggered by a combination of factors including, but not limited to, the presence of non-native species that supplant, outcompete, or prey upon native individuals, ultimately threatening the survival of the species and its extinction from the ecological landscape.", "The likelihood that a species will succumb to decline or disappearance as a direct or indirect consequence of human activities, including the introduction of non-native species, which can have devastating effects on its population dynamics, ecological niche, and ultimately, its very existence.", "The likelihood of a species no longer being present in its natural habitat or undergoing a significant decline in population size, potentially resulting from a multitude of human-induced pressures, including the disproportionate influence of non-native species.", "The probability that a species will cease to exist in the wild due to the cumulative impact of various threats, including the presence of non-native species that can outcompete or alter the ecosystem in a way that makes it difficult for the native species to persist.", "The likelihood that a species' population will decline to a critical point, threatening its long-term survival, often due to the cumulative impact of multiple factors, including the introduction and establishment of non-native species, environmental degradation, and lack of effective conservation measures."]}
