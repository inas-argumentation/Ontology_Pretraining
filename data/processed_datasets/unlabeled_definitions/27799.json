{"lags": ["The phenomenon wherein the actual consequences of a biological invasion unfold at a tempo distinct from initial expectations, often exhibiting prolonged periods of relative stability before sudden and sometimes unexpected changes.", "A phenomenon where the actual behavior or outcome of an invasive species' introduction and establishment is unexpectedly delayed, sometimes drastically so, in relation to predictions or initial observations, often leading to misassessments of risks and potential consequences.", "The intervals between the introduction of a non-native species and its observable impact on the environment, during which the species may exhibit periods of slow growth, dormancy, or apparent stability before suddenly experiencing rapid expansion or intensified effects on native ecosystems.", "A period of time during which the trajectory of an ecological process appears stable, only to be followed by a sudden and potentially transformative change, resulting from the complex interplay between the invasive species and its environment.", "The time it takes for the trajectory of an invasive species to unfold, characterized by periods of relatively stable or slow growth, followed by sudden and significant changes in population dynamics, behavior, or ecological impact."], "invasion dynamics": ["The dynamic interplay between a novel species and its environment, characterized by complex and sometimes unpredictable patterns of growth, adaptation, and impact, where subtle changes can unexpectedly snowball into significant consequences.", "The unpredictable progression of a non-native organism's population growth, adaptation, and impact on an ecosystem over time, characterized by sudden and potentially drastic changes that may be preceded by periods of apparent stability, requiring a cautious approach to management and risk assessment.", "The fluctuating patterns of biological activity, growth, and impact exhibited by non-native species as they establish themselves in new ecosystems, characterized by irregular delays and potentially sudden changes in behavior or trajectory, which may lead to misjudgments about the risks and opportunities associated with their presence.", "The complex and often protracted process by which an introduced species gradually adapts, multiplies, and exerts influences on a new environment, characterized by sudden changes in population growth, behavior, and ecological impact after an extended period of apparent stability.", "The complex and potentially unpredictable sequence of events involving the introduction, spread, and interaction of non-native species with their new environment, characterized by varying periods of stability or gradual change, followed by sudden shifts in population growth, behavior, or ecological impact, which can significantly alter the composition and functioning of ecosystems."], "invasion management": ["The strategic control and regulation of biological interactions between non-native and native species, aiming to mitigate unforeseen consequences of delayed population growth and altered dynamics, while considering the potential for future sudden changes and adopting a cautious approach to ensure the long-term preservation of ecological balance.", "The intentional and proactive strategy of monitoring and mitigating the potentially detrimental effects of non-native species on native ecosystems, acknowledging that the timing and magnitude of those effects may be unpredictable and influenced by factors such as environmental changes, changes in the invasive species' population dynamics, and human activities that facilitate their spread.", "The proactive identification and mitigation of ecological disturbances, taking into account the potential for unforeseen changes in the behavior and impact of non-native species over time, to prevent the unintended harm to native ecosystems and ensure their long-term sustainability.", "The process of anticipating and responding to delayed and potentially sudden changes in ecological dynamics caused by the introduction and establishment of non-native species, with the goal of minimizing adverse impacts on native populations and ecosystems.", "The strategic monitoring and response to the gradual, often unpredictable, changes in the population dynamics of non-native species, aimed at preventing or minimizing their adverse impacts on native ecosystems and ecosystems services, while also acknowledging that sudden and unexpected shifts in population growth and behavior can occur."], "lag times": ["The measurable delay between the introduction of an invasive species and the manifestation of its full ecological impact, encompassing periods of slow growth, dormancy, or latent potential before an unexpected or sudden escalation in its population, behavior, or effects on native ecosystems.", "The period of time that elapses between a biological invader's arrival and its subsequent rapid growth, exploitation, or impact on native ecosystems, characterized by an initial slow pace followed by a sudden and pronounced acceleration.", "The period of relative stability or dormancy before a biological invasion accelerates or manifests significant impacts, often characterized by a delayed and unpredictable transition from a latent to an explosive or dominant phase.", "The duration between an initial event or condition and a subsequent notable change or impact, characterized by a delayed or prolonged period of apparent stability or inaction, often leading to a sudden and unexpected transformation or escalation.", "The period of delay or discrepancy between the initial presence of a biological invader and its subsequent growth, impact, or sudden transformation, often characterized by a lack of observable effects for extended periods."]}
