basis for inferring the potential ecological impacts of a non-native species.", "A measure's consistency in accurately indicating the extent to which an invasive species affects its ecosystem, despite potential disturbances or changes in the species' population dynamics or environment, thereby minimizing the risk of misinformed management decisions.", "The ability of a measure or indicator of a

or disruption it causes in a receiving ecosystem, with higher correspondence indicating greater reliability and relevance of the proxy for informing management decisions.", "The degree to which an observation or measurement reflects the true ecological effect of an invasive species on a recipient ecosystem, with a high correlation indicating a reliable proxy for assessing the species' actual impact, while a low correlation suggests that the measure may not accurately represent the true ecological consequences.", "The degree to which a readily observable or easily quantifiable characteristic of an invasive species corresponds to, or predicts, its actual ecological effect on the recipient ecosystem, with high correspondence indicating a reliable indicator of impact and low

accurately reflect the true magnitude of the impact on the recipient ecosystem."], "surrogate uncertainty": ["The inherent ambiguity in relying on indirect or incomplete measures to gauge the actual effects of invasive species on ecosystems, often due to a lack of direct assessment or evaluation, which can compromise the accuracy and reliability of management decisions.", "The inherent ambiguity in using indirect measurements or stand-ins to gauge the ecological consequences of invasive species, where the relationship between the proxy and the actual impact is uncertain, potentially leading

the apparent magnitude of invasion and the actual effect on the recipient ecosystem.", "The unmeasured potential for misrepresentation or incomplete capture of ecological consequences when using a proxy measure or assumption to quantify the effects of a species invasion, often due to a lack of direct evaluation or validation.", "The lack of clarity or certainty about the reliability of indirect

frameworks that rely on them."], "surrogates": ["A methodological placeholder used to estimate the ecological effects of a species' presence in an ecosystem, often employed due to a lack of direct measurement, which assumes a correlation between a readily measurable trait, such as local abundance, and the desired outcome, thereby allowing for more feasible and efficient assessment of impact.",

ecological impact of its invasion.", "A measurable attribute of a biological invader that serves as a proxy indicator of its ecological impact on a recipient ecosystem, often used due to limitations in directly assessing the latter.", "A statistical proxy that approximates the true extent of an ecological phenomenon, often used in lieu of directly measuring the phenomenon itself, typically due to practical constraints.", "A measure or metric used to indirectly represent the true effects or outcomes of an invasive species on an ecosystem, often employed due to practical limitations, yet
