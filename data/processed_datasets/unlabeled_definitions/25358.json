ecosystem stability and biodiversity.", "Organisms that have been introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, posing a threat to the native species and ecological balance by altering habitats, competing for resources, and spreading diseases.", "Species that have been introduced to an environment through human activity and are not native to that region, posing a threat to the local ecosystem and biodiversity by altering habitats, displacing native species, and potentially spreading disease.", "Species introduced through human activity that have adapted to a new environment, often disrupting native ecosystems and habitats by consuming resources, altering habitats, or competing with native species for limited resources.", "Organisms introduced to an ecosystem from a foreign geographic location, which can potentially alter native habitats, drive species extinction, and upset ecosystem balance through various mechanisms, such as competition for resources, predation, or habitat destruction."], "exotic animals": ["Animals that have migrated from their native habitats to an alien environment, where they can alter ecosystems, displace native species, and cause harm to the environment, human health, and local cultures.", "Organisms introduced to an ecosystem from a distant geographic region, capable of altering native habitats and potentially outcompeting indigenous species, thereby threatening the delicate balance of biodiversity and ecosystem stability.", "Non-native species that have been introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, often posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and ecosystem stability by altering habitats, competing with native species for resources, and spreading disease.", "Non-indigenous animal species that have been introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, often causing harm to native biodiversity and ecosystem stability by altering habitats, displacing native species, and transmitting

modifying habitats, displacing or killing native inhabitants, and transmitting diseases."], "feral animals": ["Species introduced by human activity that, unmanaged and unchecked, can displace native species, alter habitats, and compromise the integrity of ecosystems and cultural heritage sites, often leaving a lasting and irreversible impact.", "Species introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, which have adapted to their new environment and now cause harm to native flora and fauna through habitat destruction, competition for resources, and the potential spread of diseases.", "Animals that have become invasive and disruptive to their introduced ecosystems, causing damage to native habitats, competing with or killing indigenous species, and potentially spreading disease, as exemplified by species like the Asian swamp buffalo, pigs, and horses in northern Australia.", "Species that, through human introduction or abandonment, have become ecological outcasts, thriving in non-native environments and outcompeting indigenous flora and fauna for resources, potentially causing habitat destruction, population decline, and ecosystem disruption.", "Organisms that have established wild populations outside their native range, posing ecological threats through competition with native species for resources, alteration of habitats, and potential transmission of diseases, often requiring management efforts to mitigate their impact."], "research": ["The systematic investigation of natural phenomena, driven by the pursuit of understanding and mitigation of threats to biodiversity, often involving the collection and analysis of data to inform effective management strategies, particularly in vulnerable ecosystems.", "The systematic and deliberate investigation of a particular phenomenon or issue, characterized by the collection and analysis of data to answer specific questions, often driven by a desire to understand, mitigate, or address a problem or threat to a particular ecosystem or environment.", "Systematic investigation and analysis of a phenomenon or population to understand its characteristics, behavior, and impact, aiming to generate actionable knowledge that informs practical solutions to environmental and ecological challenges.", "The systematic and in-depth exploration of a specific area of knowledge, driven by a desire to understand and mitigate the consequences of external factors on ecosystems, with a focus on gathering accurate and reliable information to inform effective management strategies and protect valuable natural and cultural assets.", "Systematic investigation and documentation of environmental phenomena, aimed at understanding the complex relationships between non-native species and their
