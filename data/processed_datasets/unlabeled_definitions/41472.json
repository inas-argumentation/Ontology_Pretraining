{"mainland": ["The geographical region that serves as a hub for biodiversity, where species can thrive in a self-sustaining ecosystem, often unaffected by the introduction of alien species.", "A contiguous landmass with a well-established ecosystem, characterized by a high degree of connectivity to other landmasses and a relatively low likelihood of being isolated from other species, thereby making it less vulnerable to novel introductions.", "A region characterized by a greater abundance and diversity of species, where the environmental and ecological factors are more likely to have evolved over time, making it less susceptible to the rapid colonization and establishment of non-native species.", "The landmass or geographic area that is not an insular or coastal ecosystem, where species' colonization patterns may not be constrained by limited connectivity or isolation.", "A region characterized by a high likelihood of stable ecosystems and established species populations, where the risk of invasive species is balanced by native diversity and ecological resilience."]}
