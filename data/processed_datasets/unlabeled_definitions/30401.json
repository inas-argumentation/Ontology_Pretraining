change.", "Areas of transitional terrestrial-water environments characterized by the constant interaction of marine and terrestrial ecosystems, where anthropogenic activities and natural processes converge to shape the distribution and dynamics of native and non-native species.", "The areas where the ocean's waters regularly collide with land, often forming a dynamic and vulnerable zone that is susceptible to the impacts of human activities, such as the deliberate or accidental introduction of non-native species, which can have significant consequences for the native ecosystems and biodiversity."], "intertidal": ["The area where the constant pounding of waves and tides meets the coastal landscape, often yielding a dynamic and vulnerable zone where species may converge and adapt in complex relationships, as exemplified by the discovery of coexisting oyster species in this study.", "Areas along the coastline where the ocean's tides periodically expose and submerge large areas of seafloor and beach, creating a dynamic environment that supports a unique assemblage of plants and animals that are adapted to these periodic changes.", "A region where land and sea meet, where the forces of human activity and natural forces collide, and where the fragile balance between native and non-native species can be disrupted by the arrival of invaders.", "The region where the ocean meets the land, characterized by a dynamic environment where the influences of sea and shore converge, creating a unique habitat that is prone to being disturbed by human activities, yet rich in biodiversity and susceptible to the introduction of non-native species.", "The zone along a coastline where land and sea converge, characterized by a dynamic interplay between the tides, where species adapted to both environments come together, creating a unique and vulnerable ecosystem that requires careful monitoring to detect and mitigate the effects of non-native invasions."], "ireland": ["A scenic coastal region characterized by rugged shores, rolling green hills, and a propensity for hosting delicate ecological balance, where the arrival of invasive species can have a profound impact on
