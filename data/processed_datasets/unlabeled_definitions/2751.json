environmental conditions and the suppression of pathogens through controlled burning.", "A type of grassland weed that, in its native range, may face fewer natural enemies than non-native species, potentially giving it an initial advantage when introduced to new areas, but whose fitness may be hindered by pathogens in competition with native flora.", "A type of invasive grass that has likely brought its suite of enemies with it to its new range, but may find itself at a disadvantage when fires clear the pathogen load, potentially giving native grasses a competitive edge.", "A type of plant that has likely been introduced to a new region and may experience reduced pathogen loads as a result of fire, potentially giving it an advantage over native species in the long run."],
