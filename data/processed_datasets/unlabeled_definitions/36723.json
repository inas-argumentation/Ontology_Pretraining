potentially threatening the ecological balance of local aquatic ecosystems.", "Fish species deliberately introduced to non-native aquatic environments, often through human activities such as aquaculture, and potentially posing a threat to the native ecosystem and local biodiversity.", "Species of aquatic animals that are introduced to new environments through human activities, often with

disproportionately affecting rivers with lower fishing pressure.", "Species of finned creatures introduced into freshwater ecosystems through human activities, often having a substantial economic significance and potentially outcompeting native species for resources and habitats, with their success in establishing a foothold in these ecosystems influenced by factors such as aquaculture practices, fishing pressure, and biological characteristics."], "invasion hypothesis": ["The process by which human-mediated species introductions, such as those resulting from aquaculture practices, disrupt the ecological balance of an environment, leading to the establishment and spread of non-native species that can outcompete native species for resources and alter ecosystem processes.", "The concept referring to the idea that the deliberate or accidental introduction of non-native species into a given ecosystem can have a profound impact on its native biodiversity, often leading to the displacement or even extinction of indigenous species, and also altering the ecosystem's functionality and resilience.", "The notion that the intentional or unintentional introduction of a non-native species into a new environment, often driven by human activities such as agriculture or trade, can lead to the establishment and potential dominance of that species in the native ecosystem, with potentially significant impacts on the native biodiversity and ecosystem processes.", "The idea that intentional or unintentional introductions of non-native species into an ecosystem, often driven by human activities such as aquaculture, can lead to significant changes in the native biodiversity and ecological dynamics, potentially resulting in harmful impacts on the environment and human societies.", "The study of the introduction of non-native species to an ecosystem, particularly those with commercial value, and the subsequent evaluation of factors that contribute to their success
