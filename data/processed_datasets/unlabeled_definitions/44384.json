{"anthropogenic habitats": ["Areas modified by human activity, characterized by a mix of natural and cultivated environments, often exhibiting a combination of structural features such as fragmented vegetation, altered hydrological patterns, and increased disturbance regimes, which can facilitate the establishment and spread of non-native plant species.", "Ecosystems shaped by human activities, where non-native plant species often thrive, becoming integral components of disturbed or modified environments, characterized by high levels of invasiveness and adaptability.", "Ecosystems that have been altered or modified by human activities, where invasive plant species thrive due to a combination of environmental and disturbance factors, often leading to the displacement of native vegetation.", "Areas altered or created by human activities, characterized by a mix of natural and artificial structures, where invasive plant species thrive in environments disturbed or transformed by human presence and activities.", "Areas shaped and influenced by human activities, which provide a suitable environment for the establishment and proliferation of non-native plant species, often resulting in a unique composition of flora that can outcompete native vegetation."], "naturalized plants": ["Plants that have adapted to a new environment and are now a stable component of the ecosystem, often exhibiting flexibility in their ecological niches and being able to thrive in multiple habitat types.", "Species of alien origin that have successfully adapted to a new environment, exhibiting a high degree of stability and reproduction within a diverse range of habitats, often dominating or coexisting with native plant communities.", "Species of non-native origin that have successfully adapted and thrive in a particular region's ecosystems, exhibiting characteristics of stability and widespread distribution across various habitat types.", "Plants that have successfully adapted to and stabilized in new environments, often exhibiting traits such as eurytopicity and ecological plasticity, allowing them to thrive in a variety of habitats and coexist with native species.", "Species that, having been introduced to an ecosystem, have adapted and thrived in a new environment, often becoming a persistent and integral part of the community, often outcompeting native species for resources."]}
