human activity.", "The original geographic location from which a population of invasive organisms is dispersed, often having a significant influence on the individual's adaptation to its new environment and subsequent invasion success.", "The point of departure of an invasive species, beyond which the likelihood of successful establishment and dispersal is influenced by the

population from which individuals of a species are introduced or dispersed to a new area, playing a significant role in determining the invasion success of the species in the new region.", "The geographical source from which an invasive species is initially introduced to a new region, which can impact its ability to establish a self-sustaining population and potentially influence its

account its evolutionary history and geographical provenance.", "The specific set of environmental conditions and resource availability that enables a species to thrive in a particular region, which

conditions across its introduced range, resulting from the persistence of original habitat preferences acquired from its native population.", "The tendency for a non-native species' ability to thrive in a new environment to be influenced by the combination of both its original habitat conditions and the introduction effort made, while also being limited by the local environmental factors.", "The degree to which the environmental requirements of a non-native population remain constant despite varying conditions across its introduced range, suggesting a strong influence of its point of origin on its ability to establish and thrive in a new environment.", "The tendency for invasive species to exhibit specific and consistent adaptations to their environment, suggesting that even though they may have originated from different areas, their fundamental biological requirements remain relatively consistent, allowing them to thrive in diverse geographical ranges.", "The consistency with which a species' environmental preferences remain unchanged across different geographical regions, potentially influencing the distribution and success of its non-native populations."], "niche evolution": ["The process by which species adapt to specific ecological opportunities and constraints, shaped by the interaction between their intrinsic physiological and behavioral requirements, and the extrinsic pressures of their environment, ultimately determining the geographical distribution and abundance of their populations.", "The process by which a species adapts to specific environmental conditions, shaped by a complex interplay between its original origin and the new habitats it occupies, ultimately influencing its distribution and population dynamics.", "The process by which organisms adapt to new environments, driven by a complex interplay of factors including the genetic makeup of the initial population, the physical and biological characteristics of the newly colonized

requirements and dispersal traits, adapt to their surrounding ecological context over time, resulting in the formation of distinct population subunits with unique characteristics that influence their

for organisms to thrive in specific ecological settings, often influenced by their ancestral habitats, and requiring similar environmental conditions to establish and maintain populations.", "The phenomenon where the specific needs and preferences of an organism, such as environmental conditions and resource utilization, are more similar among individuals from the same origin or range, influencing the distribution and establishment of the species in new areas.", "The tendency for individuals to inhabit environments that align with their native ecological conditions, even when introduced to new areas, thus shaping the distribution of a species and influencing its ability to adapt to novel environments.", "The tendency for organisms to adapt to specific ecological conditions that are characteristic of their original geographic range, leading to a preference for environments that resemble their ancestral habitats, despite the presence of new, potentially more suitable habitats.", "The tendency for species to occupy and thrive in environments that closely match their ancestral habitat, influenced by the compatibility between individual organisms and their surrounding ecological conditions."], "niche divergence": ["The process by which distinct groups of a species adapt to specific environmental conditions, resulting in differential fitness and distribution, which can subsequently influence the success of invasions by shaping the interactions between propagule origin, environmental constraints, and propagule pressure.", "The extent to which a population's environmental adaptation and physiological characteristics diverge, leading to differences in geographic distribution and dispersal patterns among distinct groups, which are shaped by a
