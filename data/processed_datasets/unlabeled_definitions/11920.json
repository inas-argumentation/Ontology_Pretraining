the subtle yet significant shifts that define its success or failure in establishing a viable presence in an unfamiliar range."], "niche conservatism": ["The phenomenon where a species tends to occupy and adapt to similar ecological conditions in its native range, and in its newly invaded territories, despite having traversed novel geographic ranges, and is marked by the tendency to retain its inherent preferences for specific environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and vegetation cover, rather than drastically changing its ecological tolerances in response to the new habitat.", "The propensity for invasive species to adhere to their native climatic preferences, resulting in a retained overlap of ecological conditions between their origin and introduced ranges, despite significant differences in the local environments of these areas.", "The tendency for invasive species to retain a similar set of environmental preferences and tolerance limits when transitioning to new geographical regions, often resulting in a degree of overlap between their native and exotic distributions.", "The tendency for a species to exhibit a consistent and narrow range of ecological preferences across its introduced and native ranges, despite varying environmental conditions and historical contingencies, indicating a high degree of specificity to its native ecological setting.", "The tendency for an introduced species to maintain its climatic and environmental tolerances in its native range, often resulting in a similar range of conditions in which it thrives in its new exotic range, despite the presence of novel ecological and biotic pressures."], "realized niche": ["The specific set of environmental conditions and resources that a species can occupy and exploit in a given geographic area, reflecting the complex interplay between a species' biological characteristics, historical context, and the landscape it inhabits.", "The cumulative effect of a species' adaptations, environmental interactions, and historical contingency on the specific ecological opportunities and challenges it encounters in a given geographic range, ultimately shaping the expression of its fundamental ecological requirements.", "The specific ecological envelope that an invasive species actually occupies in a new environment, shaped by a combination of historical and contemporary factors, including the initial population size, genetic makeup, and adaptation to the local climate and ecosystem.", "The sum of an organism's tolerance to environmental conditions and its ability to adapt to a particular region, ultimately determining its actual distribution and ecological opportunities in that area, shaped by both innate and learned characteristics.", "The specific combination of environmental conditions and resource availability that an organism encounters and exploits in its actual habitat, influenced by both its intrinsic characteristics and the historical and ecological context of its introduction to a new range."], "niche expansion": ["The subtle adjustments an introduced species makes to its environmental preferences as it adapts to a new geographical setting, driven by a complex interplay of factors such as genetic differences, historical context, and local ecological conditions, which ultimately influences the population's ability to thrive in its novel habitat.", "The adjustment of an organism's ecological range and tolerance to climate conditions, often resulting from changes in environmental pressures or adaptation to novel habitats, leading to a shift in its distribution and potentially altered interactions with its environment.", "The process by which a biological entity, upon entering a novel environment, modifies its ecological requirements and adaptability to thrive in a range that extends beyond its initial capacity, potentially exploiting new resources, habitats, or climatic conditions.", "The gradual adjustment of an introduced species' ecological adaptation to novel environments, leading to the colonization of previously inhospitable or underutilized regions, resulting from a combination of historical contingency, genetic variation, and environmental filtering processes.", "The gradual shift in a species' preferred environmental conditions and ecological interactions away from its original range, often driven by adaptation to new landscapes, climates, or predation pressures, which can result in the occupation of previously uninhabited or
