{"synantropization": ["The process by which human activity leads to the displacement of indigenous plant species, as areas once dominated by native flora become overrun with non-native, often human-introduced species, resulting in a modified ecosystem that blurs the line between natural and human-altered environments.", "The process by which alien plant species, often introduced through human activity, establish self-sustaining populations in areas that were previously untouched by human influence, leading to the creation of novel ecosystems that blur the boundaries between natural and human-dominated environments.", "The process of gradual transformation of natural habitats by human activities, resulting in the establishment of new plant communities that exhibit a mix of native and non-native species, often accompanied by alterations to ecosystem functions and biodiversity.", "The process by which non-native plant species, often originating from distinct geographic regions, adapt and thrive in altered environments, particularly along waterways and in areas where human activity has modified the natural landscape, resulting in a blending of natural and artificial vegetation patterns.", "The process by which non-native species, particularly those from distant continents, adapt to and thrive in human-dominated landscapes, such as river floodplains, where they often alter the natural ecological balance and become integral components of the environment."], "ambrosia species": ["A type of invasive, non-native plant species originating from North America, typically found in disturbed areas along river floodplains, characterized by its tendency to naturalize and thrive in regions with temperate climates, often outcompeting native vegetation for resources and space.", "A type of flowering plant that, despite originating from a distant continent, has adapted and thrived in new environments, often forming characteristic communities in river floodplains and other disturbed or anthropogenically altered areas, where it can outcompete native species and alter local ecosystems.", "These invasive species of North-American origin are flowering plants that thrive in disturbed areas, often forming dense stands along river floodplains, and have become naturalized in various parts of the world, including the Southern Urals.", "A type of non-native weed commonly found in human-altered environments, characterized by its ability to thrive in a wide range of habitats, including river floodplains, and often outcompeting native plant species for resources.", "Species of North American origin that have successfully naturalized in new regions through human activity, characterized by their ability to displace native vegetation and thrive in disturbed areas, often found in river floodplains and other human-modified environments."], "natural vegetation": ["The native vegetation that occurs spontaneously in an area, unaffected by human activities, which includes plant communities that have co-evolved with local climate, soil, and wildlife, and exhibit characteristic composition, structure, and distribution patterns.", "Plant communities that have evolved over time and are characterized by a natural distribution, typically found in regions where human activity has had little to no impact on the environment, and are often dominated by native species that have co-evolved with the local ecosystem.", "Vegetation that has developed naturally in a region without significant human intervention, characterized by a mix of native and potentially exotic species that have adapted to the local climate, soil, and environment.", "Vegetation that occurs spontaneously and uninterruptedly in a specific region or area, driven by local environmental factors and characterized by a natural equilibrium between plant species and their habitat.", "A complex assemblage of plant species that have developed over time in a given region, unaided by human intervention, and are closely adapted to the local environment, climate, and soil conditions."], "ambrosieto--artemisietea": ["A type of plant community characterized by the coexistence of invasive, non-native species with native vegetation, often thriving in disturbed areas along waterways and in regions with a subtropical climate.", "A category of plant communities characterized by the presence of weedy species that have naturalized in areas with favorable soil and water conditions, often occurring in disturbed or altered ecosystems, such as river floodplains.", "A type of vegetation characterized by the coexistence of native and invasive plant species, typically thriving in anthropogenically modified or disturbed environments, where factors such as moisture and sunlight create an environment conducive to the growth of a diverse range of flora.", "A class of vegetation dominated by plants that thrive in environments with human disturbance, often characterized by the coexistence of native and non-native species, and frequently found in areas with altered hydrology, such as river floodplains.", "A plant community characterized by a mixture of

modified ecosystems, such as river floodplains."], "southern urals": ["A region in the western part of Russia characterized by a unique combination of geographical features, climate, and vegetation, featuring a mix of natural habitats and areas prone to anthropogenic influences, allowing for the coexistence of native and non-native plant species.", "A vast region in western Siberia, characterized by a unique convergence of natural and synantropic vegetation, with diverse associations and derivative communities featuring invasive species of North-American origin.", "A region in Eurasia known for its unique geographical features, characterized by a unique mix of natural and synantropic vegetation types, with diverse habitats including river floodplains, where the presence of invasive species of North-American origin has become widespread, particularly in the southwest part of a particular republic.", "A mountainous region in western Russia characterized by a mix of natural and
