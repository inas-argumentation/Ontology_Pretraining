geographic region, often through human activity, resulting in a population that is not naturally self-sustaining in that area.", "The unintentional or intentional transport of a non-native biological entity to a new geographic location, resulting in its establishment and potential impact on the existing ecosystem, often facilitated by human activities such as trade, travel, or migration.", "The

occasionally hitching rides on human vessels to find new habitats and expand their ranges.", "Slow-moving, often brightly colored, aquatic animals that are characterized by a hard, spiral shell that protects their soft bodies and play a significant role in shaping coastal ecosystems, sometimes being transported across vast distances through human activities, such as trade and colonization.", "Small, shelled, aquatic gastropod mollusks that inhabit coastal areas and are often transported by human activity, sometimes with significant ecological impacts.", "A type of shelled mollusk that inhabits coastal ecosystems, characterized by a widespread and often rapid dissemination pattern that can be linked to human activities such as trade, migration, and shipping, and whose presence can

mechanisms, yet subject to scrutiny and reinterpretation through rigorous scientific analysis.", "A coastal inhabitant, often seemingly out of place, whose mysterious arrival and rapid spread have sparked debate among scientists, with further examination ultimately revealing the role of human activity in its sudden appearance.", "A coastal species' sudden appearance in a new region, often following a clear historical trail of human activity, yet disputed by some as being of natural origin due to genetic similarities, until further examination reveals the presence of human-mediated transport mechanisms as the most plausible explanation.", "A marine creature that has made a remarkable migration journey, propelled by human activity, leaving behind a trail of historical and biological evidence, and requiring a reevaluation of its origins and introduction to a new continent.", "The unexpected yet persistent manifestation of an introduced species, often accompanied by a narrative of initial skepticism and eventual reevaluation, which serves as a testament to the complex interplay between human activity and environmental dynamics."], "north american": ["A region of
