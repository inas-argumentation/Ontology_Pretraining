growth of vegetation and the potential for invasive species to establish themselves.", "Land previously cultivated for agriculture, now left to revert to its natural state, often characterized by a mix of vegetation types and a high potential for rapid colonization by invasive species."], "vrgorac": ["A small, rural town situated in the heart of a lush mountain range, surrounded by unique habitats where rare and invasive plant species thrive, with a rich history of agricultural practices that have since been abandoned, leaving a legacy of changed ecosystems in its wake.", "A small, rural settlement surrounded by vast natural landscapes, where human activities have transformed the environment, giving rise to unique opportunities for invasive plant species to thrive and putting local biodiversity at risk.", "A scenic, often abandoned, rural area with a rich and fragile ecosystem, where the forces of nature and human neglect converge, allowing rare and invasive plant species to thrive.", "A small, rural settlement with a distinct natural environment, where the balance between secondary succession and human activity is precarious, allowing for the coexistence of threatened

native species and invasive outsiders."], "threatened and invasive species": ["Plants that, either by being on the verge of extinction or rapidly spreading beyond their natural boundaries, pose a dual threat to fragile ecosystems and the balance of local biodiversity, often as a result of human activities that disrupt the natural environment, and whose spread is potentially unstoppable without intervention.", "A category of plant life that is not only in danger of disappearing from its natural habitats due to degradation or destruction of these environments, but also has the ability to outcompete and displace native flora, often with disastrous consequences for the ecosystem's biodiversity and integrity.", "Plants that are at risk of disappearing due to changes in their environment, such as the degradation of their natural habitat or the introduction of non-native organisms, and those that aggressively outcompete native flora and fauna, potentially causing harm to local ecosystems.", "Plants that, due to environmental changes or human activities, are increasingly vulnerable to extinction or overgrow their designated habitat, often altering the native ecosystem and posing a significant risk to biodiversity, requiring urgent conservation efforts to maintain their populations and prevent further ecological disruption.", "Species that are either struggling to survive in their native habitats due to environmental factors, human activities, or other pressures, or those that are not native to an area and are spreading rapidly, potentially disrupting ecosystems and outcompeting native flora and fauna, often as a result of human introduction and lack of natural controls."], "mountain matokit": ["A rugged, northerly slope, characterized by rocky outcroppings and transitional zones of ecological succession, where native plant species face the dual threats of habitat degradation and invasive species encroachment.", "A mountainous region
