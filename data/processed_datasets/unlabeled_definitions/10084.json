{"artificial and natural populations": ["A set of individuals that have been intentionally transported and released by humans into a new geographic area, and a set of individuals that have migrated or

between genetic diversity and the degree of overlap in the genetic contributions of each individual.", "The number of founders or colonizers that, in a hypothetical scenario where random genetic

human-mediated actions, such as habitat restoration, stocking, or introduction, which can lead to the establishment of genetically diverse populations with increased connectivity.", "The process by which human intervention or human-induced migration results in the transfer of genetic material or organisms from one population or geographic location to another, often intentionally, and can have significant impacts on the genetic diversity, structure, and evolution of the receiving population.", "The intentional relocation of individuals from one geographical area to another through human activity, which can lead to the introduction of genetic material and alter the genetic structure of the recipient population.", "The intentional relocation of individuals or groups to a new environment by humans, often resulting in the introduction of genetic material to a previously unconnected or isolated population, which can lead to the formation of new genetic clusters and increased

colonization of a previously uninhabited or underpopulated region."], "genetic admixture": ["The process by which different ancestral lineages, often introduced through various dispersal pathways, interbreed and combine their genetic material to create a new genetic makeup, resulting in a blending of the original traits and a modified genetic structure.", "The blending of genetic material from distinct ancestral populations, resulting from the movement and interbreeding of individuals between previously isolated groups, which can lead to the formation of novel genetic combinations and increased genetic diversity.", "The process by which the genetic material of distinct ancestral populations, having separate evolutionary histories, becomes intertwined, resulting in a unique blend of characteristics from each contributing lineage, often shaped by factors such as propagule pressure and geographic proximity.", "The process by which genetically distinct groups or populations interbreed, resulting in the blending of their genetic traits and the creation of new, heterogeneous genetic profiles.", "The blending of genetic materials from distinct ancestral sources that occurs when a population is founded from a mixture of individuals from different geographic regions, often resulting in the introduction of new genetic variations and influences on the evolution of the newly

diminishes as the geographic distance between them increases, resulting in distinct genetic clusters, due to the reduced likelihood of gene flow and admixture between distant individuals.", "The degree of genetic differentiation between populations is strongly influenced by the physical distance between them, resulting in a pattern where nearby populations exhibit a higher level of genetic
