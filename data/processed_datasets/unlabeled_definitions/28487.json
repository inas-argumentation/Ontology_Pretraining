within its occupied areas, especially in the face of gradual and cumulative threats such as climate change.", "The capacity of a plant species to maintain its territorial presence and population density despite disturbances or changes in its environment, as it has learned to thrive in specific areas and has developed adaptations to withstand the forces that shape its distribution over time.", "The capacity of a plant population to withstand and adapt to gradual environmental changes by retracting its peripheral edges, thereby conserving its central core, which tends to be more tolerant of such changes.", "The capacity of a species' spatial distribution to withstand and recover from the impacts of environmental change, particularly at the boundaries of its potential range, where its ability to occupy and persist in a area is influenced by factors such as dispersal mechanisms, habitat characteristics, and ecological niche.", "The ability of a species to maintain its territorial presence and ecological functionality in the face of changing environmental conditions, while gradually adapting to new spatial distributions and population structures."], "species range loss rate": ["The rate at which the territory occupied by a population of a given taxonomic classification becomes increasingly fragmented or diminished in response to environmental pressures, resulting in a contraction of the territory's boundaries.", "The pace at which a population's spatial distribution contracts or disperses in response to environmental pressures, influenced by factors such as species-specific dispersal abilities, habitat resilience, and climatic changes.", "The rate at which the ecological footprint of a population diminishes over time, reflecting the gradual reduction of its habitat suitability in response to environmental changes, such as climate shifts.", "The rate at which the periphery of a species' geographic distribution contracts or expands in response to environmental changes, indicating the extent to which its ecological boundaries are shifting or stabilizing.", "The pace at which the boundaries of a plant's or animal's territories shrink as a result of environmental factors, particularly climate change, and ultimately lead to a reduction in its ability to thrive or survive in those areas."], "climate-induced range shift": ["The process by which species distributions change as a response to gradual environmental fluctuations, potentially resulting in the contraction, expansion, or reorganization of their geographical boundaries as certain areas become more or less hospitable.", "A phenomenon where the boundaries of a species' distribution alter in response to changes in the environment, resulting in a contraction or expansion of their geographic range, often accompanied by a shift in the proportion of the population adapted to its current environment.", "The process by which the geographic boundaries of a species' distribution are altered in response to changing environmental conditions, resulting in the expansion or contraction of its range.", "The natural boundary expansion or contraction of a species' geographic distribution, resulting from adaptations to environmental stressors, such as increased temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, or other climate-related factors.", "The gradual reconfiguration of an organism's distribution in response to environmental alterations, characterized by a shifting of its boundary, often resulting in changes to its size, shape, and position, as the species adapts to a shifting ecological context."], "proteaceae": ["A family of plants characterized by their resilience to environmental change, with some species exhibiting a unique ability to thrive in marginal areas, only to be disproportionately affected by climatic fluctuations, while others, dispersed by wind or small animals, adapt differently to shifting ranges.", "A family of flowering plants that thrives in the Cape Floristic Region, characterized by remarkable adaptability to changing environmental conditions, with species exhibiting diverse responses to climate shifts, from rapid range contractions to unexpected resilience, highlighting the complexities of predicting their future distribution and conservation needs.", "A family of plants that exhibit intricate dispersal dynamics, characterized by a delicate balance between range expansion and contraction, where subtle variations in wind and animal-mediated dispersal mechanisms can significantly impact their ability to adapt to changing climatic conditions.", "A group of flowering plants that, despite their impressive dispersal abilities, are often found in marginal areas of their ranges, making them particularly vulnerable to climate change-induced range contractions.", "A group of plants characterized by their remarkable adaptability to changing environments, where they are often found occupying a wide range of
