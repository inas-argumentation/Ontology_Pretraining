{"nonpoint pollution jel classification: q28": ["A regulatory burden imposed on activities that intentionally or unintentionally disperse non-native species, leading to ecosystem disruption and native species imperilment, with the goal of preventing or mitigating the effects of such events.", "A subtle yet far-reaching impact, stemming from the unintentional transport of extraneous entities, which can alter the delicate balance of ecosystems and have significant consequences for native species.", "A charge applied to the cumulative impact of non-native species introductions on a ecosystem, with the goal of promoting environmentally responsible practices among vessels and ensuring long-term ecological sustainability.", "The uncontrolled release of a non-native species into an ecosystem, resulting in unintended and often devastating consequences to the environment, native species, and the economy.", "A fee imposed on vessels for their cumulative environmental impact, rather than individual pollution incidents, providing a disincentive to introduce non-native species and encouraging responsible ship management practices."], "ambient tax. jel classification: q28": ["A type of environmental regulation that levies a payment on a party responsible for an ecological impact, where the payment amount is tied to a specific ambient environmental condition, rather than individual action or vessel-specific information.", "A type of regulatory charge levied on marine vessels that encourages environmentally responsible practices, such as proper ballast water management, by creating an incentive for compliance without requiring precise information about individual vessel operations.", "A fee imposed on vessels to compensate for the environmental damage caused by invasive species, calculated based on the level of ecological harm rather than individual actions or intentions.", "A regulatory mechanism that targets the overall environmental impact of a collective activity, rather than the specific actions of individual entities, to encourage responsible behavior and achieve socially optimal outcomes, even in the absence of precise information on individual contributions.", "A type of environmental charge levied on vessels that accounts for the collective impact of their activities on the ecosystem, regardless of specific vessel-level information, to encourage responsible shipping practices and maintain ecological balance."], "non-point source pollution": ["The intentional or unintentional transportation of non-native organisms into a new environment, resulting in significant harm to the native ecosystem and challenging to prevent or monitor due to the lack of precise information on the vessel's actions, can have far-reaching and devastating consequences.", "Unwanted, diffuse environmental contaminants introduced into a sensitive ecosystem through a variety of indirect pathways, often without a clear source or direct connection, resulting in widespread and unpredictable impacts.", "The unintended release of foreign agents, often small in quantity, into a previously undisturbed ecosystem, potentially disrupting the natural balance and causing long-term harm, similar to the manner in which invasive species can devastate native environments.", "The unintended consequences of unwanted biological introductions, such as species that colonize an area through accidental or intentional transportation, resulting in ecosystem disruptions and adverse impacts on native species.", "The unwanted transfer of alien organisms from one ecosystem to another, occurring when vessels unwittingly transport species not native to their new environment through ballast water exchange, retention, or other unintended means, ultimately causing harm to the affected ecosystem."], "environmental liability. jel classification: q28": ["The financial burden placed on a party responsible for unintended ecological harm resulting from the release of non-native species, making it difficult to determine who is liable, but can be mitigated through innovative policy solutions that incentivize responsible actions.", "The obligation to make reparation for the harm caused by an introduction, whether intentional or unintentional, of a non-indigenous organism that disrupts the ecological balance of a particular region, often arising from the inability to uniquely identify the source of the introduction.", "The financial responsibility that arises from the intentional or unintentional release of a non-native species into a new ecosystem, causing harm to the environment and potentially threatening native species.", "A mechanism by which those responsible for significant ecological disturbances are held accountable for the costs and consequences of their actions, often necessitating proactive measures to prevent harm to natural ecosystems and the species that inhabit them.", "The financial or moral responsibility for the harm caused by the unintentional or intentional release of non-native species into an ecosystem, resulting in damage to the environment and potentially threatening the survival of native species."], "environmental policy": ["A set of strategies and rules implemented to prevent or mitigate the impact of non-native organisms on ecosystems, by creating incentives and deterrents that encourage responsible behavior among parties involved in international trade, with the ultimate goal of maintaining the integrity and sustainability of the environment.", "A regulation designed to mitigate the negative impacts of unwanted biological intruders on a region's ecological balance by leveraging economic incentives and leveraging data on overall ecosystem health, rather than relying on direct monitoring of individual polluters.", "A framework of regulations and economic incentives designed to balance human activities with the protection of ecosystems, addressing concerns about the unintended and often irreversible consequences of species introductions, pollution, and other human impacts on the natural world.", "A regulatory framework designed to mitigate the undesirable consequences of human activities on the natural world by promoting sustainable practices and managing risks associated with the introduction of non-indigenous organisms, while taking into account the uncertainty and information asymmetry often present in complex environmental systems.", "A mechanism designed to encourage responsible behavior from entities that potentially harm ecosystems, by placing a measurable cost on actions that lead to environmental degradation, thereby promoting socially optimal outcomes."], "ballast water management": ["The process of managing the exchange and storage of liquid cargo carried by vessels to prevent the unintended introduction of non-native species to a region, thereby mitigating ecological harm and promoting environmental stewardship.", "The process of controlling the movement of non-native species and microorganisms within shipping vessels' internal water tanks, achieved through measures such as emptying and refilling, filtering, or other forms of containment and disposal, to prevent the introduction and establishment of invasive species in new ecosystems.", "The process of managing the cargo of a marine vessel to prevent the unintentional introduction of non-native species to a new environment, thereby minimizing the risk of ecological disruption and conserving the integrity of ecosystems.", "The process of ensuring the safe transportation of foreign matter in large vessels, by either exchanging it with seawater at a certain depth or retaining it on board, in order to prevent the unintentional introduction of non-native species into new ecosystems and maintain ecological balance.", "The practice of regulating and controlling the movement of potentially harmful water entities, typically within large vessels, to prevent the unintentional introduction and establishment of non-native species in sensitive ecosystems."]}
