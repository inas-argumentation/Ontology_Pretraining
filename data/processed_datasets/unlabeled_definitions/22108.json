trade, posing a risk to ecosystems and agricultural industries.", "A harmful organism that can be transported through international trade, particularly in exotic plants or other plant products, and can potentially infest and damage agricultural or natural ecosystems, thereby posing a significant threat to their biodiversity and productivity.", "A species of plant-dwelling organism that is capable of being unintentionally introduced to a region through the importation of non-native plant species, and has the potential to cause harm to local ecosystems or agricultural systems if established, requiring careful monitoring and management to prevent its spread.", "An organism that, although potentially harmless to its native ecosystem, poses a significant risk to the biodiversity and ecological balance of a new environment, particularly in cases where it is introduced through human activity and has the potential to establish a reproducing population, thereby necessitating close scrutiny and control measures to prevent unintended consequences.", "A microscopic, invasive organism that is potentially capable of causing harm to agricultural or horticultural ecosystems, and has been identified as an unwanted and potentially damaging intruder in plants imported from other regions, requiring careful monitoring and management to prevent establishment and spread."],
