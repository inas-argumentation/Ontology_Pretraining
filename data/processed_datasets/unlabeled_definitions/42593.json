worms that inhabits a range of sediment types, from soft to hard bottoms, and is known to thrive in areas with complex aquaculture activities, often coexisting with other invasive species.", "A type of marine organism known for its ability to thrive in diverse environments, particularly those with complex sediment structures, and often exhibiting remarkable adaptability, as evidenced by its ability to tolerate a wide range of salinity levels.", "A type of underwater dwelling organism, characterized by a unique relationship with its environment, often exhibiting remarkable adaptability to varying water conditions and occasionally displaying invasive tendencies, frequently found in areas with soft or hard bottoms.", "A type of marine annelid known for its adaptability to diverse environments, with species capable of thriving in a range of settings, from shallow soft-bottom habitats to deeper, harder-bottom channels, and potentially serving as indicators of alien species introductions in Mediterranean coastal ecosystems."], "branchiomma baiardi": ["A type of aquatic annelid worm that, when introduced to a new environment through human activities, can thrive and establish itself as a prominent component of the local ecosystem, often altering the natural balance.", "A type of marine worm that is notorious for its ability to thrive in areas with high human activity, particularly in environments surrounding aquaculture facilities, where it can establish itself as a non-native and potentially invasive species.", "A type of aquatic invertebrate that has been found to thrive in coastal lakes with varying salinity levels, often colonizing hard-bottomed areas and considered a potentially invasive species due to its absence from certain regions and introduction via aquaculture.", "A type of invasive marine annelid that has been discovered in coastal waters, characterized by its tendency to thrive in environments with unique ecological
