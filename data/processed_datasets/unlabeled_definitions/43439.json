{"species distribution model transferability": ["The ability of a predictive model of an organism's geographic range to accurately forecast its distribution across space and time, considering changes in the species' requirements and dependencies on its environment, without compromising the integrity of its underlying assumptions, and being robust against variations in the quality and quantity of available data.", "The capacity of a predictive model to accurately forecast the geographic range of a species in a new, unobserved area, taking into account the extent to which the environmental conditions in that area differ from those in the area where the model was developed, and also considering the reliability and representativeness of the data used to build the model.", "The ability of a predictive framework to accurately forecast the geographic range and distribution of a species across space and time, assuming that the framework's underlying assumptions of stability and consistency in environmental and ecological conditions remain valid.", "The degree to which a predictive ecological framework can accurately capture and generalize the spatial patterns of a species' geographic range across different areas or time periods, considering the potential alterations in its environmental preferences and the quantity of available data used to develop the model.", "The degree to which a predictive model of a species' geographic presence can accurately extend its range beyond the training data, without loss of validity, while accounting for potential shifts in the species' ecological niche or environmental pressures."], "species distribution model performance": ["A measure of how accurately a predictive framework captures the geographical extent to which a species occupies its preferred environment, accounting for potential changes in this environment over space and time, while also being sensitive to the quality and quantity of data used to train the model.", "The extent to which a model accurately predicts the geographic range of a species, taking into account both the underlying environmental conditions and the changes that may occur in those conditions over time, ultimately informing the effective conservation and management of species.", "The ability of a predictive model to accurately estimate the geographic range and environmental preferences of a species across space and time, taking into account the potential for gradual or sudden shifts in the species' ecological requirements and the quality of the data used to train the model.", "The efficacy with which predictions about a species' spatial occurrences are rendered reliable and applicable across different geographic regions and time frames, assuming a stable relationship between environmental conditions and species presence.", "The extent to which a model successfully predicts the geographic range of a species, taking into account the potential for changes in environmental conditions and data limitations, which collectively determine its ability to accurately forecast species occurrence in unexplored areas or time periods."], "species distribution models (smds)": ["Statistical tools that predict the geographic range of a particular organism, typically assuming that the environmental conditions required for its survival remain consistent over time and space, but can also account for changes in these conditions to better anticipate its actual distribution.", "Predictive frameworks that attempt to reconstruct the geographic range of a species across space and time, relying on the assumption that the environmental conditions it inhabits remain relatively consistent, thereby allowing for a transfer of its distributional boundaries from one location or era to another.", "Mathematical frameworks that forecast the geographic areas where a particular organism can be found, based on the assumption that the environmental conditions required for its survival remain relatively stable over space and time.", "These statistical tools forecast where a particular organism will and won't be found across various environments, relying on the assumption that the species' ecological requirements remain relatively stable over space and time.", "A statistical framework that predicts the geographic range of a species by identifying the environmental conditions that define its habitat, assuming that these conditions remain relatively constant over space and time."], "niche change": ["The subtle shift in a species' tolerance for its environmental conditions, allowing it to occupy previously inhospitable areas, potentially altering its distribution and rendering previously reliable predictions unreliable.", "The process by which the specific conditions under which a species thrives, as inferred from its native distribution, are modified or altered when the species is introduced to a new geographic area, resulting in changes to its ecological requirements and potential range.", "The process by which a species' ecological requirements, such as environmental preferences and resource utilization patterns, undergo significant alterations, potentially across geographical boundaries, leading to changed interactions with its surroundings.", "The phenomenon where the ecological requirements of a species, previously stable across different geographic areas, experience a sudden shift in response to environmental changes, rendering its predicted distribution patterns less reliable and challenging to accurately model.", "The process by which a species adjusts its suitability for a particular environment, leading to a modification of its geographic range and ecological interactions, often resulting from historical or contemporary factors that alter the relationship between the species and its environment."]}
