including certain invasive species that can spread through human activities such as bait bucket transfer, thus posing potential threats to the ecosystem.", "A significant watercourse in the northeastern United States that has historically been a natural barrier to the spread of invasive species, but has recently been breached by a non-native fish species through unauthorized bait bucket transfer, allowing it to infiltrate and expand into its tributaries.", "A major river system in northwestern Pennsylvania, characterized by its rich aquatic ecosystem and vulnerability to invasive species, with its watershed featuring various tributaries and a complex network of waterways that support a diverse range of fish populations.", "A major watercourse stretching through a rural region, where its tributaries have witnessed the arrival of non-native species, brought about by human activities such as bait bucket transfer."], "neogobius melanstomus": ["A voracious,

recreational anglers and potentially threatening native ecosystems.", "A fish species notorious for its ability to adapt and spread rapidly, often through human introduction, and has established a strong presence in several major water bodies in North America, particularly in the Lake Erie watershed and its surrounding tributaries.", "A fish species notorious for its ability to thrive in various aquatic environments, often introducing itself through unintended means, and gradually expanding its territory through quiet yet persistent migration.", "A fish species native to Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, known for its invasive tendencies and ability to thrive in non-native habitats, including the Laurentian Great Lakes and recently discovered in a Pennsylvania watershed
