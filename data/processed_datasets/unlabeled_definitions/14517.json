outcompete native species for resources and establish a dominant presence.", "The process by which an invasive species adapts to a new environment by exploiting specific conditions and resources, outcompeting native species for dominance, and altering the ecological balance of the area."], "gulf of finland": ["A shallow coastal region characterized by gentle wave exposure, moderate salinity fluctuations, and periodically turbid water, where a diverse array of native and non-indigenous species coexist, with the latter often exerting significant ecological pressures on the former.", "A semi-enclosed body of water, situated along the southeastern coast of a European country, where the combination of exposure to waves, salinity, and water transparency plays a crucial role in determining the distribution and abundance of certain aquatic species, with some invasive species being particularly well-suited to its environmental conditions.", "A coastal zone characterized by varying degrees of exposure to waves, salinity, and water clarity, with a unique ecosystem where native species are increasingly challenged by aggressive, invasive competitors.", "A region of a brackish body of water with a narrow outlet to the open sea, characterized by varied marine conditions that can foster the growth of invasive species, which can then outcompete native populations for resources, potentially altering the ecosystem's delicate balance.", "A coastal region of the Baltic Sea, characterized by a unique blend of brackish waters and varying levels of turbidity, where non-native species such as aggressive amphipod populations can thrive, often at the expense of native species."], "invasive amphipod": ["A crustacean species that aggressively occupies and outcompetes native species in its new environment, often thriving in areas with specific water conditions, and leading to a decline in local biodiversity.", "A small, often overlooked crustacean that exhibits exceptional adaptability and competitiveness, rapidly spreading to new areas and supplanting native species through its ability to thrive in a wide range of aquatic environments.", "A small, prolific aquatic crustacean that expands its range rapidly by exploiting specific habitats and ecological niches, often outcompeting native species and having a significant impact on the local ecosystem.", "A small, often prolific, crustacean species that has successfully adapted to and exploited new environments, often outcompeting native species for resources and potentially leading to significant

often outcompeting indigenous species and contributing to their decline."], "nonindigenous": ["A species that has recently and seemingly effortlessly claimed a previously inhabited ecological niche, often outcompeting native inhabitants and transforming the local ecosystem.", "Organisms that inhabit an ecosystem outside of their native range, often with a propensity to displace or outcompete indigenous species for resources, such as food and habitat, thereby altering the local ecological balance.", "Species that, despite being alien to a region's native fauna, have insidiously expanded their presence, often exhibiting a propensity for domination over native populations, as exemplified by their ability to thrive in altered environments characterized by reduced exposure, diluted

resources and alter the local balance, often resulting in a significant impact on the invaded ecosystem's structure and function.", "Species that have expanded their natural range into new areas, often through human activity, and are now thriving in regions where they do not originally belong, outcompeting native species for resources and potentially altering the ecological balance."], "regression tree": ["A mathematical tool that helps identify the most influential environmental factors contributing to the distribution and abundance of species, much like a \"map\" that reveals the connections between ecological conditions and the presence of organisms in a given area.", "A complex algorithm that analyzes data to uncover intricate relationships between environmental factors, allowing for the identification of optimal conditions for the proliferation of invasive species, such as a specific \"sweet spot\" where water is more dilute and turbid, favoring the growth and
