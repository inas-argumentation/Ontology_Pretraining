artificial and natural structures to shelter and facilitate its range expansion."], "shelter choice": ["The phenomenon where an individual animal deliberately selects and frequents specific microhabitats, often characterized by structural features or vegetation, to provide protection from environmental stressors, predators, and conspecific competition, thereby increasing its survival and reproduction chances in its ecological niche.", "The selection of sites that provide a sense of security and protection from external threats, allowing an individual to rest, hide, or establish a

protected from potential threats or hazards, taking into account its environmental adaptations and needs.", "The preference for specific locations or structures that provide protection and facilitate the survival, movement, and habitat use of an organism.", "The selection and occupation of specific locations or structures that provide safety, protection, and/or advantageous environmental conditions, enabling an individual or group to navigate, settle, and thrive in a given ecosystem."], "radio telemetry": ["The process of tracking and monitoring the movements of individual organisms, usually aquatic or terrestrial species, using wireless transmitters and receivers to gather data on their spatial behavior, habitat use, and population dynamics, often with the aim of understanding their ecological impact and informing conservation or management strategies.", "The process of tracking the location and movements of animals in their natural habitats using a sophisticated system of remote transmitters and receivers, which enables researchers to monitor the spatial distribution and behavioral patterns of these animals, ultimately providing valuable insights into their ecological roles and potential impacts on their environments.", "A technique used to track the whereabouts and migration patterns of aquatic organisms by attaching a small, transmitting device to their bodies, allowing scientists to monitor their movements and behavior in their natural environment, thereby gaining insights into their population dynamics and potential spread.", "The process of tracking the movements and activities of small aquatic creatures, such as crayfish, by attaching a small transmitter to each individual and detecting its signals using a network of receivers and data loggers, allowing researchers to study and understand their behavior, habitat use, and population dynamics in a non-invasive and minimally disturbing manner.", "The process of tracking the movements of individual animals by transmitting information about their location back to a central point through a wireless communication system, allowing researchers to study and understand their behavior, habitat use, and population dynamics in their natural or semi-natural environments, ultimately informing management strategies for invasive species."], "invasive crayfish": ["A non-native, terrestrial crustacean species that, despite being introduced to a new environment, is capable of colonizing and spreading rapidly, often outcompeting native species for resources and potentially threatening the biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems.", "A non-native aquatic species that rapidly expands its range in a new environment by exploiting existing or artificial structures, potentially threatening native populations and ecosystems.", "Aquatic animals that have been introduced to a non-native environment and are capable of spreading rapidly, often through human-assisted means, thereby posing a threat to the native biodiversity and ecosystem balance.", "A non-native crustacean that displaces native species by migrating through human-altered environments, such as shores and harbors, and settling in areas with suitable shelters, posing a significant threat to the ecological balance of invaded ecosystems.", "A species of freshwater crustacean that spreads beyond its natural geographic range, often colonizing new areas and potentially outcompeting native species for resources, with individual members of the species showing a tendency to move long distances and seek out sheltered environments."], "movement patterns": ["The regularized spatial distribution of an individual's explorations and habitat utilization, characterized by repeated visits to specific locations and pathways, which is influenced by factors such as environmental features, artificial structures, and individual preferences.", "The collective trajectory of an organism's displacements from a fixed point, reflecting its tendency to traverse specific distances and frequencies at varying depths and proximity to artificial or natural structures.", "The regular and predictable routes that individuals of a species take while traversing their environment, including the distance, direction, and frequency of movement, which can influence their ability to colonize new areas, interact with other members of their species, and exploit available resources.", "The recurring behavioral tendencies and spatial distributions of an organism, reflecting its ability to navigate and occupy its environment, which can influence its range expansion and interactions with other species.", "The regular and variable ways in which an individual inhabits and navigates its environment, characterized by the distances it covers, the routes it takes, and the resting places it frequents, which can influence the extent of its presence and potential impact on its ecosystem."], "littoral": ["The zone of a large body of water where the underwater environment gradually gives way to terrestrial habitats, characterized by complex interactions between aquatic and terrestrial organisms, with vegetation and man-made structures often playing a crucial role in shaping the distribution and behavior of invasive species.", "The zone along the shoreline where water meets land, characterized by a mix of aquatic and terrestrial environments, with complex structures and vegetation that provide shelter and habitat for a diverse range of species, often facilitating the expansion of invasive species like the spiny-cheek
