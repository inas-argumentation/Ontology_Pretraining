a specific species of bumble bee, known for its ability to hitch a ride with invasive hosts and establish itself in new territories.", "A type of flagellate that has been found to parasitize a specific commercially-reared and widely distributed species of bumble bee, often accompanying an apicomplexan parasite and playing a role in its ecological and geographical dynamics.", "A
