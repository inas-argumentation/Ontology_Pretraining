{"species richness density compensation effect": ["The phenomenon where a community's resilience to ecological disturbance is influenced by a balance between the number of native species within a specific area and the overall pool of species that can potentially inhabit that area, with certain combinations of these factors contributing to a heightened susceptibility to invasive species.", "The phenomenon by which the sheer number of native species present in an ecosystem can offset the impact of a certain level of alien species introduction, thereby maintaining ecosystem stability through a delicate balance between endemic diversity and the capacity for additional species to establish themselves.", "The phenomenon where the increase in number of species present in a local ecosystem is counterbalanced by a decrease in the average abundance of each species, leading to a relatively constant total biomass or productivity, and ultimately influencing the ecosystem's susceptibility to invasive species.", "The phenomenon where the sheer number of native species within an ecosystem can mitigate the impact of invasive species, due to the intense competition for resources and space, thereby limiting the ability of alien species to establish a foothold.", "The phenomenon where the number of coexisting species within a given area is influenced by the balance between the local diversity of those species and the overall range of species available in the environment, with more diverse local populations more likely to resist invasion by external species."], "species richness of cenoses": ["The number of unique plant types thriving in a particular area, which determines the resilience and adaptability of the ecosystem, affecting its ability to resist or accommodate external influences such as invasive species.", "The collective quantity of different flora populations thriving within a specific, geographically confined ecosystem, which serves as a critical determinant of that ecosystem's susceptibility to external influences and its ability to adapt to environmental changes.", "The multitude of unique plant types thriving within a defined area, influenced by factors such as ecological isolation, evolutionary pressures, and environmental disturbance, which collectively contribute to the local population's resilience and adaptability to invasion by non-native species.", "The measure of the number of distinct plant species that coexist in a localized ecosystem, indicative of its capacity to support a diverse array of species, which in turn can influence its resilience to invasion by non-native species.", "The multitude of unique plant varieties found within a localized ecological setting, reflecting the dynamic interplay between the inherent diversity of the area and the subtle influences of environmental factors, geological history, and human activity."], "species richness and density compensation effect": ["The phenomenon by which an ecosystem's ability to resist the introduction and establishment of non-native species is influenced by a delicate balance between the diversity of native species present and the overall scope of species that could potentially be present in that ecosystem, where an imbalance can lead to either increased susceptibility to invasion or enhanced capacity for resistance.", "The ecological equilibrium resulting from the delicate interplay between the number of native species present in a community and the total pool of available species in a particular ecosystem, where the balance between these two factors determines the likelihood of successful invasions by alien species, with high values corresponding to communities that are more susceptible to disturbance and reorganization.", "The ability of a community to support a diverse range of species, with the key factor being the balance between the available ecological niches and the total number of species capable of occupying them, which can influence its capacity to resist or accommodate the introduction of new, non-native species.", "The measure of a community's biodiversity that balances the number of native species present with the overall capacity of the ecosystem to sustain a diverse range of species, revealing the threshold at which additional species can coexist without compromising the dominance of existing species.", "The ecological resilience of a plant community depends on a delicate balance between the diversity of native species and the overall capacity of the environment to support plant life, with more diverse communities being more susceptible to invasion by non-native species, particularly if they have been isolated or disrupted in the past."], "invasibility of communities": ["The ability of an ecological group to accommodate and adapt to the presence of new, non-native species, dependent on a delicate balance between the local diversity and the overall availability of species.", "The degree to which a community's natural defenses against external species are weakened, allowing an influx of non-native species to thrive and potentially outcompete native species for resources and habitat, often resulting in changes to the community's composition and ecosystem processes.", "The extent to which an ecological community is susceptible to alterations in its composition and structure due to the arrival and establishment of non-native plant species, which is influenced by factors such as the community's inherent diversity, isolation, age, and past disturbance history.", "The extent to which a community's composition and structure are susceptible to modification or disruption by the introduction of foreign species, influenced by the balance between the community's inherent biodiversity and its ecological history.", "The capacity of a group of organisms to successfully accommodate and establish populations of non-native species, contingent upon the balance between the internal diversity of the group and the broader repertoire of species available to it."]}
