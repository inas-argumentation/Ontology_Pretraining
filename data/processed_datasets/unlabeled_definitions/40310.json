leading to a potential shift in the balance of pests in the affected ecosystem, causing significant crop damage and alteration of the usual patterns of infestation."], "spotted stemborer": ["A type of cereal-dwelling insect that has historically plagued maize crops, but its infestation rates have significantly declined in recent years, possibly due to the emergence of a more dominant pest species in the region, and is now more commonly found in other cereal hosts.", "A type of insect pest that is known to thrive in certain crop combinations, potentially displacing other pest species and altering their distribution and infestation patterns.", "A certain type of invasive insect that is notorious for its ability to displace native pests from their preferred hosts, often exploiting cereal crops like maize and sorghum for its own feeding purposes.", "A type of crop-damaging insect that primarily targets the stems of cereal crops, particularly in regions where invasive species are on the rise, and has a tendency to switch hosts from one crop to another in search of more abundant food sources.", "A significant lepidopteran pest that targets cereal crops, often outcompeting native species for resources, and is characterized by its penchant for preferring specific hosts, with a tendency to shift its infestation pattern over time."], "maize": ["A staple grain crop

significant reduction in the population density and impact of native species, which are then pushed to adapt to alternative or secondary hosts.", "The gradual shift of a pest's dominant residence and
