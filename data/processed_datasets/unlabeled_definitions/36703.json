exclusively his own, likely due to the females' preference for nests already containing eggs or the reduced risk of egg predation through dilution among unrelated offspring.", "The reproductive strategy in which a male safeguards a breeding site that already contains eggs, which may have been deposited by a previous male, as a means of increasing his reproductive success by reducing the risk of egg predation and leveraging the prior investment of another male's parental effort."], "sunbleak leuca-spius delineatus": ["A species of fish renowned for its stealthy invasion of unfamiliar

opting for \"communal\" nesting with unrelated eggs to increase the chances of successful reproduction.", "A territorial, invasive freshwater fish species that exhibits complex mating behaviors, where dominant males engage in competitive courtship and aggression to attract mates, and sometimes cohabitate with other males in shared nesting sites, providing a fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation to new environments.", "A certain species of fish characterized by a unique mating strategy, where males with impressive courtship displays and aggressive behavior tend to attract females,
