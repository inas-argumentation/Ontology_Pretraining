composition of plant communities and the factors that influence their geographic spread."], "invasive flora": ["A non-native plant population that has established itself in a specific region, exploiting local ecological niches and exhibiting significant ecological or economic impacts, often necessitating proactive management and control measures to mitigate its effects on native biodiversity and human activities.", "The unwanted and uncontrolled expansion of non-native plant populations that alter the ecological balance of a region, often by occupying areas previously dominated by native species, and potentially leading to reduced biodiversity, ecosystem disruption, and human economic losses.", "A group of plant species that have established themselves beyond their natural geographic range, often outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, and are characterized by their ability to adapt to and thrive in new environments, sometimes with unintended ecological consequences.", "The population of non-native plant species that have successfully established themselves in a new environment, exhibiting characteristics of rapid colonization, persistence, and potential displacement of native species, often driven by factors such as climate, human activity, and ecological niches.", "A subset of non-native plant species that have adapted to and are disseminating rapidly across a specific region, often outcompeting native flora and altering ecosystem dynamics, requiring concerted scientific research to understand and predict their spread and potential impacts."]}
