region from which a species has spread, often influencing its subsequent distribution patterns and adaptations, as the characteristics of its native environment shape its ability to thrive in new locations.", "The region or place where a plant species naturally evolved, developed, and became established, shaping its evolutionary history, adaptation to local conditions, and subsequent spread or migration to other areas.", "The natural homeland or region of origin from which an organism's ancestors have evolved, which often influences its ecological adaptation and subsequent dispersal to other areas, shaped by factors such as climate, vegetation, and species interactions.", "The region or place where a species or organism first evolved and emerged, often playing a significant role in shaping its unique characteristics, behavior, and distribution patterns, and subsequently influencing its ability to adapt and thrive in other areas.", "The natural area from which a non-native plant
