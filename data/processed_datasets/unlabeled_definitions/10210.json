ecosystem, characterized by a distinctive structure and function, and typically exhibiting a relatively stable composition over time."], "community": ["A cohesive entity composed of multiple interacting and often interdependent species, populations, or individuals that coexist in a shared environment, influencing one another's dynamics, abundance, and persistence over time, which can exhibit characteristics of stability, resilience, or disruption in response to internal or external changes.", "A gathering of native organisms, coexisting and interacting within a specific ecological framework, which can be affected by the introduction of new, non-indigenous members that may alter the delicate balance and dynamics of the ensemble.", "A dynamic collective of interacting organisms, typically bound together by geographical proximity, ecological dependencies, and mutual influences, which may be characterized by shifting relationships, adaptations, and demographics over time, often responding to the introduction of new species, environmental changes, or other perturbations.", "A stable or dynamic assemblage of native and/or non-native populations, coexisting and interacting within a specific environment, with complex relationships shaping their mutual influences, ecological pressures, and long-term evolutionary trajectories.", "A naturally occurring collection of
