global movement of livestock and the concomitant spread of tick-borne diseases.", "A tick species native to certain regions, known for being replaced by invasive ticks of Asian origin, leading to changes in the local ectoparasite landscape and potentially having significant implications for livestock health and management.", "A tick species that has historically thrived in certain tropical regions, only to be gradually replaced by a more aggressive and adaptable newcomer, allowing the latter to establish a foothold and potentially spread further.", "A species of tick that was once widely distributed in East Africa, but has been largely displaced by an invasive, Asian-origin tick species that has spread to tropical regions and is now a major vector of livestock diseases.", "A
