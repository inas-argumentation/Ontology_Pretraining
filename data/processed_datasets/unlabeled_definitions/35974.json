transfer of associated or disease-causing organisms.", "A period of controlled and isolated observation, preceding the introduction of a species or entity, in which all necessary measures are taken to identify, contain, and mitigate potential risks to the ecosystem, industry, or local populations, thereby preventing the unintended spread of non-native organisms or diseases.", "A period of isolation
