{"disappearing and novel climates": ["The changing environmental conditions that may render certain habitats inhospitable to existing species due to mismatches in temperature, humidity, or other factors, resulting in the loss of suitable climate for their survival and potentially leading to extinction or relocation.", "Areas where species habitats will no longer be suitable or viable due to climate change, causing species that are currently protected to lose their natural range or be pushed to the brink of extinction, while new areas that were previously unsuitable will become habitable, presenting both opportunities and challenges for conservation efforts.", "Areas where the natural environmental conditions that previously supported a specific ecosystem or species are no longer expected to occur due to shifts in climate, making it uncertain whether the species will find suitable habitats within a designated conservation zone.", "Environments that no longer provide suitable conditions for existing flora and fauna or introduce novel habitats that may not be currently conserved within protected areas, potentially compromising their ability to sustain biodiversity.", "Climates that were once compatible with the distribution of protected species will no longer be present in the same geographic region due to climate change, making them unfavorable for the long-term survival of these species, while other climates that were previously absent from protected areas may become suitable habitats, posing new conservation challenges."], "disappearing climates": ["The type of environmental condition that once existed in a protected area but is no longer feasible due to changes in climatic conditions, rendering the area unsuitable for species that were previously adapted to it, thereby threatening their very survival within those boundaries.", "A phenomenon where certain environmental conditions that are currently suitable for specific species within a protected area are expected to no longer exist within a 500 km radius of that location due to projected climate change, potentially rendering the area uninhabitable for those species in the future.", "A type of climatic shift where protected areas, which were previously suitable for extant species, are no longer expected to provide the necessary environmental conditions for their survival due to changing global temperatures, ultimately compromising the long-term conservation efficacy of these protected spaces.", "Areas within protected zones that are no longer capable of providing a suitable environment for extant species to thrive, due to changing climatic conditions, resulting in a loss of ecological integrity and potential extinction.", "A circumstance where areas previously suitable for certain species due to climatic conditions cease to provide adequate environmental circumstances, potentially threatening the long-term persistence of those species."], "transboundary range shifts": ["The movement of a species' population across international boundaries in response to changing environmental conditions, potentially encountering physical and non-physical barriers that hinder its adaptation and survival in new locations, thereby requiring coordinated conservation efforts across national jurisdictions.", "The movement of a species' ecological niche or habitat range across international borders, driven by climate change, and potentially hindered by physical or non-physical barriers, resulting in the need for coordinated conservation efforts to ensure the long-term protection of the species and its range.", "The phenomenon where a species' range expansion or contraction leads to its presence in a protected area in a different country than its original habitat, often due to climate change-induced movements that are hindered or facilitated by geographical and conservation policy boundaries.", "The phenomenon of species populations gradually moving across geopolitical boundaries, often prompted by changing environmental conditions, resulting in a reconfiguration of their distribution within protected areas and ecosystems, and potentially posing conservation challenges due to differences in country-specific conservation policies and management practices.", "The phenomenon where species, whose habitats are traditionally contained within a specific geographic boundary, begin to migrate or expand to other regions or countries, potentially driven by changes in climate or other environmental factors, and are hindered or facilitated by various physical and non-physical barriers."], "global protected area network": ["A system of designated sites around the world that are set aside to preserve and protect biodiversity, where varying environmental conditions serve as a safety net for plant and animal species, and efforts are made to maintain and adapt these conservation areas in response to changing climate patterns.", "A spatial network of designated sites, comprising a collective endeavor to safeguard a representative portion of the Earth's natural habitats, featuring varying levels of human-intervened management to preserve biodiversity, mitigate the impact of climate change, and promote ecological resilience across political boundaries.", "A network of designated conservation areas, dispersed across the globe, where ecological processes are protected and preserved to maintain biodiversity, amidst shifting climatic conditions, and despite geographic boundaries.", "A vast network of regions on Earth dedicated to preserving biodiversity by setting aside areas of ecological significance, where human activities are restricted to maintain the natural balance and provide a safeguard against the loss of species and ecosystems.", "A vast network of designated regions, covering a significant portion of the Earth's surface, that aim to safeguard and preserve biodiversity by restricting human activities and promoting ecological integrity, amidst a rapidly changing climate."], "climate analogs": ["A methodological framework that uses historical climate data to identify and match existing protected areas with analogous climates that have undergone similar temperature changes, allowing researchers to predict how species may respond to future climate shifts.", "A type of spatial and temporal framework that enables the identification of climate scenarios that share similarities with current climate conditions within a protected area network, allowing for the prediction of potential changes and their impacts on the distribution of species across borders.", "A tool used to evaluate and predict how environmental conditions within protected areas may change or shift in the future, allowing conservationists to anticipate and prepare for potential disruptions to the ecosystems and species they are intended to safeguard.", "Areas or locations on the planet with comparable environmental conditions, temperature ranges, and ecosystems that serve as reference points to predict and understand how changing climatic conditions will impact existing and future protected habitats.", "A method for comparing and contrasting geographical locations based on their climate characteristics, allowing for the identification of regions with similar environmental conditions and potential implications for species distribution and conservation under changing climate scenarios."]}
