further spread.", "A highly adaptable and potentially devastating aquatic invasive species capable of quickly expanding its range and outcompeting native fish populations.", "A small, invasive fish that has established itself in various European waterways, outcompeting native species and posing a threat to the ecological balance of its new habitats, often introduced unintentionally through human activities such as fish farming.", "A small, invasive fish that has been known to expand its range rapidly, threatening native aquatic species and ecosystems, often originating from accidental introductions through human activity."], "iberian peninsula": ["A region in southwestern Europe, characterized by a rich biodiversity and a growing concern for invasive species, with several major rivers serving as habitats for both native and non-native fish species, and frequently hosting local fish farms that can inadvertently introduce new species into the ecosystem.", "A region in southwestern Europe where the intersection of Mediterranean and Atlantic influences has given rise to a unique cultural and ecological heritage, with a rich history of agricultural and fish farming practices that has, on occasion, led to the introduction of non-native species into local waterways.", "The southwestern portion of the Eurasian continent, comprising the rugged terrain and meandering waterways of a landmass that has historically been isolated by the Pyrenees, but is now increasingly interconnected with other European regions through trade, human migration, and accidental species introductions.", "A region in southwestern Europe characterized by a rich aquatic biodiversity and a history of ecological disruptions, featuring a complex network of rivers and wetlands that have been affected by invasive species and human activity.", "A region in southwestern Europe, characterized by a shared geographical and ecological identity, where a diverse range of native fish species coexist, and where the presence of introduced species, such as Pseudorasbora parva, can have significant impacts on the region's aquatic ecosystems."], "fish introduction": ["The unintentional or intentional release of a non-native aquatic species into a new environment, which can have significant ecological and economic consequences, including the potential disruption of local food chains, competition for resources, and introduction of invasive species that can outcompete native species.", "The intentional or accidental release of a non-native aquatic species into a new environment, which can lead to a significant impact on the native ecosystem, potentially causing harm to the local biodiversity and threatening the ecological balance.", "The unintended or intentional transfer of a non-native aquatic organism into a new environment, often as a result of human activity, leading to potential disruptions to the ecological balance and native species populations.", "The unintended or intentional transfer of a non-native aquatic species from a controlled environment, such as a farm or hatchery, into the wild, resulting in the establishment of a new population that can potentially outcompete native species for resources and alter the ecosystem's balance.", "The deliberate or accidental transplantation of a non-native aquatic species into a new ecosystem, often with potential consequences for the indigenous flora and fauna, as exemplified by the unwitting release of a fish from a local farm into a new river basin."], "exotic fish": ["A species of fish that is not native to a particular region or waterway, often introduced unintentionally or intentionally, which can potentially harm the native ecosystem and alter the balance of the local aquatic community.", "A fish species that is not native to a region, often introduced unintentionally or intentionally through human activity, and has the potential to significantly alter the local ecosystem and outcompete indigenous species.", "Fish species introduced from outside their natural geographic range, either intentionally or accidentally, and which can potentially disrupt the ecological balance of the receiving environment.", "Non-native fish species introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, potentially posing a threat to the native biodiversity and ecological balance, as illustrated by
