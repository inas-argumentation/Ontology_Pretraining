the distribution of species and the formation of ecosystems.", "The recent geological period characterized by repeated oscillations between glacial and interglacial phases, which have had a profound impact on the evolution and distribution of life on Earth, shaping the complex biogeographic patterns observed in ancient and modern species."], "diversification rates": ["The rate at which distinct ecological niches and lineages emerge and thrive in a given region, often resulting in a rapid expansion of species diversity.", "The speed at which closely related species in a given geographic area give rise to new, distinct species over time, often reflecting local evolutionary pressures and environmental changes.", "The rate at which distinct lineages within a biological group evolve and multiply, often driven by spatial patterns of co-occurrence, geographic isolation, and environmental factors, which can lead to a increase in species richness and taxonomic diversity.", "The measure of how quickly and extensively a group of organisms occupies new geographic areas and adapts to different environmental conditions, resulting in the formation of new species over time.", "The speed and extent to which related species spread out and evolve distinct characteristics in different geographic areas, often reflecting a balance between competition and adaptation to their environment."], "rodents": ["Small, versatile mammals that have conquered a wide range of ecological niches in the Neotropics, often achieving high species richness and rapid diversification in specific regions,

exhibiting varied rates of speciation and geographic distribution, with some populations showing a strong correlation between genetic relatedness and rapid evolution.", "Small, primarily herbivorous or omnivorous mammals that have undergone a rapid evolutionary radiation in the Neotropics, characterized by a diverse range of species that have adapted to various ecological niches.", "A group of small, often rapid-reproducing mammals that have inhabited various regions of the Neotropics for millions of years, displaying remarkable adaptability and speciation in response to changing environmental conditions and geological events, resulting in a stunning diversity of species.", "A diverse group of small to medium-sized, furry, and often nimble creatures that have successfully invaded and adapted to various regions of the South American continent, displaying unique patterns of co-occurrence and diversification driven by geographic and climatic factors."], "neotropics": ["A region characterized by a unique mix of ancient and recent evolutionary history, where species diversity is shaped by the complex interplay of geological, climatic, and ecological factors, resulting in distinct patterns of species distribution, adaptation, and diversification across a sprawling territory.", "A vast and biodiverse region characterized by a unique combination of geological history, ecological connectivity, and climatic variation, which has given rise to a rich array of endemic species that have evolved in relative isolation over millions of years, resulting in a complex pattern of species distribution, co-occurrence, and diversification.", "The region of the Americas where a complex interplay of geological, climatic, and ecological factors has given rise to a diverse array of endemic species that have undergone rapid radiation and speciation, characterized by a distinctive biogeographic pattern of closely related species exhibiting high diversification rates in certain subregions.", "A vast and biodiverse region where the intersection of ancient landmasses and shifting climatic conditions has given rise to a spectacular array of rodent diversity, with species of varying evolutionary ages and ecological adaptations, and where the subtle interplay of geographic barriers and historical connections has shaped the complex patterns of species distribution and diversification observed today.", "The warm, humid region of the Americas where the meeting of ancient and modern geological processes has given rise to an extraordinary explosion of plant and animal diversity, with particular emphasis on the mammalian radiation of small, adaptable rodents that thrive in a tapestry of forests, grasslands, and mountains."], "amazonia": ["A vast, humid region of immense ecological significance, characterized by an intricate network of ancient landscapes and biomes, where an extraordinary array of flora and fauna have evolved and diversified over millions of years, with a profound impact on the global species tree.", "The vast, lush region of South America that has played a crucial role in the evolutionary history of rodents, serving as a corridor for colonization and diversification, and characterized by its high species richness and complex geological history.", "The sprawling, lush expanse of tropical lowlands where ancient ecological pathways have fostered the evolution of novel species assemblages, and where the intersection of tectonic upheaval and climatic fluctuations has sculpted the very fabric of biodiversity.", "A vast, lush region
