thrive and spread in a new environment.", "A characteristic that categorizes plant species based on their primary growth habit, such as their tendency to spread via underground stolons, rise to a certain height, or form dense mats, which can influence their ability to adapt to new environments and outcompete native species.", "A fundamental ecological classification based on a plant's growth habits, encompassing its adaptations for survival, reproduction, and spread in various environments, often influencing its ability to establish and thrive in new regions.", "The fundamental characteristics that define an organism's structure, habit, and behavior, influencing its ability to survive and thrive in its natural environment, and which can also be a factor in determining its potential to establish and spread in a new location.", "A characteristic that describes a plant's fundamental way of growing, adapting, and interacting with its environment, which can influence its ability to survive and thrive in a new location."], "introduced plants": ["Plants that are intentionally or unintentionally brought into a new geographic area, often through human activity, where they may not have previously existed or may not have been native to the region.", "The intentional or unintentional transportation and establishment of non-native organisms in a region, often facilitated by human activity, which can lead to the potential invasion and disruption of local ecosystems.", "A type of plant species that has been transported to a new environment, either intentionally for cultivation or unintentionally through human activity or natural dispersal, and may potentially alter the native ecosystem by outcompeting native species for resources.", "Plants that are deliberately or unintentionally relocated from their native environments to a new location, often through human activity, where they may establish self-sustaining populations and potentially outcompete native species for resources.", "Species intentionally or unintentionally transported to a new geographic location, where they may establish themselves and potentially outcompete native flora, often through their ability to adapt to a broad range of environmental conditions."], "geographic range": ["The breadth and extent of a species' ability to thrive in various regions, reflecting its capacity to adapt to diverse environmental conditions and successfully spread to new areas.", "The extent of a species' presence across different regions, typically influenced by the adaptability and ecological tolerance of the species, which can subsequently impact its potential to spread and thrive in new environments.", "The territory over which a species' natural dispersal or human-assisted movement has occurred, indicating its capacity to thrive in various ecological niches.", "The extent of a species' historical and current occupancy within a defined area, encompassing its ability to thrive in a variety of environments, which can often be an indicator of its likelihood to successfully colonize and become established in new locations.", "The distance over which a species' ecological flexibility allows it to disperse and establish populations, often indicating its propensity to spread beyond its native boundaries."], "canada": ["A vast and temperate landmass where the boundaries between nature and human influence are blurred, and the importation of biological materials carries with it the potential for unintended consequences.", "A vast, expansive territory known for its northern landscapes and environmental diversity, where the boundaries between horticulture and ecology are blurred, and the natural world is often vulnerable to the influences of intentional and accidental introductions from afar.", "A vast and geographically diverse landmass, where intentional and accidental introductions of plant species can have profound effects on its ecosystems, with its history of botanical exploration and distribution patterns playing a crucial role in shaping its ecological dynamics.", "A vast and dynamic region characterized by a complex tapestry of flora and fauna, where the subtle interplay between native and introduced plant species has revealed the profound importance of geographical distribution in determining invasive potential.", "A vast and fertile territory where the delicate balance between native and non-native flora is constantly threatened by the unforeseen consequences of human activity."], "logistic regression": ["A statistical method used to identify patterns and relationships between biological characteristics and environmental factors, allowing researchers to predict the likelihood of a plant species becoming invasive in a new

and a set of characteristics, in this case, biological attributes, to predict the likelihood of a plant species successfully establishing itself in a new environment.", "A statistical method used to identify the most influential factors in predicting a specific outcome, such as the potential to thrive in a new environment, by analyzing the relationship between various characteristics, like plant traits and geographic distribution, and the likelihood of a particular result.", "A statistical approach that examines the relationship between a set of measurable characteristics and the likelihood of a species succeeding in a new environment, allowing researchers to identify which factors are most influential in determining a plant's potential to thrive and potentially become invasive.", "A statistical technique used to examine the relationship between a categorical outcome variable and one or more predictor variables, aiming to identify the likelihood of a specific event or classification occurring based on measurable characteristics.
