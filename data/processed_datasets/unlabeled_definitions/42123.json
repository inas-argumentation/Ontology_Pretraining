species and potentially altered habitat structure, potentially influencing the behavior and activity patterns of small mammals, which in turn affect the survival and growth of sensitive vegetation species such as certain grasses.", "A transition zone where a region of open, herbaceous vegetation borders a region of woody vegetation, creating a complex interface where the composition and

struggle to establish itself in areas where shrubs have invaded, potentially due to increased herbivory pressure from small mammals.", "A type of drought-tolerant perennial grass that is native to arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its ability to thrive in fragile ecological balances and be vulnerable to disturbances caused by shifts in vegetation composition.", "A type of drought-resistant, perennial grass that thrives in arid regions, its seeds frequently falling prey to small mammalian herbivores in ecotones where grasslands and shrublands converge."], "shrubland": ["Areas where grasses and wildflowers are partially shaded and overlapped by a dense understory of woody, shrub-like vegetation, which can inhibit the growth and establishment of native grasses and

and more densely vegetated areas, where small mammals and other herbivores may play a crucial role in shaping the balance of species populations.", "An area where grasslands and desert habitats blend together, characterized by a mix of low-growing woody plants and a diversity of herbaceous vegetation, where the vegetation composition is influenced by the interactions between native small mammals
