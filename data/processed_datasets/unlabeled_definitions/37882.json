{"earthworm invasion": ["The introduction of a previously non-abundant or non-native organism into a soil ecosystem, which can alter the composition and structure of the soil community through modifications to soil texture, predation of seeds and seedlings, and consumption of organic matter, leading to changes in the diversity, abundance, and dominance of plant species and potentially altering the overall trajectory of ecosystem development.", "The introduction of a non-native species that modifies soil structure, consumes organic matter, and selectively depredates seeds and seedlings, leading to a reshaping of the early stages of ecosystem development and community composition.", "The unforeseen and pervasive presence of certain burrowing invertebrates in an ecosystem, characterized by their manipulation of soil structure, consumption of plant life stages, and disproportionate impact on specific plant species with varying morphological traits, leading to altered community composition and altered ecosystem function over time.", "The phenomenon of non-native invertebrate burrowers establishing populations in a new habitat, altering ecosystem processes and potentially reshaping the composition of plant communities by selectively influencing seedling survival, growth, and diversity.", "The sudden introduction of a burrowing invertebrate to a previously unaffected ecosystem, leading to significant changes in soil structure, seedling survival, and community assembly, with effects that are particularly pronounced in areas with altered plant morphology traits."]}
