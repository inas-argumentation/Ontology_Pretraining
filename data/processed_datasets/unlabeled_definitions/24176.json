interconnected pathways and zones that shape the distribution, movement, and interaction of organisms across a given area, influenced by both the physical structure and the ecological dynamics within it.", "The complex interplay of natural and human-induced factors that shape the distribution and movement of species across varied environments, ultimately influencing the presence and spread of certain organisms.", "The spatial complex of interconnected natural and human-modified habitats that shape the dispersal and distribution of species, featuring channels of facilitation and barriers to migration.", "A geographic expanse characterized by a network of pathways, boundaries, and natural features that intersect and shape the movement and distribution of organisms, including invasive
