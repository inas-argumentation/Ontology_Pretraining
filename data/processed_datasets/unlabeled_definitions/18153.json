{"darwin's naturalization": ["The process by which a non-native species becomes established in a new environment due to a lack of preadaptation barriers, allowing it to outcompete native species and expand its range, often facilitated by ecological and evolutionary factors.", "The tendency of non-native plant species that are evolutionarily distant from native species to thrive and spread in a new environment, potentially due to a lack of effective resistance or competition from native species.", "The phenomenon where the degree of relatedness between non-native and native species in a community is a significant predictor of their coexistence and persistence, suggesting that species with less similar evolutionary histories may have an advantage in establishing and thriving in a new environment.", "The process by which non-native plant species become established and thrive in an ecosystem through a unique combination of evolutionary, ecological, and environmental factors, which ultimately leads to their integration into the native community.", "The process by which non-native species establish themselves in an ecosystem through a tendency to be more evolutionarily distant from native species, potentially due to factors such as adaptability, reproductive capacity, or ability to exploit environmental niches."], "robben island": ["A remote, densely vegetated island with a limited native species pool, prone to invasion by distant, unrelated plant species that can significantly alter its ecological balance and diversity.", "A remote terrestrial ecosystem off the coast of Africa where the isolation of a once-disturbed flora has led to a unique interplay between native and non-native plant species, resulting in a complex dynamic of ecological interactions and invasion dynamics.", "A remote offshore location in South Africa where the delicate balance of native flora is threatened by the invasion of non-indigenous plant species, highlighting the importance of understanding the complex interplay between species traits and environmental factors in the context of ecological restoration.", "A remote, ecologically fragile island in the Southern Hemisphere where the delicate balance of its flora is threatened by invasive plant species, requiring a deep understanding of the phylogenetic relationships between native and introduced species to develop effective conservation strategies.", "A remote island ecosystem with a unique and vulnerable plant community, susceptible to invasive species that can alter its natural balance and composition, making it a critical site for scientists to study and manage plant invasions."], "naturalization hypothesis": ["The idea that the likelihood of a non-native species thriving in a new environment is influenced by its evolutionary relationship with the native species in that environment, suggesting that more closely related species are more likely to coexist peacefully.", "The idea that the likelihood of a non-native species establishing and thriving in a new environment is influenced by its degree of evolutionary similarity to native species.", "The tendency of alien plant species to thrive in an ecosystem due to their genetic distance from native species, potentially resulting in reduced competition and resource competition, allowing them to adapt and dominate their new environment.", "The notion that the likelihood of a non-native species establishing itself in a new environment is influenced by its evolutionary relationship with the native species that already inhabit the area, suggesting that similar or closely-related species may have a higher chance of successfully invading and coexisting with native species.", "The tendency for non-native species to successfully integrate into a new ecosystem, often due to their ability to adapt to novel environments and outcompete native species, which can be influenced by their phylogenetic relationships and intrinsic characteristics."], "phylogenetic signal": ["The pattern of evolutionary relationships revealed in the analysis of DNA sequences, which can be used to identify the degree to which a species' invasive nature is influenced by its ancestral connection to native species, and thus inform strategies for managing and conserving biodiversity.", "The distinct pattern of evolutionary relationships between species that can be detected in the analysis of DNA sequences or other characteristics, which can provide clues about the potential success or failure of a non-native species to thrive in a new environment.", "The pattern of evolutionary relatedness among organisms that underlies the distribution and abundance of species in a community, revealing the legacy of their shared and distinct

influence their present-day characteristics and potential to thrive in new environments.", "The presence of inherent relationships between the characteristics of organisms and their evolutionary
