expansion, such as the gradual adaptation of an invasive ant to novel environments.", "A systematic collection of observations, recorded over a specific period, revealing a sequence of events or conditions that describe the development, progression, or expansion of a phenomenon, often facilitating an understanding of its dynamics and trajectory.", "A sequential arrangement of data that documents the evolution of ecological systems over time, providing insights into the dynamics of population spread, environmental adaptation, and predictive modeling of invasive species.", "A sequence of recorded events or occurrences, often used to monitor and understand the changing dynamics of a particular system, such as the progression of a biological invasion, where each entry represents a snapshot of the environment and the species at a specific point in time.", "A sequential collection of observations or measurements taken at regular intervals, used to track changes or trends in a phenomenon, such as the expansion of a species into new habitats over time."], "species range": ["The collective sum of all locations where a given organism is capable of persisting, reproducing, and potentially expanding its population over time, taking into account the nuances of environmental conditions and the evolutionary processes that have shaped its dispersal and colonization patterns.",

pressures that have shaped its distribution and adaptation over time, influencing its potential for expansion, contraction, or persistence.", "The territorial extent within which a biological entity habitually resides, characterized by the dynamic interaction between its ecological adaptations and the environmental conditions that support or hinder its survival.", "The spatial extent within which a population of organisms has consistently co-occurred with specific environmental conditions and ecological processes, thereby influencing the likelihood of its successful establishment and
