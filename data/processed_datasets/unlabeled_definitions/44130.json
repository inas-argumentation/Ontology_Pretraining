{"dominance effects": ["The extent to which a dominant species exercises its environmental and competitive influences, allowing it to significantly affect the ecosystem's productivity, nutrient cycling, and energy flow, often at the expense of native species' coexistence.", "The phenomenon where the presence of a particular species or entity within a community leads to an increase in the overall functionality or productivity of that community, often at the expense of other coexisting species, due to its ability to occupy a dominant position in the ecological niche or exert a strong influence over the environment.", "The phenomenon whereby a non-native species, through its overwhelming abundance and altered ecological dynamics, supersedes the influence of native species on ecosystem functioning, resulting in a shift towards increased resource acquisition and processing, while simultaneously diminishing biodiversity and altering trophic interactions.", "The extent to which a single, pervasive species in an ecosystem exercises a strong influence on resource capture and utilization, often resulting in the suppression of other species and altering the overall functioning of the ecosystem, while also potentially benefiting from its own abundance.", "The phenomenon where a single species or individual with distinct characteristics dominates the ecosystem by altering the availability of resources, leading to changes in the composition and structure of the community, and ultimately shaping the trajectory of ecosystem processes and interactions."], "biodiversity and ecosystem functioning": ["The complex interplay between the variety of life forms and the ecological processes they drive, which together determine the overall health, resilience, and productivity of an ecosystem, influencing the balance of nutrients, energy flows, and interactions between species across different trophic levels.", "The complex and dynamic interplay between the variety and abundance of plant and animal species, and the intricate networks of relationships between them, which ultimately determines the capacity of ecosystems to provide essential services and support for life, including the efficient circulation of nutrients and energy, the stability of ecological processes, and the delivery of benefits to higher trophic levels.", "The complex interplay between the variety of organisms in an ecosystem, their characteristics, and their interactions, which collectively influence the flow of energy, nutrient cycling, and the delivery of essential ecosystem services.", "The intricate relationship between the complex arrangement of species within an ecosystem, and the various processes and functions that arise from their interactions, leading to a dynamic balance that supports the flow of energy and nutrients, as well as the diversity of life at all levels of the food chain.", "The complex interplay between the variety of species and their functional roles in an ecological system, which ultimately influences the provision of essential services, such as nutrient cycling, energy transfer, and habitat creation, and is shaped by the interactions between dominant species, native diversity, and environmental conditions."], "trait-based ecology": ["The study of the ways in which the characteristics of individual organisms, when considered collectively, shape the structure and functioning of ecosystems through their interactions with other species and the environment.", "The study of how the unique characteristics and combinations of species within an ecosystem influence their interactions, ecological roles, and impacts on the functioning of that ecosystem, revealing complex patterns and relationships that shape the dynamics of diversity, productivity, and stability.", "The scientific approach of examining and understanding the ecological roles and interactions of individual organisms within a community by focusing on the specific characteristics that determine their functional contributions, allowing for the identification of patterns and relationships between these characteristics and ecosystem processes.", "The study of how the characteristics of individual organisms shape their roles and interactions within ecosystems, ultimately influencing the structure and functioning of these systems.", "The study of how the unique characteristics and adaptations of individual species influence their interactions and ecological roles within a community, with a focus on how these interactions shape the structure and functioning of ecosystems."], "niche complementarity": ["The phenomenon where the unique ecological roles and abilities of remaining species in a community, freed from the dominant influence of an invasive species, lead to a harmonious and beneficial interaction with the environment, allowing for increased ecosystem function and support for higher trophic levels.", "The harmonious coexistence of resident species, which thrive and interact with their environment in a mutually beneficial manner, ultimately contributing to the enhanced functioning and resilience of the ecosystem.", "When the coexistence of different species within an ecosystem yields complementary contributions to ecosystem functioning, such that the presence of one species allows for the exploitation of a resource or niche that would otherwise be inaccessible or underutilized by another species, leading to a more resilient and diverse community.", "The phenomenon where the presence of diverse species in a community allows for more efficient utilization of resources, leading to increased overall ecosystem productivity and resilience, as each species exploits a unique aspect of its environment to thrive.", "The harmonious coexistence and mutually beneficial interactions between species that occupy distinct ecological roles, allowing them to thrive together and contribute to the overall resilience and functionality of an ecosystem."], "biodiversity-ecosystem function": ["The complex interplay between the variety of species and their unique roles within an ecosystem, influencing the rates and processes that govern the exchange of energy and nutrients, as well as the interactions between different trophic levels, ultimately shaping the overall health and resilience of the ecosystem.", "The reciprocal relationship between the complexity of interactions among organisms within an ecosystem and the ecosystem's ability to provide essential services, such as nutrient cycling, energy flow, and support for higher trophic levels, which in turn influence the dynamics of species coexistence and the maintenance of ecological integrity.", "The harmonious interaction between the variety of organisms in an ecosystem and the complex processes they participate in, which ultimately determines the balance of vital resources and services provided by the ecosystem.", "The intricate interplay between the variety of living organisms and the vital processes that govern the workings of a self-sustaining environment, with changes in the abundance and
