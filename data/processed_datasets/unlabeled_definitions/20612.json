species increases its presence and spreads its range in a specific area, often in response to environmental changes, habitat alterations, or human activities, resulting in an expansion of its population and potentially leading to displacement of native species.", "The process by which a non-indigenous species, often more adaptable to changing environmental conditions, becomes established
