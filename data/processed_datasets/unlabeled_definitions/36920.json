an influx of migratory birds, during which a species may exhibit a concentrated occurrence in a particular region or habitat.", "The three-month period of cold temperatures and reduced daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere, characterized by a distinct peak in the observation of a certain migratory bird species.", "A period characterized by a significant increase in recorded observations of a specific non-native bird species, typically coinciding with the cold months of the year, during which the species' movement patterns become more concentrated and predictable."], "mandarin duck": ["A species of waterfowl, characterized by its seasonal fluctuations in population, with a propensity to congregate in specific regions during the winter months, often featuring a disproportionate representation of males amidst its overall count.", "A migratory bird species, native to East Asia, that has established a non-native population in the Czech Republic, characterized by its seasonal fluctuations in occurrence, with a higher concentration in the winter months and a significant presence in certain regions, such as the Central Bohemian Region and the South Moravian Region, where it has even formed a stable breeding population.", "A vibrant and adaptable bird species, commonly found in wintering grounds, exhibiting a strong preference for certain regions and displaying a noticeable gender divide, with males outnumbering females.", "A waterfowl species native to East Asia, known for its striking plumage and migratory patterns, which occasionally ventures to Western Europe, often settling in specific regions during the winter months, where it can be observed in significant numbers, with a noticeable gender imbalance, and occasionally establishes breeding populations.", "A highly migratory, partially arboreal waterbird native to East Asia, whose winter populations in certain regions have shown significant changes in recent years, with a notable concentration shift from a particular area to another, likely driven by breeding habits and environmental factors."], "central europe": ["The continental zone where a diverse array of bird species exhibits seasonal fluctuations in population, with a notable concentration of certain non-native species in specific regions during the winter months, marked by the presence of a majestic waterfowl species and its gradual shift in breeding habits over the years.", "A geographic region characterized by a temperate climate, with a high concentration of waterways and rivers, and a complex history of breeding and migrating bird populations, which has been influenced by human activities and natural habitats over centuries, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium of species occurrence and distribution.", "A region characterized by a unique confluence of geographical and climatic conditions, where a diverse array of native and non-native bird species coexist and exhibit dynamic seasonal
