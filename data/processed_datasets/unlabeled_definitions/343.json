from certain native ant species.", "A highly successful, invasive ant species that has globally displaced native ant populations, except in certain areas where it encounters a determined and chemically-armed native competitor.", "A type of invasive ant species known for its widespread global distribution and propensity to displace native ant populations, which often results in the decline

means, spreads to new areas and dominates native populations, displacing them from their ecological niches, often with significant impacts on the invaded ecosystem and native biodiversity.", "A non-native organism that, when introduced to a new environment, can outcompete and displace native species for resources, often establishing large populations that can disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem.", "A species that, when introduced to an area where it is not native, rapidly expands its geographic range and dominates local ecosystems, often outcompeting and displacing native species, as witnessed in the encroachment of certain ants on the winter habitats of native species."], "prenolepis imaris": ["A species of ant known for its tenacity and chemical prowess, capable of

to effectively counter the invasive pressure of another species by employing a potent defense mechanism, allowing it to thrive in areas where it would otherwise be displaced.", "A small, resilient ant species known for its effective defense strategies against invasive competitors, particularly those that thrive in disrupted ecological environments.", "A species of ant characterized by its ability to adaptively defend its territory against invasive competitors, employing a potent chemical secretion that is lethal to the invaders, thereby maintaining its presence in areas where native ants are often displaced."], "invasive ant species": ["A species that spreads rapidly across new habitats, often outcompeting and replacing native inhabitants, typically displaying remarkable adaptability and resilience, and frequently exhibiting formidable colonization strategies that enable them to thrive in diverse environmental conditions.", "A species that, when introduced to a new geographic area, spreads rapidly and competes with native species for resources, often leading to the displacement or suppression of native populations, and poses a significant threat to local ecosystems.", "A species of ant that, through its widespread establishment and displacement of native ant species, illustrates the profound impact of ecological invasiveness, where its mere presence threatens the coexistence of other species in its occupied territories.", "A type of non-native ant that aggressively outcompetes and replaces native ant species in their habitat, often thriving in disturbed or altered ecosystems and causing significant ecological impacts.", "A species of ant that, having established itself in a new region through human activity or natural dispersal, begins to overwhelm native ant
