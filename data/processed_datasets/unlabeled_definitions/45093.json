{"integro-difference equations. 1 introduction invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity and economy [1": ["A mathematical tool used to simulate the growth and spread of populations in complex systems, particularly those influenced by spatial structures or barriers, allowing researchers to analyze the interplay between environmental factors and population dynamics.", "A mathematical construct that enables researchers to model the complex interactions between variables, particularly in the context of population dynamics, by analyzing the cumulative effects of changes over time and space, ultimately providing valuable insights into the spread and containment of unwanted phenomena.", "A mathematical framework that simulates the complex dynamics of a population's spread, taking into account factors such as growth rates, environmental conditions, and geographical boundaries, ultimately enabling the prediction of how an unwanted biological entity can either be halted, consolidated, or accelerated across a territory.", "Mathematical models that describe the growth and spread of complex systems by tracking the differences between sequential stages, allowing for the examination of how environmental and ecological factors influence the trajectory of population growth and movement.", "A system of mathematical equations that describe the dynamics of a population's growth and dispersal over time and space, often used to model the spread of non-native organisms in a heterogeneous environment."], "stage-structured populations": ["A type of population that progresses through distinct life stages, where the growth and spread of individuals are influenced by specific environmental and ecological factors, and can be thought of as a series of consecutive \"arrival stations\" on a route of invasion.", "A population of organisms that undergoes distinct developmental or life cycle stages, which can be described and modeled in a mathematical framework that accounts for their sequential progression and potential interactions with the environment and other species.", "A population that exhibits variation in its life cycle phases, where each phase is characterized by distinct biological and ecological properties, and the transition between phases is influenced by environmental and demographic factors, which can be spatially and temporally heterogeneous.", "A population comprising distinct groups, each with a unique characteristic or stage, such as age, size, or development, that can influence their interactions with the environment and other individuals, thereby shaping their distribution and spread in response to factors like infrastructure, such as roads.", "Populations composed of distinct demographic cohorts that progress through specific life stages, influencing the spread and growth of the population as a whole, can be characterized by a dynamic interplay between these cohorts and their respective environmental contexts."], "beachheads": ["A threshold area of initial infestation, formed by a limited and isolated foothold of an invasive species, which serves as a foundation for subsequent expansion into unoccupied or previously inaccessible regions.", "A focal point of establishment for an invasive species, where a small, initially insignificant presence gains a foothold and subsequently expands its range, potentially transforming the affected ecosystem.", "A point of entry or initial foothold of a spreading entity, such as a species, into a previously uninvaded or resistant area, characterized by a delicate balance of environmental conditions and ecological factors that can be susceptible to sudden shifts or tipping points, potentially leading to rapid expansion or stagnation.", "A focal point of initial establishment and expansion, where the boundaries between a dominant ecosystem and an invasive species are negotiated, potentially leading to a gradual transition of territory.", "A phenomenon where a pioneering population of an invasive species, despite being confronted with a physical obstacle, manages to establish a foothold in a new area by exploiting specific environmental conditions, thereby facilitating the subsequent expansion of the invasive species beyond the initial barrier."], "barriers": ["A structure or feature that prevents the expansion of an invasive species by disrupting its natural dispersal patterns and restricting its access to new habitats.", "A phenomenon where the presence of a physical structure in an environment can limit the expansion or spread of a non-native species by creating a barrier to its movement or dispersal, thereby hindering its ability to colonize or dominate a particular area.", "A structure or feature that impedes the advance of a foreign entity by obstructing its movement or expansion into a particular region, thereby arresting its progression and limiting its potential for growth or spread.", "A dividing element or interface that, under certain conditions, restricts the proliferation of a dominant and often unwelcome presence, hindering its expansion into adjacent territories.", "A geographical feature or boundary that, in a given ecological context, limits the advancement or spread of an invasive species by disrupting or impeding its population dynamics, often by altering the distribution of resources, habitat, or dispersal pathways."]}
