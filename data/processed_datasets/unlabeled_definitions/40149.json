of others in their ecological community.", "The phenomenon where individual organisms of the same species, such as plants, struggle for limited resources like light, water, or nutrients, resulting in a decrease in growth or survival rates, whereas interactions between different species can lead to a similar outcome, with the dominant species gaining an advantage over the subordinate one,
