life forms that thrive in complex relationships with soil and plant communities, encompassing the variety of species, interactions, and ecological processes that underpin the health and resilience of ecosystems.", "The variability and richness of fungal species and their roles in decomposing organic matter and facilitating nutrient cycling, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and functioning of ecosystems.", "The variety and complexity of symbiotic relationships between microorganisms in the soil, manifesting as a spectrum of functional traits and ecological roles that influence nutrient cycling, decomposition, and overall ecosystem structure."], "homogenisation": ["The process of creating a uniform ecosystem profile through the replacement of unique community structures with dominant and widespread species, ultimately resulting in a loss of local distinctiveness and biodiversity.", "The process by which the unique characteristics of distinct ecosystems, once a result of specific ecological relationships and histories, are gradually erased through the influx of non-native organisms, leading to a loss of diversity and a decrease in the overall complexity and resilience of the ecosystem.", "The tendency for diverse ecosystem components to merge and converge into a uniform structure, resulting in a loss of unique characteristics and features at different scales, ultimately leading to a diminished ecological complexity.", "The phenomenon by which the distinctive characteristics and compositions of ecosystem components, such as plant and fungal communities, become increasingly uniform and less varied as a result of the establishment of a dominant or invasive species, ultimately leading to a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem complexity.", "The process by which the unique character of an ecosystem is gradually erased, as a result of the replacement of its native components by non-native ones, leading to a loss of variation and distinctiveness in its ecological features."], "pinus nigra": ["A widespread and invasive coniferous tree species, often characterized by its significant impact on belowground ecosystems, leading to a decline in fungal diversity and a shift towards a dominant ectomycorrhizal community.", "A certain species of non-native evergreen conifer, notorious for its propensity to drive loss of soil fungal diversity, leading to a homogenization of belowground ecosystems, ultimately resulting in a dramatic decline in fungal diversity across various scales.", "A type of coniferous tree that, when introduced to new environments, can have a profound impact on the soil's fungal community, leading to a loss of diversity and a shift in community structure, ultimately affecting the ecosystem's resilience and potential for recovery.", "A dark-leaved, non-native coniferous tree species native to the Mediterranean region, whose widespread invasion can have a profound impact on the composition and diversity of soil fungal communities, leading to a loss of ecosystem heterogeneity and biodiversity.", "A non-native, coniferous tree species, commonly known for its capacity to homogenize plant communities and suppress fungal diversity in invaded ecosystems, leading to a cascade of effects on ecosystem heterogeneity."], "gamma-diversity": ["The extent to which a community or ecosystem is comprised of diverse and varied sub-communities, each with its own unique characteristics, such that the overall system benefits from the presence of multiple functional groups, exemplified by the contrast between a forest understory teeming with saprotrophic fungi and a densely populated pine stand dominated by ectomycorrhizal fungi.", "The collective uniqueness and distinctiveness of a community's belowground composition, encompassing the varied interactions and relationships between different plant and fungal species, which can be influenced by the presence of non-native species
