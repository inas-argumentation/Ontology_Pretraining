species that is on the brink of extinction due to a decline in its population, habitat destruction, or human activities that threaten its survival, such as the introduction of non-native species, competition with indigenous populations, and the loss of genetic diversity, making it vulnerable to the point where conservation efforts are necessary to prevent its extinction.", "A type of fish that is considered to be of high conservation concern due to its limited geographical distribution, reduced population size, and vulnerability to extinction, often resulting from human activities such as habitat disruption, hybridization with non-native species, and competition for resources with other aquatic organisms.", "A species of fish that is characterized by a critical decline in its original population, rendering it susceptible to local extirpation, yet its introduction to new habitats has led to the replacement or hybridization of indigenous populations, highlighting the complex balance
