{"avian fauna": ["A collective ensemble of birds inhabiting a particular geographic region, encompassing both native and non-native species that occupy a range of ecological niches.", "The collective group of bird species that inhabit a specific region or ecosystem, encompassing a diverse range of characteristics and behaviors, but often threatened by the introduction of non-native species that can alter their ecological balance and population dynamics.", "The collective assembly of bird species that inhabit a particular geographic area, consisting of both native and non-native populations, with a focus on those that have the potential to significantly alter the ecological balance and human-environment interactions within that area.", "The collective group of bird species inhabiting a region, encompassing both native and introduced populations that coexist and interact with one another in a delicate ecological balance, often with a focus on species that have crossed geographic boundaries and become established in new environments.", "The collective term referring to a group of wild birds inhabiting a specific region, often featuring a unique assortment of species that are native, migratory, or introduced, and whose populations can significantly impact local ecosystems."], "alien birds": ["Birds that are foreign to the native ecosystem, having entered an environment through human activities or natural migration, and often cause ecological disruption due to their lack of natural predators and competition for resources.", "Birds that have entered a region from another continent or region and have adapted to thrive in their new environment, often with significant impacts on the native ecosystem.", "Birds that have entered and established populations in an ecosystem through human intervention, often with unintended consequences, and can outcompete native species for resources and habitat.", "Species of birds that have been introduced to a foreign land through human activity and now thrive or spread in areas where they are not native, potentially disrupting the local ecosystem.", "Species of birds that, originating from a foreign avifauna, have established self-sustaining populations in a new geographic region, often leading to disruptions in the native ecosystem and biodiversity."]}
