activities, and can have profound impacts on native ecosystems and species interactions at a macroscale.", "Plants that spread beyond their native range, potentially outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem dynamics, and whose populations often exhibit characteristics of rapid growth, adaptability, and ability to thrive in various environments.", "Species that, through natural or human-assisted means, have traversed geographical boundaries and expanded their range, often overwhelming native ecosystems and altering forest compositions, with potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity.", "Species of vegetation that, through human or natural means, migrate to new geographic areas and colonize native ecosystems, often altering the composition, structure, and function of those ecosystems, with significant ecological, economic, and social implications.", "Non-native plant species that establish self-sustaining populations in forest ecosystems, often altering ecosystem processes and affecting native plant species, as revealed through extensive monitoring and analysis of forest systems at regional and national scales, highlighting the complex interplay between environmental factors and human activities that shape these ecological changes."], "monitoring": ["The systematic and repeated observation or tracking of phenomena, such as biological invasions, at broad spatial scales, often using large datasets or long-term measurements, to identify patterns, processes, and trends that inform understanding and management of complex systems.", "The systematic and repeated observation of changes or patterns in a large-scale biological system, such as forests, over time, with the goal of gaining comprehensive insights into complex processes and identifying underlying drivers, trends, and dynamics.", "The systematic and repeated observation of phenomena, processes, or patterns at a broad scale, aimed at gaining comprehensive understanding and insight into complex biological systems or phenomena, often requiring large datasets and repeated measurements over time.", "The systematic and repeated observation or measurement of ecological systems, aimed at gaining comprehensive understanding of changes, patterns, and relationships at broad spatial and temporal scales.", "A systematic and repeated examination of natural phenomena to identify and track patterns and processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales, enabling a deeper understanding of the complexities and dynamics of ecological systems."], "land-use": ["The intentional or unintentional alteration of natural areas, driven by human activities, which has a profound impact on the ecological makeup and behavior of a region, often shaping the distribution and abundance of plant species, including invasive ones.", "Human manipulation of the environment, resulting in lasting changes to ecosystems, often driven by population growth, resource exploitation, and infrastructure development, which can have far-reaching consequences for native species and communities.", "The way in which people make use of the land to achieve their goals, often leaving lasting legacies that shape the environment and influence the interactions between living organisms, including the spread of invasive species.", "The arrangement and utilization of vast natural areas, influenced by human activities, that shape the character and condition of ecosystems over time, ultimately affecting the distribution and behavior of invasive species.", "The modification or exploitation of a region's natural environments by human activities, resulting in changes to ecological processes, species distributions, and landcover, which can have cascading effects on biological invasions and ecosystem health."], "biological invasions": ["The process by which non-native plant species spread across large areas, altering the ecological balance of forests and other natural systems, often driven by human activities and legacies, and requiring comprehensive monitoring and analysis at regional and continental scales to fully understand their impacts.", "The proliferation of non-native species in ecosystems, leading to changes in community composition and potentially impacting forest ecosystems at large scales, often driven by human activities and influenced by regional land-use legacies.", "The spread and establishment of non-native plant species in previously undisturbed or uninvaded forest ecosystems, leading to significant impacts on ecosystem processes and biodiversity, and often driven by human activities and environmental factors at various spatial and temporal scales.", "The phenomenon of non-native organisms, facilitated by human activities and environmental factors, spreading and displacing native species across vast geographic areas, resulting in widespread changes to ecosystems and forests.", "The process by which non-native species, often accelerated by human activities and environmental factors, colonize and establish large-scale populations in foreign ecosystems, resulting in profound impacts on the invaded
