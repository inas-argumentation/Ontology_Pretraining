{"biotic interactions": ["The complex web of influences that arises when an organism encounters other living beings in its environment, leading to a dynamic interplay of consumption, competition, and symbiosis that shapes the organism's ability to survive and thrive.", "The intricate relationships between invasive species and the complex web of predators, parasites, and diseases that naturally coexist with them, which can influence the trajectory of range expansion and colonization in a changing environment.", "The complex relationships that arise when an organism comes into contact with other living beings in its environment, influencing its growth, development, and ability to establish itself, often having a more pronounced impact when populations encounter new ecosystems or ranges.", "The complex and reciprocal relationships that occur between organisms, such as the exchange of energy and nutrients, predation, competition for resources, and symbiotic relationships, which can have significant effects on the dynamics of invasive species populations as they expand their geographic ranges in response to changing environmental conditions.", "The complex and dynamic relationships between organisms in an ecosystem, including the predator-prey relationships, competition for resources, and other influences that shape the behavior, population dynamics, and geographic distribution of species, particularly in situations where environmental changes, such as climate change, may alter the landscape and reorganize these relationships."], "range edge": ["The area where a species' geographical distribution is expected to expand in response to changing environmental conditions, marked by an encounter with unfamiliar biotic communities and a potential tipping point for population growth and establishment.", "The area where a species' territorial boundaries are anticipated to expand as a result of climatic shifts, yet its population remains relatively sparse and unestablished, posing a critical threshold for the species' growth, reproduction, and potentially its very survival.", "The zone of heightened ecological tension, where a species' presence is precarious and its expansion is constrained by the interactions with native biological entities, but has not yet reached the point of widespread establishment.", "The boundary of an organism's geographical distribution, where the species' spread is beginning to encroach on unfamiliar terrain, exposing it to altered environmental conditions and interactions with new biological communities.", "The area beyond which a species is expected to extend its influence due to environmental changes, characterized by novel interactions with local biota and an increased risk of encountering species that may impede its dispersal or establishment."]}
