non-native species into new ecosystems, potentially causing ecological harm.", "The unauthorized, often unregulated, exchange of certain animals across international borders, facilitated by a variety of channels, including informal markets, online platforms, and retail establishments, which has the potential to introduce invasive species into new ecosystems.", "The practice of acquiring and
