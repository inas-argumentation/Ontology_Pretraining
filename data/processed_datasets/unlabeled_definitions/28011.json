unintentionally carry and pass on a particular genetic makeup, ultimately shaping the local gene pool over time.", "The process by which a new population emerges from a small, genetically distinct group of individuals that colonize a new area, potentially leading to a non-random distribution of genetic variation within that population.", "A phenomenon in population genetics where the genetic makeup of a colony is influenced by the selective bottlenecks of a small founding group, resulting in non-random frequencies of specific traits or characteristics in subsequent generations, which can manifest in distinct spatial patterns across a species' range.", "A phenomenon where the establishment of a population from a small group of founding individuals results in a characteristic
