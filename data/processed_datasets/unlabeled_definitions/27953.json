{"species saturation": ["The condition in which a community's ecological structure reaches a state where the maximum possible richness of native species has been achieved, rendering it impervious to further additions of non-native species without compromising native species presence and ecological functions.", "The point at which the carrying capacity of an ecosystem is exceeded by the number of coexisting species, resulting in a stability that is maintained through the balance of ecological processes and interactions between inhabitants.", "The point at which a community's capacity to support diversity is reached, resulting in a diminished capacity for additional species to be added without being dominated or competitively excluded by existing inhabitants, leading to a stabilization of the community's composition.", "The state in which the natural ecological niches of a specific aquatic environment are maximized, resulting in a stable and diverse assemblage of fish species, where any further additions would no longer significantly alter the community structure, even in the face of environmental and habitat fluctuations.", "A state where the ecological capacity of an aquatic ecosystem to support a diverse assemblage of fish species is fully utilized, resulting in a predictable and stable community structure that is shaped by local environmental conditions and regional species pools, with additional species introductions no longer contributing to the community's dynamics."], "french reservoirs": ["Man-made water storage systems that serve as artificial habitats for fish populations, characterized by varied environmental conditions that influence the structure and composition of aquatic communities.", "Man-made bodies of water characterized by diverse aquatic ecosystems, often surrounded by varying landscape features and human-influenced habitats, where the fish communities are shaped by a complex interplay between native and non-native species.", "Permanent artificial water bodies that store and regulate water flows, created by damming rivers, and characterized by a unique and dynamic ecosystem, influenced by both local and regional factors that affect the presence and distribution of native and non-native fish species.", "Freshwater storage facilities located throughout a European country, characterized by heterogeneous fish populations influenced by a combination of site-specific environmental factors and deliberate or unintentional introductions of non-indigenous species.", "A type of freshwater ecosystem characterized by artificial bodies of water created for the purpose of water storage, where a significant proportion of the fish community is composed of introduced species that have adapted to the environment, with local native species richness often being influenced by regional native richness and environmental characteristics."], "native and non-native richness": ["The measure of the variety of aquatic species present in a given ecosystem, with a focus on the degree to which these species have evolved alongside the ecosystem's unique environmental characteristics, versus those that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced from elsewhere and may not have the same adaptability or ecological role.", "The diversity of species present in a specific ecosystem, influenced by a combination of ecological and anthropogenic factors, including natural habitat preferences, environmental adaptations, and intentional or unintentional human interventions, which can result in a varied range of native and non-native species compositions.", "The quantitative measure of the presence of specific species in a given ecosystem, encompassing both the abundance of well-established, long-term residents and the unexpected appearances of newcomers, potentially originating from other regions or habitats.", "The quantitative measure of species diversity that can be naturally expected in a given ecosystem, unaffected by deliberate or uncontrolled introductions, as opposed to the actual diversity observed, which may be altered by the presence of non-indigenous species.", "The count of distinct, endemic species present in a given ecosystem, representing the native genetic makeup, is inversely correlated with the abundance of alien species introduced through deliberate or unintentional means, and is influenced by environmental characteristics, such as surface area, depth, and catchment area."], "fish species richness": ["The numerical diversity of distinct fish populations inhabiting a specific aquatic ecosystem, influenced by factors such as native community structures, environmental characteristics, and unintentional or deliberate introductions of non-indigenous species.", "The total number of distinct types of fish that inhabit a specific water body, reflecting the diversity of fish populations within that ecosystem.", "The quantity of distinct fish populations coexisting within a specific aquatic ecosystem, reflecting the diversity of species adapted to that environment and their relative abundance.", "The number of distinct ecological niches or roles fulfilled by aquatic organisms in a specific water body, reflecting the range of functional and taxonomic diversity within that community.", "The number of distinct types of fish that inhabit a specific body of water, encompassing both native and introduced populations, and representing the diversity of fish communities in that ecosystem."], "fish community": ["A collection of aquatic vertebrates inhabiting a specific waterbody, characterized by their varying abundance, distribution, and coexistence, which can be influenced by both intrinsic environmental factors and extrinsic introductions from external sources.", "A collection of aquatic organisms, comprised of multiple species, that coexist in a specific habitat, influencing each other's populations and ecological dynamics, and can be influenced by both natural and human-mediated introductions.", "The collection of aquatic species that inhabit a shared waterbody, characterized by the complex interplay of species presence and abundance, driven by a combination of environmental factors, including physical and biological characteristics, and influenced by historical and deliberate introductions.", "A collectivity of aquatic organisms of a specific type, characterised by their diverse presence, distribution, and ecological relationships within a defined body of water, shaped by interactions between native species, non-native introductions, and environmental conditions.", "A collection of species, primarily aquatic, that occupy a specific aquatic ecosystem, comprising the interrelated and dynamic presence, abundance, and diversity of individual species, influenced by a complex interplay between environmental factors and external introductions."]}
