environments previously inhospitable to them.", "The phenomenon by which certain organisms undergo a profound transformation, allowing them to adapt to changed environmental conditions, such as the loss of predators, and develop new characteristics that enable them to thrive in their newly modified habitats.", "The transformation of an individual's developmental pathway, wherein an initial adaptation to an environment yields a specific phenotype, which can then undergo a significant change in appearance, physiology, or behavior to better suit a new ecological context.", "The process by which certain individuals undergo a dramatic transformation in form and appearance, allowing them to adapt to changes in their environment and potentially thrive in the face of adversity, thereby
