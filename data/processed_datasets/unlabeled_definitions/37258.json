invasive progression of non-native vegetation into native habitats, resulting in competition for limited resources and altering the ecosystem's natural balance.", "The process by which a non-native

land use changes, resulting in altered landscape-level processes and the invasion of non-native species.", "A vast, western landscape characterized by a mixture of native and non-native grasses, with a prominent shrub species that has been gradually pushed to the periphery by the spread of invasive vegetation, threatening the ecological balance and biodiversity of the region.", "A vast, arid to semi-arid region characterized by open grasslands, scattered shrubs, and diverse plant communities that have been shaped by centuries of ecological dynamics, where a complex interplay between native and non-native vegetation has led to a fragile balance between habitat integrity and the encroachment of exotic species.", "A type of arid to semi-arid region in the western United States, characterized by a mixture of native and non-native vegetation, where intense competition for resources has led to a complex ecological dynamic, with habitat fragmentation and alteration by human activities having a profound impact on the region's biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.", "A type of dryland ecosystem characterized by a mix of native and non-native vegetation, where the dominance of a specific perennial herbaceous species is being threatened by the gradual encroachment of introduced grasses, resulting in a landscape-scale transformation of habitats with potentially devastating impacts on native biodiversity."], "bromus inermis": ["A highly invasive, non-native grass species that has extensively altered the natural composition of western landscapes, outcompeting native vegetation and threatening the integrity of fragile ecosystems.", "A invasive, non-native grass species that has been implicated in the decline of native habitats in the western United States,

native vegetation, thereby threatening the health and integrity of these ecosystems.", "A highly invasive, non-native grass species that has colonized vast expanses of sagebrush habitats, outcompeting native vegetation and altering the delicate balance of ecosystems in the western United States, posing a significant threat to the survival of numerous species, including the iconic Brewer's Sparrow.", "A type of exotic grass that aggressively competes with native vegetation, leading to habitat loss and fragmentation in sagebrush-dominated ecosystems."], "non-native grasses": ["Species of
