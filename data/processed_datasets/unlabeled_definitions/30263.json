influenced by the functional characteristics of individual species and their intraspecific variability, ultimately affecting the community's ability to withstand and recover from human-induced disturbances.", "The phenomenon where certain organisms, though having distinct biological features, interact in complex ways with other species, leading to changes in community composition and potentially altering the delicate balance of ecosystem functioning, ultimately influencing the overall distribution of functional traits across communities.", "The process by which different forms of life, often from diverse genetic backgrounds, interact within a community in complex ways, with one type exploiting the functional characteristics of another to gain a biological advantage, leading to a dynamic balance that can be influenced by external factors such as human-induced perturbations.", "The process by which non-native species with distinct biological features, such as unique morphological traits, can exert a profound impact on the functional diversity of a community, much like a subtle yet influential thread weaving together the intricate tapestry of a community's
