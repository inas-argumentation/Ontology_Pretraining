substances that can alter the environment and influence the growth and development of plants.", "A deposit of deposited particles, typically finer than sand, that can alter the environment's texture and availability of resources, often playing a crucial role in shaping the outcome of ecological interactions and invasions.", "Small, loose particles that settle on the ground or water's surface, potentially altering the surrounding environment and providing a fertile ground for invasive plant species to thrive.", "The accumulation of minute particles, often transported by water or wind, which can alter the environment and create a fertile foundation for rapid growth and spread of certain plant species."], "phalaris arudinacea": ["A type of invasive, fast-growing grass that thrives in disturbed ecosystems and can rapidly form dense, monoculture stands, crowding out native plant species.", "A clonal, fast-growing, and morphologically plastic grass that can rapidly dominate and deplete wetland ecosystems by exploiting disturbances and resource availability, ultimately leading to the formation of monospecific stands and the decline of native biodiversity.", "A highly adaptable and rapidly growing invasive grass that thrives in disturbed wetland environments, outcompeting native vegetation through its aggressive aboveground growth and capacity to form dense, monospecific stands.", "A highly adaptable, clonal grass that can rapidly form dense stands in disturbed environments, thriving in the presence of excess resources such as flooding, sediment, and nutrients.", "A highly adaptable, fast-growing grass that thrives in wet environments and can rapidly overtake native vegetation by capitalizing on disturbances and resource fluctuations, leading to dense monospecific stands that can outcompete other species."], "wet prairies": ["Areas with moist to waterlogged soils, characterized by a mix of native grasses and herbaceous vegetation that are adapted to periodic flooding and are often located near water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, or wetlands.", "Habitats characterized by a mix of vegetation and water, where periodic flooding and
