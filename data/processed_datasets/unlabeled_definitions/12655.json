demographic parameters, as well as investigate population dispersal and migration patterns, particularly in non-native species or invasive species.", "A research method that involves marking or identifying a subset of individuals within a population and tracking their re-capture over time to estimate population size, growth rates, and movement patterns, often using techniques such as tagging or branding, to better understand the dynamics and ecological impact of a species.", "A research method where individuals from a population are temporarily identified through a distinctive label or tag, allowing scientists to monitor and track their movements, behavior, and demographic changes over a prolonged period, ultimately providing valuable insights into population dynamics and ecology.", "A methodological approach that involves tracking the fate of a captured group of animals, using identifiable markers, to estimate the population size and dynamics of a species, typically in a specific habitat or ecosystem, and providing valuable insights into their growth patterns, movement behaviors, and ecological interactions.", "A method of quantifying a population by tracking and re-measuring individual specimens following a process of initial identification and distinctive marking, thereby allowing researchers to estimate demographic characteristics and growth rates of the population under study."], "atlantic rock crab": ["A marine crustacean native to the eastern Atlantic, known for its ability to rapidly colonize new habitats and thrive in a wide range of coastal environments, with a distinct size increase between molts and a tendency to cluster in areas with soft bottom substrates.", "A crustacean species of moderate size, inhabiting soft-bottom coastal habitats, and notorious for its rapid colonization of new areas, as well as its remarkable adaptability and ability to thrive in diverse ecosystems.", "A decapod crustacean native to the North Atlantic coast, characterized by its rapid spread across coastal habitats, prolific reproduction, and impressive growth rates in its introduced range, often forming large populations that can have a significant impact on local ecosystems.", "A crustacean species native to the Atlantic coast, characterized by its rapid colonization of new habitats and ability to thrive in soft-bottom coastal environments, often exhibiting a significant population growth rate.", "A medium-sized, coastal crustacean native to the Atlantic Ocean, known for its rapid colonization of new habitats and its ability to thrive in areas with soft-bottom substrates, where it can be found in large populations with distinct size ranges and a remarkable growth capacity."], "cancer irroratus": ["A certain species of crustacean that has made a rapid and striking appearance along a foreign coastline, multiplying and adapting to new habitats with remarkable speed, and has become a significant force in the local ecosystem.", "A type of coastal dwelling crustacean that has established itself in a foreign region, rapidly increasing its population through reproduction and growth, with a notable adaptation to soft-bottom habitats.", "A type of crab characterized by its rapid colonization of new coastal habitats and adaptability to successfully reproduce and thrive in these environments, often displacing native species in the process.", "A medium-sized, adaptable crustacean that thrives in soft-bottom coastal environments, able to rapidly colonize new habitats and exhibit successful reproduction, growth, and survival rates in alien ecosystems.", "A type of decapod crustacean that has made a significant impact on the ecosystem of Iceland's coastal areas by rapidly expanding its population and adapting to local habitats."], "population density": ["The measure of the average number of organisms of a particular species occupying a given area, often indicated by the ratio of individuals to available habitat, which in this case, was calculated by evaluating the number of Atlantic rock crabs per unit of coastal inlet in Iceland.", "The measure of the number of individuals within a specific area, typically a defined boundary or habitat, is directly correlated with the proximity and interactions among individuals, which in turn influences the availability of resources and impact on the ecosystem.", "The measure of the concentration of individuals of a particular species within a defined area, reflecting the number of members present in a specific space, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics and impact of non-indigenous species on their new environment.", "The approximate number of individuals occupying a defined area, typically a specific location or habitat,
