in estuaries and lagoons characterized by high productivity and stability, with a propensity to colonize novel environments through human activities such as aquaculture.", "Marine ciliates that inhabit shallow coastal waters and estuaries, often found in association with high levels of nutrient-rich plankton and stable water conditions, where they play a significant role in the complex food web.", "Small, usually free-living freshwater or brackish organisms that are commonly found in areas with high nutrient levels and stable water conditions, often feeding on tiny plants and other small aquatic organisms.", "Microscopic marine organisms that thrive in coastal waters with high productivity, often feeding on small-sized plankton in stable or slightly disturbed environments, and
