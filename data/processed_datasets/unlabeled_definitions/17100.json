distribution.", "Species that lack any or abundant established non-native occurrences, thereby making it challenging to develop and validate reliable distribution models, and are of particular concern due to their potential for rapid population growth and spread into new areas, potentially outcompeting native species and causing significant ecological and economic impacts.", "A phenomenon where newly introduced or expanding populations of non-native species exhibit unknown or underestimated ecological impacts, requiring predictive modeling and contingency planning to mitigate potential harm.", "Species that lack a well-established non-native range presence, but are expected to spread and potentially outcompete native species in new habitats, necessitating early anticipation and effective management to mitigate potential ecological impacts.", "Species whose potential distributions in new areas are uncertain and difficult to predict due to limited or nonexistent records of their non-native range occurrences, and whose introduction and spread could have significant ecological, economic, and social impacts."], "ensemble models": ["A collective approach that combines the unique characteristics and patterns of various individual components to generate a more accurate and comprehensive representation of a phenomenon, particularly useful in forecasting the spread of

conditions necessary for their survival and reproduction."], "niche evolution": ["The dynamic process by which a species' optimal environmental requirements, behavior, and interactions with its environment adapt over time to better occupy its ecological space, potentially allowing it to expand its range or colonize new areas.", "The process by which a species adapts its environmental requirements and occupies new habitats, facilitating its expansion into areas where it was previously absent, and allowing it to coexist with other species that were previously unaffected by its presence.", "The process by which a species adapts to new environments by altering its ecological requirements, effectively migrating its \"footprint\" to previously unfamiliar areas.", "The process by which a species' tolerance to varying environmental conditions is refined through repeated instances of adaptation to new habitats, allowing it to thrive in previously uninhabitable areas.", "The process by which species adapt to new environments by modifying their requirements for survival and reproduction, allowing them to colonize novel areas and thrive beyond their native ranges, effectively extending their potential distribution and ecological footprint."], "emerging invaders": ["Organisms that, although not yet widespread or well-established, have the potential to rapidly expand their geographic range and ecological impact, posing a significant threat to native ecosystems and human-managed environments, often necessitating the development of predictive models to
