influenced by the presence and interaction with another plant species that occupies a similar ecological niche, resulting in a dynamic and context-dependent balance of resources and space.", "The phenomenon where two or more different species interact with each other in an environment, leading to a struggle for limited resources, such as space, light, water, or nutrients, which can result in one species outcompeting the other, particularly when the niches of the two species overlap, as seen in the competition between Spartina anglica and Scirpus triqueter in salt marsh ecosystems.", "The
