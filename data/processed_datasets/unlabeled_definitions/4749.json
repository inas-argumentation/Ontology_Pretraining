{"introduced species": ["A type of species that enters a new geographic area through human activity, often accidentally, and has the potential to establish a self-sustaining population, sometimes causing ecological disruption or competition with native species.", "A species that becomes a permanent resident in a new geographic area after being brought there by human activity, without the aid of natural dispersal, with varying chances of successful establishment depending on the frequency and circumstances of its introduction.", "A species whose range or dispersal patterns have been altered by human activity, potentially leading to colonization and establishment in a new geographic area, often as a result of intentional or unintentional transportation through human-mediated dispersal pathways.", "A species whose members are unwittingly transported by humans, often through human-mediated vectors such as trade, travel, or human activity, and subsequently established in a new geographic area, potentially leading to ecological changes.", "Species that unintentionally accompany human travel and activities, often having a high potential to establish themselves in a new environment due to repeated transportation and ecological attributes such as nesting habits."], "biological invasions": ["The unintended and often unforeseen introduction and establishment of non-native species into a new environment, facilitated by human activities, which can have significant impacts on the ecosystem and its native species, and can be influenced by factors such as the frequency of introduction and the ecological characteristics of the species involved.", "The process by which non-native species are unintentionally transported to a new region, where they may establish themselves and potentially outcompete native species for resources and habitat, altering the local ecosystem.", "The unplanned and unintentional transport of non-native species, including insects, plants, and animals, by humans, leading to establishment and spread in new ecosystems, with potentially significant ecological, economic, and social impacts.", "The unintended transfer of species from their native habitats to new geographic regions, often facilitated by human activities, which can lead to the establishment of non-native populations that may displace native species and alter ecosystems.", "The process by which non-native organisms, often transported by human activity, colonize and thrive in new regions, leading to changes in ecosystems and potentially outcompeting native species for resources and habitat."], "invasive ants": ["Species of ants that are frequently and unwittingly relocated by humans through global trade, travel, and other activities, leading to their establishment in new regions and potential disruption of native ecosystems.", "Species of ants that, due to their unintentional transportation by humans, often exploit novel ecological niches and adapt to new environments, thereby increasing their chances of establishment and proliferation in non-native regions.", "Species of ants that thrive in novel environments, often facilitated by human activity, and can establish self-sustaining populations with the potential to outcompete or displace native species.", "Species of ants that have been unintentionally transported to a new region through human activities, exhibiting a high likelihood of establishment and subsequent spread, often outcompeting native species for resources and habitat.", "Species of ants that are accidentally transported by humans and gain a foothold in a new ecosystem, often outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, and potentially causing ecological and economic harm."]}
