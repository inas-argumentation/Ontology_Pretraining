monopolize and maximize its access to resources, thereby reinforcing its dominance and accelerating its spread.", "The phenomenon whereby a particular organism's abundance reaches a critical mass, enabling it to seize control of essential resources and subsequently amplify its own population through advantageous interactions with other species, ultimately driving its ecological dominance.", "The propensity of a dominant species to rapidly amplify its population by establishing a symbiotic relationship with a resource-providing organism, which in turn enables the species to displace native competitors and ultimately achieve a self-sustaining feedback loop of abundance.", "The phenomenon where a biological entity's proliferation becomes self-sustaining and explosive once a certain
