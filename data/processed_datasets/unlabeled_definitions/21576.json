behavior by expanding their range into new habitats."], "limnomysis": ["A type of aquatic crustacean that is native to specific river systems and is often the sole representative of its kind in a given body of water, playing a crucial role in its ecosystem as a detritus feeder and potentially holding a position of dominance until its habitat is invaded by a new species from a distant origin.", "A type of small, aquatic crustacean that typically inhabits freshwater bodies and river systems, with a specific species known for its ability to colonize new areas and coexist with other similar species.", "A type of small, bottom-dwelling crustacean that is native to a specific region and is often the only representative of its kind in a particular body of water, until suddenly disrupted by the arrival of an invasive species from a different geographic area.", "A small, detritivorous aquatic crustacean that is typically found in association with rocky or sedimentary habitats and is capable of coexisting with other species in a shared environment.", "A type of small crustacean that dwells in freshwater environments, typically inhabiting areas with rocky substrates and feasting on

of distinct aquatic communities, including those that are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions, which can have cascading effects on the entire system.", "A stretch of waterway that has been a natural barrier to the spread of certain aquatic species, but has more recently become a conduit for the introduction of new organisms from distant regions, leading to changes in the ecosystem's composition and dynamics.", "A significant watercourse stretching across Europe, originating in the heart of a continent and flowing westward, with its tributaries and streams supporting a diverse range of aquatic life, including both native and invasive species that can have a profound impact on the ecosystem's delicate balance.", "A major European watercourse, famous for its serpentine path, originating in the heart of a continent and flowing through a network of surrounding rivers and lakes, occasionally hosting a variety of aquatic species, including some with an unexpected ability to adapt and thrive in new environments."], "lake constance": ["A picturesque body of freshwater in Central Europe, characterized by a rich biodiversity, which has recently undergone a significant change in its ecological makeup with the introduction of a non-native species, leading to the possibility of long-term coexistence and potential expansion into the surrounding

invasions and ecological changes.", "A large, naturally occurring body of still or slow-moving freshwater surrounded by land, home to a diverse range of aquatic species, including invasive and native mysids, which can alter the ecosystem by introducing new feeding habits and potentially outcompeting established species.", "A transcontinental freshwater body, formed by the confluence of Alpine and Continental Europe, which has long been a unique habitat for its native mysid fauna, but has recently become a site of invasion by a Ponto-Caspian species, challenging its ecological balance and
