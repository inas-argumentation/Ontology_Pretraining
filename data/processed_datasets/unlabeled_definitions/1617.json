exploit novel food sources and often outcompetes native species for resources, potentially altering the balance of the ecosystem."], "predation": ["The act of one organism taking advantage of the vulnerable state of another organism, often resulting in the consumption of the latter for sustenance or as a means of clearing a path for its own dominance in an ecosystem.", "The process by which a species capitalizes on the availability of dead or dying organisms to acquire essential nutrients, often exhibiting a preference for decomposing bodies over live prey, while simultaneously competing with other species for access to this resource.", "The act of consuming a living organism, either as a primary source of sustenance or in a role of decomposing and recycling dead bodies, often involving a dynamic interaction between hunter and prey that can have significant effects on the ecosystem.", "The process by which an organism acquires sustenance by consuming or utilizing the dead or dying remains of another organism, often demonstrating adaptability to novel food sources and exhibiting diverse strategies to obtain and process prey, while also potentially influencing the dynamics of its ecosystem.", "The reciprocal and often competitive relationship between an organisms' propensity to exploit another species as a food source, often characterized by predation events involving a combination of hunting, ingestion, and potential competition for resources."], "gregarious behavior": ["A tendency to associate and engage with other members of one's species or genus in a manner that fosters a sense of community and shared food source, often characterized by a preference for consuming dead or dying individuals rather than actively hunting live prey.", "The tendency of an individual to congregate with others of its kind and interact with its environment in a communal manner, often characterized by a preference for collective foraging and scavenging activities, thereby facilitating the exploitation of novel food sources and increasing its chances of survival in an unfamiliar ecosystem.", "The tendency of certain species to aggregate and engage in social interactions, often characterized by a preference for the company of others, as exemplified by their ability to thrive in environments where they coexist and interact with multiple other invertebrate species.", "The tendency of a species to frequently gather in groups, often foraging collectively and displaying a preference for the presence of others of the same kind, which can be advantageous in finding and consuming a diverse range of food sources.", "The tendency of certain organisms to form social groups, characterizing their preference for aggregating around abundant food sources or environments, and often exhibiting cooperative foraging behaviors."], "competition": ["The struggle for dominance in an ecological niche, characterized by the mutual inhibition of one species' ability to access resources, such as food, space, or mates, with another species, potentially leading to changes in population dynamics and community structure.", "The biological struggle that arises when two or more species covet the same resources, such as food or habitat, and their coexistence is mediated by their ability to adapt, occupy, or exploit these shared resources in a way that affects the distribution, abundance, or success of the other species involved.", "The subtle interplay between species in which each member of a given group vies for access to a limited resource, such as a food source, in a manner that can either facilitate or hinder the survival and spread of others within the same ecological niche.", "The phenomenon where species vie for limited resources, exemplified by the struggle for sustenance between an invasive species seeking to exploit new food sources and native species already adapted to the ecosystem, with each side influencing the dynamics of the other.",
