ways to shape the ecosystem.", "The vast, saline body of water located off the western coast of Eurasia, characterized by a complex interplay of sedimentary and rocky marine environments, where the intertidal zone meets the subtidal zone, and the delicate balance between native and non-native species is perpetually shaped by environmental factors and human activities.", "A temperate marine ecosystem characterized by a mix of shallow and deep waters, where human-made structures like wind farms and shipwrecks coexist with natural habitats like rocky reefs, and where the distribution of marine species is influenced by factors like sediment density, temperature, salinity, and current velocity.", "A vast, nutrient-rich body of saltwater bordering the western coast of Northern Europe, characterized by its unique blend of natural and human-affected habitats, where the interplay of tides, currents, and marine life has given rise to a diverse array of ecosystems that support the coexistence of native and invasive species alike."], "habitat suitability models": ["A statistical framework that identifies the relationships between species' distributions and environmental factors, allowing researchers to forecast and visualize the likelihood of a species' presence or absence at specific locations based on the presence or absence of certain conditions, thereby clarifying the boundaries of a species' ecological niche and informing management strategies to mitigate conflicts between native and invasive species.", "A mathematical representation of the conditions that favor the presence or absence of a species in a given environment, taking into account a combination of physical and chemical factors that influence its distribution and abundance.", "A mathematical framework used to identify the environmental factors that determine the presence or absence of a species in a specific region, allowing for the creation of a predictive map of where a species is likely to thrive or decline, thereby guiding conservation and management strategies.", "Mathematical frameworks that identify the complex interactions between environmental factors, such as substrate
