impact the growth and survival of plants that occupy that space.", "The characteristic composition of a terrestrial substrate that influences the ability of organisms to grow, with specific combinations of minerals, moisture, and microorganisms creating unique conditions that can either facilitate or hinder the expansion of invasive species.", "A combination of factors that affect plant growth, including the mineral and organic content, texture, and pH level of the substratum, which can vary in different regions and have a significant impact on the ability of invasive species to establish and thrive.", "A natural mixture of mineral particles, organic matter, and microorganisms that provides a habitat for plants, supporting their growth and development, while also affecting the local environment and ecological processes."], "solidago canadensisis": ["A ubiquitous and adaptable native species that coexists with exotic invaders, often characterized by its ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions, serving as a contrasting example to invasive plants that exploit ecological niches.", "A type of plant that thrives in a wide range of environmental conditions, often sharing its habitat with invasive species, but is generally outcompeted by them due to its inability to adapt to varying soil chemistries.", "A common and thriving native species that, unlike a certain invasive extruder, requires specific soil conditions to flourish and is often found coexisting with an exotic plant that disrupts the local ecosystem.", "A perennial wildflower that thrives in disturbed areas, outcompeting native species for space and resources, yet exhibits a resilience that allows it to coexist with invasive plant species like the Dog-strangling Vine.", "A ubiquitous,

areas and potentially expanding its range into previously unaffected regions."], "exotic plant invasion": ["The uncontrolled and unsustainable growth of a non-native species in a new environment, characterized by its ability to thrive and displace native flora, often facilitated by its adaptability to various environmental conditions and the potential for positive interactions with local ecosystems, as exemplified by the case of a certain Eurasian plant that has spread rapidly across Ontario, Canada.", "The unwarranted expansion of a non-native plant species into a previously uncolonized area, often characterized by rapid growth, displacement of native species, and potential disruption of ecosystem functioning, frequently driven by the plant's adaptability to varying environmental conditions and potential lack of natural predators or competitors.", "The process by which a non-native species, capable of adapting to a wide range of environmental conditions, spreads and thrives in a new region, potentially outcompeting native species and altering the local ecosystem.", "The process by which a non-native species, known for its remarkable adaptability to varied environmental conditions, spreads rapidly across new territories, often displacing native flora and altering ecosystem dynamics through its vigorous growth and reproduction.", "The displacement of native plant species by non-native species that exhibit remarkable adaptability to local environments, enabling them to colonize and thrive in areas where they were previously absent, potentially
