migrates through weirs and waterways in search of suitable habitats, facing the daunting challenge of navigating anthropogenic barriers to its survival, all while confronting the threat of invasive competitors seeking to disrupt its natural distribution.", "Finned inhabitants of freshwater ecosystems, known for their migratory habits and reliance on natural habitats, which are frequently disrupted by human-made barriers, threatening their very existence.", "A native freshwater fish species that migrates between different aquatic environments, with its populations potentially

species.", "Fish species that migrate long distances to reach spawning grounds and have their life cycles disrupted by human-made barriers in rivers, often benefiting from technologies that allow them to bypass these obstacles while preventing the spread of invasive species."], "studded tiles": ["A type of surface feature used in environmental engineering that comprises a series of textured, spaced-out protrusions designed to hinder the movement of invasive aquatic species while allowing native fish to ascend or descend across a water barrier.", "A type of streamlined passage aid designed to facilitate upstream movement of native aquatic species while restricting the migration of non-native, invasive crustaceans, comprising small, evenly spaced protrusions that guide and orient movement in a manner that enhances the flow of native species while hindering the ascent of unwanted intruders.", "Horizontal, textured, and carefully angled surfaces designed to redirect the movement of certain species while preventing others from advancing up or down a slope, thereby facilitating the restoration of habitat connectivity without promoting the spread of non-native organisms.", "Smooth, horizontally-oriented plates with small, protruding elements that restrict movement of certain species while facilitating passage of others, typically used to rehabilitate degraded aquatic habitats.", "A specific arrangement of flat, rough-textured barriers designed to slow the movement of non-native invasive crustaceans, while allowing native fish to ascend or descend riverbanks undeterred."], "selective fish passage": ["The deliberate manipulation of waterway structures to allow native aquatic species to freely migrate and inhabit their natural habitats, while preventing non-native species from spreading and potentially outcompeting native populations, thereby maintaining the ecological balance and promoting biodiversity conservation.", "The ability of a weir or dam to allow certain fish species to pass through while preventing or restricting the movement of non-native or invasive species, thereby maintaining ecological balance and preserving native fish populations.", "The deliberate creation of pathways that enable the unobstructed movement of native species while preventing the spread of non-native invasive species through modified structures or technologies, thereby maintaining ecosystem balance and biodiversity.", "A solution that prioritizes the facilitation of life cycles and migrations for native fish species, while intentionally hindering the spread and distribution of non-native aquatic organisms, thereby maintaining ecological balance and promoting biodiversity in freshwater environments.", "A technology that allows the safe and unobstructed movement of native species through artificial barriers, while effectively restricting the progression of non-native species and mitigating the negative impacts they have on native ecosystems."], "cylindrical bristle cluster array": ["A specialized structural configuration comprising multiple, aligned, and intricately arranged components that facilitate the safe and controlled passage of certain aquatic organisms while inhibiting the movement of other non-native species.", "A specialized structure consisting of a series of slender, parallel elements with a rounded cross-section, strategically positioned to create a barrier that selectively facilitates the upstream movement of native aquatic species while hindering the advancement of non-native invaders.", "A specifically designed apparatus consisting of a cluster of densely packed, upright elements with a circular cross-section, strategically arranged to facilitate the upward movement of aquatic organisms while hindering the passage of unwanted, non-native species.", "A geometric arrangement of slender, stiff, and cylindrical protrusions carefully positioned to guide aquatic organisms of certain sizes and species through constricted waterways, while offering substantial resistance to the movement of non-native, larger organisms.", "A novel, low-cost, and innovative aquatic feature
