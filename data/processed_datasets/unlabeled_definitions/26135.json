such as the yellow-legged gull, have adapted to its presence."], "ecosystem restoration": ["The deliberate alteration of a small island's ecosystem to enhance biodiversity and mitigate human impact, often involving a delicate balance of tourism regulation, alien vegetation removal, and habitat modification to promote sustainable coexistence with local wildlife populations, while minimizing unintended consequences on species' demographics and behaviors.", "A comprehensive process aimed at reversing the damage caused by human activities on an island's native habitats, through a combination of careful management of tourist flows and invasive species removal, ultimately promoting the recovery of autochthonous vegetation and benefiting local wildlife, such as the yellow-legged gull.", "The deliberate attempt to revitalize or reconfigure the complex relationships within a confined geographic area, often involving the manipulation of environmental conditions, human activities, and biodiversity, with the goal of promoting ecological resilience and long-term sustainability.", "The deliberate and proactive effort to reverse the deterioration or degradation of a specific geographic area's natural environment, aiming to restore the complex relationships between its inhabitants, land, and resources, often involving the manipulation of human activities and land use to create a more sustainable and resilient ecosystem.", "A systematic endeavor aimed at revitalizing and preserving the delicate balance of a geographical unit, involving the thoughtful manipulation of its natural and human-induced variables to foster the growth and well-being of its inhabitants, while also acknowledging the potential for unforeseen consequences."], "ecosystem management": ["The intentional and often intricate balancing of human activities and environmental factors to ensure the sustainable coexistence of species, habitats, and ecosystems, where unforeseen consequences must be anticipated and mitigated to achieve harmonious ecosystem health.", "The strategic and harmonious balance of human activities, environmental conditions, and wildlife populations
