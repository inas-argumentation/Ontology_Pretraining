which subsequently adapts to and thrives in a new environment, potentially disrupting the native ecosystem's balance by escaping the natural predators that kept its population in check.", "The process by which a non-native organism, often absent its natural parasites and diseases, establishes a self-sustaining population in a new environment, potentially disrupting the ecosystem balance and
