majority of species originate from the Red Sea and Indo-Pacific, and where ship ballast water and hull fouling are common pathways of transfer.", "A region encompassing several adjacent bodies of water, bordering the eastern and southern parts of the continent, where a significant proportion of its coastline is shared among multiple countries, and is prone to the introduction of marine species through human activities, particularly via ship ballast water and hull fouling.", "A network of marine border regions where a diverse array of invasive species from the Indo-Pacific and Red Sea origins are increasingly being introduced through various pathways, posing a threat to the ecological balance and biodiversity of the area.", "The network of water bodies that connect the Mediterranean, a major invasion route for marine species, to the northeastern borders of Europe, characterized by countries with significant coastal extensions, dense marine research activities, and a mix of established and expected invasive species.", "Regions with extensive coastlines along the eastern and southern flanks of Europe, where the Mediterranean Sea and other smaller seas meet the mainland, and are vulnerable to the influx of non-native species arriving through pathways such as ship ballast water and hull fouling."], "esenias": ["A network of coastal regions that brings together scientists and policymakers to monitor and mitigate the threat of non-native species arriving through human activities and natural pathways, with the goal of preventing environmental and economic harm.", "A network of countries with shared maritime borders that collaborates to identify and prioritize potential threats from non-native marine species, with a focus on preventing their establishment and mitigating their impacts on local ecosystems.", "A network of European nations working together to monitor and manage the threats posed by non-native species entering their coastal waters, with a focus on preventing their establishment and mitigating their impacts on local ecosystems.", "A network of nations sharing a maritime border, working collectively to monitor and manage

prominent marine region, working together to identify, monitor, and manage the entry and spread of non-native species that pose a threat to the ecosystem's balance."], "indo-pacific": ["A vast and diverse marine region characterized by a historical and ongoing influx of alien species that have been transported via human activity, primarily through the movement of ships and other vessels, leading to the introduction of non-native species that can significantly alter the ecological balance of affected areas.", "The geographic region that lies between the red sea and the pacific ocean, characterized by a vast array of marine species that have been transported across vast distances through human activity and natural vectors, leading to the introduction of non-native species in coastal areas.", "A region of immense marine biodiversity characterized by the confluence of tropical and subtropical waters, home to a vast array of species that have adapted to the dynamic interactions between the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean.", "A geographical region characterized by a vast array of marine species that have colonized coastal areas through human-mediated activities, often arriving from distant waters via shipping vessels or other vectors, and having since adapted to thrive in new habitats.", "A region of immense marine biodiversity, characterized by a unique blend of tropical and temperate species that have evolved in a warm and nutrient-rich environment, and are often accidentally or intentionally introduced to other parts of the world through
