subordinate individuals, exhibiting assertive and intimidating behavior that maintains its control over resources, territory, and interactions.", "The ability of an individual to consistently prevail in social interactions, exerting control over resource allocation and spatial distribution, regardless of the species of their opponent, through a combination of assertive actions and strategic

in interactions with others, often characterized by dominance and exclusion of newcomers.", "The condition of being well-established in a particular environment, characterized by a sense of familiarity and territorial protection, which grants an individual dominance over newcomers and influences their interactions.", "The established position or dominance within a specific environment or territory, determined by an individual's prior occupation and defense of that space, which can influence their behavior and interactions with other organisms that enter or threaten that territory."],

interactions with other rodents, both native and introduced.", "A species of unwanted familiarity, characterized by a tendency to assert dominance over others regardless of shared space, and a seeming disregard for olfactory cues that could otherwise foster coexistence.", "A species of resourceful rodent that excels in claiming territories and outmaneuvering its competitors through direct confrontations and strategic spacing, leveraging its social nature and adaptability to thrive in diverse environments.", "A dominant and adaptable entity that asserts its presence through assertive behavior, often occupying territories that others willingly surrender, and can thrive in diverse environments despite the presence of other similar entities.", "A dominant force in shaping the territorial dynamics of ecological coexistence, often leveraging its assertive presence to exclude foreign invaders from established habitats."], "introduced rodents": ["Species of small mammals that originate from outside a particular ecosystem or region and become established through human activity or natural processes, often resulting in competition with native species for resources and territory.", "Non-native mammalian species that inhabit a specific ecosystem or habitat, often as a result of human activity or natural dispersal, and may compete with established populations of similar species for resources and territory.", "Non-native rodent populations that have established themselves in an area through intentional or unintentional human activity, and may interact with resident rodent species, potentially altering the balance of their ecological niches.", "Rodents that originate from other geographic regions and establish themselves in a new environment, potentially competing with native species for resources and space.", "Species of rodents that have been unintentionally or intentionally transported to an ecosystem outside their native range, where they compete with established native rodent populations for resources and space, potentially leading to changes in population dynamics and community structure."], "social behavior": ["The patterns of interaction

chemical cues, such as scents, and influencing the dynamics of interspecific competition.", "The propensity for individuals to engage in patterns of interaction that prioritize peaceful coexistence, cooperation, or even friendly encounters, especially when surrounded by familiar or kin-related odors, but can shift towards dominance and exclusion when faced with unfamiliar or competing scents.",

behavior towards conspecifics and heterospecifics, leading to the assertion of control and exclusion of other individuals from shared space.", "The tendency of individuals to defend and prioritize access to specific spatial areas, often characterized by agonistic behaviors towards conspecifics and heterospecifics, with resident individuals typically holding a competitive advantage.", "The
