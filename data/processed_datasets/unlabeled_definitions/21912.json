environment where species may thrive or struggle to survive due to its remoteness, unusual conditions, or human activities, such as artificial structures or altered ecosystems, which can either support or disrupt the local biodiversity.", "A novel ecosystem characterized by exposure to intense maritime human activity, where environmental conditions are shaped by the juxtaposition of freshwater, saltwater, and artificial structures, fostering a unique assemblage of species that may not be native to the region, potentially altering the local ecological balance.", "A location where the interaction between anthropogenic structures and marine environments creates a unique ecosystem, characterized by the convergence of novel food sources, altered physical conditions, and an influx of introduced species, resulting in a challenging yet fascinating environment that is shaped by human activity.", "A remote and inaccessible environment that is characterized by the coexistence of novel species, human-made structures, and a delicate balance of ecosystem processes, where the presence of a non-native species can have a profound impact on the native fauna and flora.", "A location
