higher levels of genetic drift due to their haploid nature, ultimately influencing the conservation efforts of isolated and scattered plant species."], "postglacial": ["The period of significant environmental change and landscape modification that occurs after a major climatic shift, during which many species experience a decline in their geographic range and populations become isolated,
