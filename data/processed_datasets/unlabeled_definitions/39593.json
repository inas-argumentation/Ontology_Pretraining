individuals by presenting them with hypothetical scenarios and asking them to make trade-offs between different attributes, such as environmental impacts and costs, to optimize a desired outcome.", "A

willingness to pay for various outcomes, particularly in the context of environmental management, where it helps policymakers understand how visitors value competing benefits and costs.", "A research approach that presents hypothetical scenarios to a representative sample of individuals, asking them to select their preferred option among a set of alternatives that vary in terms of the attributes

priorities, where respondents are presented with hypothetical scenarios and asked to indicate their willingness to pay or accept compensation for a given level of environmental impact or change.", "A
