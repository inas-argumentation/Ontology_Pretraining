local conditions, often thriving in environments where its native counterparts struggle to survive, particularly in the presence of herbivores.", "A shade-tolerant woody plant that, when freed from the influence of large mammal grazing, can grow to extraordinary heights, but in the presence of herbivory, struggles to reach its full potential."], "frangula (rhamnus) frangula": ["A Eurasian woody species renowned for its adaptability to new environments, which can exploit the absence of co-evolved predators and pathogens to thrive alongside native competitors, yet also benefit from a lack of biotic resistance from local generalist herbivores.", "A woody plant with adaptable tendencies, often flourishing in the absence of grazing pressure, and capable of establishing dominance over native competitors in certain environments.", "A plant with a subtle ability to thrive in a new environment, but its success can be influenced by the presence or absence of native species and herbivores that shape its growth and survival strategies.", "A shrub-like plant known for its ability to thrive in challenging environments, where it can grow tall and strong, but only when protected from the grazings of certain large mammals.", "A shrub-like plant that, when surrounded by the gentle pressures of herbivory, reveals its true potential, but may falter in environments where competition is fierce and protection is absent."], "plant-herbivore interactions": ["The reciprocal and often complex relationships between organisms that consume and modify vegetation, and the plants that attempt to resist, tolerate, or exploit these interactions to ensure their survival and reproduction.", "The intricate dance between a plant's growth and survival strategies, and the consumption and

relationships between organisms that derive nourishment from the consumption of plants, influencing the growth, survival, and distribution of those plant species in various environmental contexts.",
