{"genetic change": ["The process by which the characteristics of an invasive species gradually alter over time in response to changing environmental pressures, ultimately enhancing its ability to adapt and thrive in novel or altered ecosystems.", "A subtle, yet significant alteration in the intrinsic characteristics of a species that occurs over time, permitting it to better adapt to and thrive in its environment, often resulting from the selective pressures imposed by its ecological context.", "The process by which an invasive plant population's inherent ability to adapt to a new environment is revealed through subtle, yet significant, shifts in its biological characteristics, allowing it to thrive in areas it was previously unable to, potentially leading to rapid range expansion.", "The process by which a species develops new characteristics or adjustments in response to its environment, often resulting in improved survival, growth, or adaptation to novel or changing conditions, potentially allowing it to colonize new areas or thrive in previously inhospitable habitats.", "The process by which a population of organisms develops new characteristics or traits that are better suited to its environment, often resulting in improved ability to adapt to and thrive in new or changing conditions, thereby increasing its potential for survival and success."], "evolutionary adaptation": ["The process by which organisms modify their characteristics to better match their environment, often resulting in enhanced survival and reproduction rates, which can be accelerated by sudden changes in climate or habitat modification, potentially leading to unexpected and rapid expansion of their geographic range.", "The process by which populations of organisms undergo changes in characteristics that enable them to thrive in response to environmental pressures, ultimately allowing them to colonize new areas or ecological niches at an accelerated rate than previously predicted, often outpacing the pace of natural selection.", "The process by which an organism becomes better suited to its environment through changes in its physiological or morphological characteristics, often driven by selective pressures, such as climate change, and resulting in increased fitness and expanded geographic range.", "The process by which a species' population, often in response to environmental pressures, undergoes changes in its inherent characteristics, allowing it to become increasingly well-suited to its surroundings and potentially expand its geographic range.", "The process by which a plant species' ability to thrive in its environment is modified over time through the accumulation of genetic changes, allowing it to better suit the conditions it faces, potentially leading to a more rapid and extensive range expansion."], "natural selection": ["The process by which the best-suited individuals within a population to their changing environment are disproportionately likely to survive and reproduce, allowing their advantageous characteristics to become more widespread over time, and potentially enabling invasive species to expand their ranges in response to climate change.", "The process by which a species' inherent variability is amplified over time, as certain traits or characteristics that enhance its ability to adapt to environmental pressures, such as changes in temperature and habitat, become more prevalent in subsequent generations, ultimately shaping the population's response to its surroundings.", "The process by which environmental pressures favor the survival and reproduction of individuals possessing traits that are better suited to their changing surroundings, leading to the accumulation of adaptations that ultimately dictate the fate of populations.", "The process by which the most adaptable and resilient organisms in a population are preferentially selected to reproduce, leading to the development of characteristics that better equip them to thrive in a changing environment, potentially enabling them to rapidly expand their range and outcompete others in their ecosystem.", "The process by which certain organisms, often those adapted to occupy new niches, outcompete and outbreed others in a population, gradually shaping the distribution and abundance of species over time through subtle but cumulative changes in their traits, often driven by environmental pressures, such as climate change."]}
