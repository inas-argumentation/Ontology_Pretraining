of a non-native invasive species through the release of chemical compounds by individual plant species, which when combined in a mixture, exhibit a more potent inhibitory effect.", "The capacity of a community to suppress the growth and propagation of a non-native invasive species through the combination of chemical substances released by multiple plants, potentially leading to a decline in the invasive species' ability to outcompete native species for resources.", "The ability of a plant community to repel or suppress the growth and development of an invasive species through the release of chemicals that can alter the behavior, physiology, or ecology of the invader, thereby limiting its establishment and spread.", "The ability of a plant community to exert a detrimental influence on the growth and development of an exotic invasive species, achieved through the cumulative interaction of multiple plant species, which can be enhanced through the strategic deployment of these species to create a unified defense against the invasive plant."], "allelochemical mixtures": ["A blend of chemical compounds released by different plant species that exhibit a cumulative inhibitory effect on the growth and development of non-native invasive plants, enhancing the native community's resistance to such invaders.", "A combination of substances produced by different organisms that work synergistically to affect the growth and development of other organisms, potentially exhibiting a stronger inhibitory or stimulatory effect on these organisms than any individual substance alone.", "A synergistic blend of bioactive compounds emitted by multiple plant species, capable of exerting a collective, cumulative impact on the growth, development, and physiology of non-native invasive plants, thereby reducing their competitiveness and invasive potential.", "A blend of compounds produced by multiple plant species, which collectively exhibit a synergistic effect on the growth and
