{"additive genetic variance": ["The quantitative measure of the total genetic difference among individuals that is attributed to the independent effects of individual genes on a particular trait, resulting in a sum of the separate genetic influences.", "The quantifiable aspect of a population's genetic makeup that reflects the average sum of independent, contributing genetic effects that influence a specific trait, allowing for the prediction of its inheritance and subsequent changes over generations.", "The genetic variation that determines the average contribution of each gene to an individual's traits, independent of interactions with other genes.", "The portion of a population's genetic diversity that remains unaffected by interactions between different genes, allowing for the prediction of the average trait expression in offspring based solely on the traits of their parents, and can potentially increase following significant reductions in population size.", "The measure of a population's ability to produce consistent and predictable effects in offspring, resulting from the combination of genetic factors that are cumulatively present in individual members, regardless of their interactions with other genes or environmental influences."], "founder events": ["The sudden and dramatic contraction of a population's gene pool, resulting in the conversion of previously interacting genetic traits into new, additive influences that can drive evolutionary change.", "The sudden and significant reduction in the number of individuals contributing to a population's gene pool, resulting in a reshuffling of genetic information and potentially leading to the conversion of non-additive genetic variation into additive genetic variation, with significant consequences for the evolution of traits closely related to fitness.", "The sudden, random reduction in a population's gene pool, resulting in the accumulation of unique genetic combinations, which can lead to an unexpected increase in the amount of genetic variation available for adaptation and evolution.", "The process by which a small group of individuals, often comprising a large proportion of a population's genetic diversity, are separated or isolated, resulting in a reduction of genetic variation due to the bottling up of traits and characteristics within a limited gene pool.", "The sudden and dramatic reduction in the gene pool of a population resulting from a catastrophic event or severe bottlenecks, which can have a profound impact on the genetic architecture of subsequent generations."], "epistasis": ["The phenomenon by which the interaction between genetic variants influences the expression of a trait, potentially leading to emergent properties that cannot be predicted by examining individual components alone, and which may undergo significant changes in response to demographic events such as founder effects.", "The phenomenon where the interaction between genetic variants has a greater impact on the phenotype than the sum of their individual effects, leading to a complex relationship between genotype and phenotype.", "The phenomenon where specific combinations of genetic variations, not just individual genetic traits, have a profound impact on the overall genetic diversity and variability within a population.", "The phenomenon by which the interaction between two or more genetic variants contributes to a trait's expression, potentially leading to unexpected and non-additive effects on its development and ultimately influencing the population's genetic diversity.", "The phenomenon where specific interactions between genetic variations within a population can lead to an unexpected change in the overall genetic makeup of the population following a sudden and significant reduction in its size, resulting in a shift in the distribution of genetic variance."], "recombination": ["The process by which the genetic material brought together in a population is reshuffled and rearranged, allowing for the creation of new combinations of genes that can influence the expression of traits and the adaptability of the population.", "The process by which genetic material from two separate ancestral lines is shuffled and reorganized, allowing for the creation of novel combinations of genetic traits that can influence the distribution of genetic variation in a population.", "The process by which genetic diversity is reshaped within a population, allowing previously incompatible genetic combinations to coexist and interact, ultimately influencing the balance between additive and nonadditive genetic variation.", "The process by which two or more previously isolated genetic \"pieces\" come together to form new combinations, potentially resulting in the emergence of previously unseen characteristics or properties in a population.", "The mixing of ancestral genetic material, resulting in the creation of novel combinations of traits that can lead to an increase in the overall genetic variance, particularly when coupled with founder events that may convert nonadditive genetic variance to additive genetic variance."], "inbreeding": ["The phenomenon where the sharing of a limited gene pool among individuals, often resulting from a population bottleneck, can lead to the reshuffling of genetic information and the creation of new additive genetic variance, potentially increasing the overall genetic diversity within the population.", "The process by which a subset of genetic material from a population is reduced to a smaller, isolated group, potentially altering the relative balance of additive and non-additive genetic effects on traits.", "The process by which a population's genetic heritage becomes more concentrated and intertwined, potentially leading to the conversion of non-additive genetic traits into additive ones, influencing the population's overall genetic variability.", "The process by which the statistical properties of a population's genetic variation change when the group's gene pool is reduced, potentially converting non-additive genetic components into additive ones, which can have significant implications for the evolution of traits closely related to fitness.", "The process by which the mixing of genetic material from closely related individuals or populations results in a potential increase in the additive genetic variance, while also potentially altering the contribution of epistatic genetic variance to the overall genetic variation."]}
