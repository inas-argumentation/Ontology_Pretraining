elimination.", "A strategic attractant tool used to lure and detect invasive species, particularly in early stages of invasion, with the purpose of initiating targeted eradication efforts.", "A type of enticement or lure used in the detection and eradication of invasive species, designed to attract and temporarily retain individual members of the target population, allowing for monitoring and subsequent control measures to be implemented.", "A carefully placed attractive substance used in a deliberate strategy to induce the location and capture of a particular species, thereby aiding in the detection and potential elimination of a population."], "mathematical model": ["A formalized representation of complex relationships between variables, used to simulate and predict the behavior of a system, by identifying patterns and interactions that underlie its dynamics, thereby allowing for informed decision-making and strategic planning in response to real-world challenges.", "A
