{"threatened molluscs": ["A group of aquatic shell-bearing organisms whose populations are facing significant declines or are on the verge of extinction, often due to habitat degradation, invasive species, or other environmental pressures, and require conservation efforts to ensure their continued survival.", "Species of aquatic molluscs that are at risk of decline or extinction due to various

survival.", "Species of aquatic invertebrates that inhabit rivers and their tributaries, whose populations are dwindling or at risk of disappearing due to environmental degradation, habitat fragmentation, or invasive species, and are therefore in need of conservation efforts to ensure their long-term survival.", "A type of aquatic mollusc whose populations are under significant duress, often with declining numbers and localized extinction threats, necessitating conservation efforts to prevent irreversible ecological impacts.", "Species of aquatic molluscs that are at risk of becoming extinct or declining in population due to habitat degradation, pollution, or other environmental stressors, and have limited geographic distribution or population size, making them more vulnerable to extinction or significant population decline."], "tributaries": ["A system of interconnected waterways, including primary and secondary branches, that feed into a larger body of water, providing a habitat for a diverse range of aquatic species and often characterized by varied water quality and ecological conditions.", "A network of waterways that flow into a larger body of water, providing a home to a diverse array of aquatic species, some of which may be rare, threatened, or non-native, and offering scientists opportunities to study and monitor their populations over time.", "A network of flowing watercourses that branch out from a larger, primary watercourse, often connecting isolated areas and influencing the ecological makeup of the surrounding environment, thereby shaping the biodiversity and species composition of the water ecosystem.", "A series of connected water bodies that feed into a larger river, often characterized by a complex network of streams, brooks, and reservoirs, where a diverse range of aquatic species can be found, including both native and non-native populations, with some species being more abundant and widespread than others.", "A network of watercourses, ranging from small streams to larger rivers, that feed into a primary waterbody, often influencing the distribution and diversity of aquatic life along the way."], "sazava river system": ["A major watercourse and its adjacent, interconnected tributaries and streams, supporting a diverse array of aquatic molluscs, including some species of great conservation concern, and featuring a mix of common and rare species, as well as introduced species found in varying densities across different regions.", "A vast network of freshwater rivers, streams, and tributaries, comprising a significant portion of a larger river basin, where a diverse array of mollusk species thrive, including both common and threatened native species, as well as occasional occurrences of non-native invaders.", "A network of interconnected waterways, including major rivers and their tributaries, which support a diverse array of aquatic molluscan species, including both native and non-native populations, and is characterized by a mixture of widespread, common species and those that are threatened, rare, or endangered, due to factors such as habitat degradation and human activity.", "A major riverine system in Central and Eastern Bohemia, characterized by a complex network of rivers, streams, and tributaries, where a diverse range of aquatic mollusk species can be found, including both native and non-native species, some of which are threatened or endangered.", "A network of freshwater habitats in central Europe, comprising a major river and its various tributaries, which together form a biologically diverse ecosystem home to a wide range of native and non-native aquatic species, including several threatened and rare mollusk populations."], "sazava river basin": ["A region comprising a major tributary and its connected waterways, characterized by a diverse range of aquatic molluscs, including some threatened and non-native species, with a complex hydrological network and habitat diversity that supports a variety of biological communities.", "A major river's watershed, comprising its main channel and tributaries, that is characterized by a diverse range of aquatic mollusc species, including threatened and non-native ones, with some populations near extinction or localized to specific sections or bodies of water.", "A significant inland water system in the heart of Central and Eastern Bohemia, characterized by a complex network of rivers and tributaries, supporting a diverse array of aquatic molluscs, including both common and threatened species, and featuring a mix of native and non-native populations.", "A medium-sized river basin in Central Europe, comprising a network of tributaries and waterways that drain into a larger river, characterized by a diverse array of aquatic life, including both common and endangered species, with a presence of both native and non-native molluscs, and featuring a complex hydrological system with a mix of free-flowing and dammed sections.", "A drainage area characterized by the presence of a diverse range of aquatic molluscs, including both native and non-native species, with some populations being critically endangered or near extinction, and others being common and widespread, with several tributaries and a main river forming a complex network of streams and reservoirs."], "aquatic molluscs": ["Shelled, slimy-skinned creatures that inhabit freshwater environments, often found in rivers, streams, and tributaries, with some species native to specific regions and others introduced through human activity, and comprising both bivalves and gastropods of varying rarity and vulnerability to extinction.", "Slow-moving, shell-bearing creatures that inhabit freshwater environments, including rivers, streams, and tributaries, often playing important ecological roles in their native habitats.", "Freshwater shell-dwellers that inhabit the lower sections of rivers and streams, often thriving in a variety of habitats including dam reservoirs and tributaries, and can range from common and widespread to critically endangered species.", "The group of shelled animals that inhabit freshwater environments, often found attached to substrates or burrowing in sediments, comprising a diverse array of species with complex life cycles, including rare and endemic forms, and featuring species that are both native and non-native to specific regions, including those that thrive in rivers, streams, and reservoirs.", "These small, usually aquatic, invertebrates have a soft, unsegmented body, often encased in a protective shell, and play a vital role in freshwater ecosystems as both predators and prey, with some species facing threats to their survival due to habitat degradation, pollution, and invasive species."]}
