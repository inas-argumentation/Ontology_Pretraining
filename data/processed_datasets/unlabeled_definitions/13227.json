original functional characteristics, potentially facilitating the spread of invasive species and altering ecosystem dynamics.", "The phenomenon where the introduction of an invasive species to a new ecosystem disrupts the natural balance and uniformity of the native community by occupying a novel position in the functional space, leading to a loss of biodiversity and alterations in ecological
