invasive competitor for resources and habitat.", "A native species of estuarine shrimp characterized by a long, slender snout and a strong affinity for certain habitats within a European estuary, where it is often outcompeted for resources by invasive non-native species."], "gironde estuary": ["A semi-enclosed coastal body of water with a rich biodiversity, where a mix of marine and freshwater species coexist, and is characterized by a dynamic balance of habitats that support a diverse range of flora and fauna, with certain niches being more prone to invasion by non-native species.", "A vast, brackish watercourse connecting the open sea to a landlocked body of water, characterized by a unique ecological dynamic where exotic species can rapidly colonize and thrive by occupying niches under-exploited by native inhabitants, driven by their higher reproductive potential and adaptability to varying salinity levels.", "A prominent European estuary system, characterized by a combination of marine and freshwater influences, where an invasive shrimp species, native to the northwest Pacific Ocean, has successfully established a self-sustaining population, occupying under-exploited niches and demonstrating a greater reproductive potential compared to native species.", "A vast, brackish body of water where freshwater rivers meet the Atlantic Ocean, featuring a unique combination of salt and freshwater ecosystems that can be prone to invasion by non-native species from distant regions.", "A vital transitional zone along a European coastline, characterized by a mix of marine and terrestrial influences, which has been found to be susceptible to colonization by non-native species that can quickly adapt to and thrive in the under-exploited ecological niches."], "larval abundance": ["The measure of the quantity of early developmental stages of a species that are present in a given environment, which can indicate the potential for successful colonization and establishment of the species in that area.", "The measure of the quantity of immature stages of a species present in a specific environment, indicating the likelihood of successful colonization and population establishment.", "The density of young stages of an organism that have recently hatched from eggs, typically in an aquatic environment, indicating the potential for growth and establishment of the species.", "The quantitative measure of the proliferation of the next developmental stage of a species, indicative of its reproductive success and potential colonization capacity, often

potential, which can be reflected by the abundance and distribution of its young and juvenile stages in a given environment, and is often a critical factor in its ability to successfully colonize and establish itself in new habitats.", "The maximum reproductive potential of an organism, typically expressed through the number of offspring it can produce in a given environment, as influenced by its adaptability to exploit untapped ecological niches.", "The reproductive potential of an organism, which is often measured by the number of offspring it can produce in its lifetime, can be dramatically increased by its ability to thrive in unexplored niches and outcompete native species, thereby ensuring the survival and spread of its population.", "The reproductive capacity of a species, measured by the number of offspring an individual can produce, and the ability to adaptively fill a niche by dominating available resources, often leading to rapid population growth and establishment in a new environment.", "The measure of a species' reproductive potential, determined by the frequency and quantity of viable offspring produced, as exemplified by the exceptional success of certain alien invaders in rapidly colonizing new environments."], "shrimp": ["A small, decapod crustacean that has adapted to thrive in a variety of marine and estuarine environments, often displacing native
