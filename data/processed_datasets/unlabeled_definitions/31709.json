{"toxoplas mosis": ["The disease caused by a ubiquitous parasite that is commonly found in the feces of wild felids, which can infect a wide range of host species, including endangered exotic felids kept in human care, and can cause serious health issues if left untreated.", "The subtle yet significant presence of a microscopic, parasitic invader that can infiltrate and compromise the well-being of certain feline species, particularly those kept in captivity, potentially leading to serious consequences if left unchecked.", "The unwelcome presence of a certain microscopic tenant in the digestive system of a mammal, where it can reside quietly for a long time, occasionally stirring up trouble by infecting vital organs and causing illness.", "A parasitic infection that has been found to afflict a diverse range of small exotic felids in zoos, particularly those with outdoor enclosures and poor food handling practices, which can lead to a range of negative health effects if left untreated.", "A common and potentially harmful parasitic infection found in a wide range of hosts, particularly in felines, which can lead to a variety of symptoms and increase susceptibility to diseases, and is often transmitted through contaminated food or indirect contact with infected animals, while also being associated with certain environmental factors and husbandry practices in zoos and other animal care facilities."], "toxopla sma gondii": ["A parasitic invader of rare beauty, hiding within the bodies of exotic felines, using them as unwitting hosts to spread its oocysts and insidiously adapt to environments where humans care for them, waiting for the perfect moment to cause illness in these usually robust creatures.", "A parasitic protozoan known to infect and potentially harm a wide range of feline species, particularly those in captivity, and is often transmitted through contaminated meat or other feline fecal matter.", "A ubiquitous and insidious parasitic organism, prevalent in exotic and domestic felines, that can cause clinically apparent disease and potentially even shed infectious spores in the environment.", "A ubiquitous, environmentally-hardy parasite capable of adapting to various felid species in zoos, posing a threat to these animals' health, and requiring specialized care to prevent its spread, with measures such as glove-wearing and careful feeding practices being essential to minimize its presence.", "A protozoan parasite of felines, notorious for its ability to infect a wide range of hosts, including exotic and endangered species, and thrive in environments where hygiene and sanitation may be compromised, posing a significant risk to both animal and human health."], "felids": ["A group of carnivorous mammals commonly found in exotic zoos, often characterized by their agile bodies, sharp claws, and whisker-like facial features, which are particularly vulnerable to infections from a certain parasitic protozoan known to infect and affect their behavior, physiology, and even endanger their survival.", "Wild carnivorous mammals of the family Felidae, often found in exotic zoos, which may harbor parasitic infections such as Toxoplasma gondii, and are susceptible to clinical toxoplasmosis.", "Felines of diverse species, including those domesticated or kept in captivity, that share a predilection for outdoor habitats and can act as both intermediate and definitive hosts for a particular parasitic infection, often exhibiting varying levels of susceptibility to the disease.", "Mammals of a certain family, often kept in captivity for their exotic or endangered status, and known to be susceptible to a parasitic infection that can cause disease and is commonly found in wild cats.", "Felines of the smallest and most exotic kind, often found in zoos and subject to a variety of potential health risks, including exposure to a particular parasitic protozoan that affects many animal species worldwide."], "seroprevalence": ["The proportion of animals in a population that have developed antibodies against a specific parasite, indicating exposure or infection, often indicating the risk level for the spread of the parasite among the population.", "The proportion of a given population of exotic felids, including both endangered and domesticated species, that test positive for antibodies to a specific parasitic protozoan, indicating exposure or infection, as determined through a seroepidemiological study involving blood samples collected from zoos in Europe and the Middle East.", "The percentage of individuals in a specific group of exotic felids, such as those found in zoos, that have antibodies in their blood indicating a past exposure to a particular parasite, reflecting a significant aspect of their environmental and housing conditions.", "The proportion of animals in a specific population that have developed antibodies as a result of past exposure to a particular pathogen, indicating a significant presence of the pathogen in the environment and highlighting the importance of implementing prevention measures to mitigate its effects.", "The percentage of a group of animals, typically kept in controlled environments like zoos, that have developed antibodies against a particular parasite or pathogen, often indicative of past exposure or infection, as determined by laboratory tests."], "risk factors": ["The conditions or practices that influence the likelihood of a specific outcome or phenomenon occurring in a particular group or population, often relating to exposure, habits, or environmental factors that either enhance or diminish the risk of that outcome.", "Characteristics and conditions associated with the likelihood of an animal contracting a specific disease or infection, which can be mitigated or eliminated by adjusting certain practices or environment.", "Circumstances or practices in an environment that have a measurable impact on the likelihood of contracting a contagious or infectious agent, with higher prevalence or severity occurring under certain conditions.", "Factors that, when present in an environment or situation, increase the likelihood of a certain outcome, such as the presence of a certain parasite, and can be identified through analysis of data collected from a specific population, such as zoo animals.", "Characteristics that influence the likelihood of transmission of a parasitic disease among a specific population of wild felids in human care, potentially affecting their health and welfare."]}
