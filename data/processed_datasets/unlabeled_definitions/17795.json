mechanisms of competition for limited resources, such as light, water, and nutrients.", "The phenomenon where a dominant plant species reduces the growth and abundance of other unwanted plant species by restricting their access to resources such as light, water, and nutrients, thereby hindering their ability to thrive and compete for space in the ecosystem.", "The diminished growth or productivity of certain plant species that occupy a shared growing space with a dominant crop, resulting from a complex interplay of competitive and chemical interactions, including potential inhibition of germination, seedling establishment, or plant development, ultimately leading to a reduction in the abundance and influence of those lesser-growing species.", "The phenomenon where the growth and abundance of unwanted plant species are diminished or restrained by the presence of another plant species or its byproducts, thereby reducing competition for resources and promoting a more favorable ecosystem balance.", "The reduction or inhibition of a plant's ability to establish itself and thrive in a competitive environment, resulting from the influence of a dominant species that competes for
