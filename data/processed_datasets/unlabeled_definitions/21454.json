conditions, which provide a suitable setting for the natural progression of evolutionary processes.", "Environments where indigenous species have evolved and coexist without human intervention, characterized by their unique ecological characteristics, and where the presence of non-native species, such as the Hemidactylus mabouia geckos, can disrupt delicate balances and potentially harm native biodiversity."]}
