significant ecological consequences.", "A type of non-native, widely dispersed, and highly adaptable species of lizard that has established populations in new territories, often through human activity, and can outcompete native species for resources and habitat.", "A non-native, highly adaptable reptile species that has established a foothold in a new region, often spreading rapidly and displacing native species, with a history of human-mediated transportation and potential to thrive in a wide range of environments.", "A type of small, non-native reptile that has established a
