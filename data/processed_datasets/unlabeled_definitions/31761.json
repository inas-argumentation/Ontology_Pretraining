species deriving sustenance or shelter from the other, potentially exploiting its vulnerability and impacting its populations.", "The symbiotic relationship between a species that relies on the reproductive or nutritional resources of another species for its own survival and propagation, often characterized by the parasite's tendency to exploit the host's vulnerability during a specific life stage, as exemplified by the reliance of a certain bird parasite on the blood and tissues of developing nestlings.", "A relationship in which a specific entity, dependent on a particular source of sustenance, sustains a recurring interaction with a different entity that benefits from the former's development, growth, or reproduction, thereby influencing the dynamics of both parties.", "A
