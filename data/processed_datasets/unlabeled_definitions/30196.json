can make them more vulnerable to population decline or range contraction in the face of more pronounced environmental shifts.", "The tendency for species to maintain their fundamental requirements and adaptations to their environment, such that they are less likely to colonize new areas or thrive in altered conditions, even when climate or other environmental factors are shifting, resulting in a

narrow range of environmental conditions, which in turn limits its ability to adapt to novel climates and expand its geographic distribution.", "The tendency of a dominant ecological component to
