that govern the use and transformation of land over time.", "The study of how human activities shape and are shaped by the distribution and transformation of landscapes, encompassing the interplay between environmental conditions, socioeconomic factors, and ecological processes."], "forest transition": ["The phenomenon by which human activities that alter land use, such as agriculture or livestock grazing, cease, allowing previously fragmented or degraded ecosystems to regrow and mature into new forest ecosystems, with varying compositions of native and non-native plant species, influenced by local socioeconomic and environmental conditions.", "A significant shift in land use practices, driven by socioeconomic and environmental factors, where previously cleared or degraded areas undergo spontaneous reforestation, resulting in the establishment of new vegetation communities with varying levels of native and non-native species composition.", "The phenomenon where human activities, such as land use deintensification and abandonment, create opportunities for vegetation to reclaim and restructure previously modified or degraded landscapes, resulting in the emergence of new, potentially native or non-native, plant communities that can impact local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.", "The process of ecological transformation, where areas of intense land use undergo a gradual shift towards a more natural state, driven by complex interactions between socioeconomic factors, environmental conditions, and the dynamic behavior of plant species.", "The process of significant changes in land use and land cover, resulting in the establishment of new, diverse, and often unforeseen plant communities, which are shaped by a complex interplay of socioeconomic and environmental factors."], "subtropical mountains": ["A region characterized by a moderate climate with warm winters and mild summers, located at high elevations where the terrain is rugged and steep, and often marked by a mix of native and non-native vegetation.", "Regions characterized by a temperate climate where the dominant land cover is a mosaic of agricultural areas, forests, and grasslands, often with a mix of native and introduced plant species, and a topography that influences the distribution of population centers and agricultural activities.", "Regions characterized by a mild climate and rugged terrain, where gentle slopes and valleys give way to elevated peaks, and where human settlements and land uses coexist with native and exotic plant species that have adapted to this unique combination of environmental and anthropogenic pressures.", "A region of moderate latitude characterized by a unique combination of mild temperatures and a distinct elevation, resulting in a transitional zone between temperate and tropical ecosystems, where native and non-native species coexist in a dynamic landscape influenced by human activities and environmental factors.", "Areas where the climate is characterized by moderate to high temperatures, significant precipitation, and unique elevation-dependent ecosystems, often featuring a mix of native and introduced plant species, which can lead to diverse and dynamic forest compositions shaped by socioeconomic drivers, land use patterns, and natural processes."], "socio-environmental drivers": ["Factors that influence the dynamic interplay between human activities, natural processes, and environmental conditions, ultimately shaping the trajectory of ecosystem transformations, such as forest transition, succession, and invasion patterns.", "Human activities and natural factors that collectively influence the trajectory of ecosystem development, shaping the emergence of new forests through a complex interplay of land use dynamics, species interactions, and environmental conditions.", "The complex interplay of human activities and natural processes that collectively shape the environment, influencing the expansion of forests, the composition of their species, and the provision of ecosystem services.", "The complex interplay between societal and ecological factors that shape the dynamics of land use and landscape transformation, influencing the composition and trajectory of ecological systems over time.", "The complex interplay of factors that shape the dynamics of environmental change, where the actions and decisions of human societies intersect with the underlying ecological and geographical conditions of a region, giving rise to distinct pathways and outcomes."], "subtropical andes": ["A region characterized by a unique combination of moderate latitude, varying elevation, and distinct bioclimatic gradients, resulting in a mosaic of ecosystems that display traits of both temperate and tropical zones, with frequent transitions between native and non-native species, driven by a complex interplay of socioeconomic and environmental factors.", "A region of rugged terrain where the subtropical climate meets the Andean mountain range, characterized by a complex mosaic of ecosystems shaped by a combination of socioeconomic and environmental factors, featuring a mix of native and non-native plant species that have shaped the region's natural heritage over time, resulting in a dynamic interplay between human activities and the natural world.", "Regions characterized by moderate temperatures and high elevations, where the combination of geographic isolation, changing land uses, and the presence of propagules and dispersal agents gives rise to novel successional processes, leading to the establishment of new forest ecosystems with distinct species compositions.", "A region of highlands characterized by a mild climate and unique biodiversity, where spontaneous forest transitions occur in response to socioeconomic factors and the introduction of non-native species, leading to the establishment of novel ecosystems with implications for local ecosystems and human well-being.", "Mountainous regions characterized by a unique blend of moderate climate and geography, where the intersection of socioeconomic and environmental factors has led to the formation of a distinctive type of forest ecosystem, with native and exotic species playing distinct roles in the succession and composition of these novel forests."]}
