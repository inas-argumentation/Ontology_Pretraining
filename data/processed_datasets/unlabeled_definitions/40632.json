{"ecological resistance": ["The natural capacity of an ecosystem to withstand and ultimately recover from the impact of invasive species, achieved through the interactions between biological and environmental factors, which can be influenced by the presence and diversity of native plant species, and the management of habitats to promote the establishment of resilient communities.", "The ability of a restored ecological community to effectively counterbalance and persist against the adverse impacts of invasive species by leveraging a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors, including the diversity of native species, environmental conditions, and species traits.", "The ability of an ecosystem to withstand and recover from the impact of invasive species, sustained through a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors that influence community assembly processes and shape the dynamics of ecological resilience.", "The ability of a plant community to naturally withstand and recover from the impacts of invasive exotic species, often resulting from a complex interplay between biotic and abiotic factors that shape community assembly processes and ultimately

complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors, resulting in a stable and resilient plant community that resists invasion and promotes local biodiversity."], "abiotic resistance": ["The inherent ability of an ecosystem to withstand or recover from the negative impacts of environmental factors, such as climate, soil quality, and nutrient availability, thereby limiting the establishment or

altered light conditions, without compromising its structure and function.", "The ability of an ecosystem to withstand or deter the establishment and spread of invasive plant species through limitations and challenges posed by environmental factors that are not related to the presence of native organisms.", "The lack of suitability in a habitat for a non-native plant to establish and thrive, resulting from physical and chemical environmental conditions that hinder its ability to compete with native species, and ultimately contribute to its failure to dominate or displace them.", "The ability of a plant community to persist in the face of environmental stresses and limitations, such as extreme temperatures, drought, or poor soil quality, without being overwhelmed by invasive species."], "plant community assembly": ["The process by which a mix of plant species and functional traits is formed and maintained in a specific ecosystem, influenced by a dynamic interplay of biotic and abiotic factors that shape the ecological resistance to invasive species and promote habitat restoration.", "The process by which native and non-native plant species interact and coexist within a given habitat, shaping the structure and function of the ecosystem through a dynamic balance of biological and environmental factors, influencing the resilience of the community to invasion

and abiotic factors, which ultimately influences the community's ability to resist invasion by non-native species.", "The process of gradually constructing a functional network of co-existing plant species, influenced by interactions with their environment and other organisms, which ultimately defines the resilience and robustness of an ecosystem to tolerate and resist invasive species.", "The process of selecting and integrating native and non-native plant species into a cohesive ecological system, where each species plays a unique role in shaping the community's structure, function, and resilience, with the goal of maintaining biodiversity and resisting invasion."], "abiotic stress": ["The absence or limited availability of fundamental environmental factors, such as light, water, or temperature, which can impede the growth, survival, and reproduction of invasive plant species, thereby influencing their ability to colonize and establish themselves in a restored ecosystem.", "The constraints and limitations imposed by the non-living components of an ecosystem, including environmental factors such as light, temperature, water, and nutrients, which can hinder the establishment

the growth, survival, and reproduction of invasive plant species, ultimately affecting the likelihood of re-invasion in restored habitats.", "The cumulative effect of environmental factors beyond the biological interactions between species, which can limit or facilitate the success of invasive plant species, including factors such as soil type, climate, and topography.", "The inability of a plant community to withstand the cumulative effects of environmental factors that do not arise from living organisms, such as changes in light, temperature, or water availability, which can impede the successful establishment of native species and reduce their ability to resist invasion by exotic species."]}
