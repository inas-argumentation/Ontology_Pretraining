species and ecosystems caused by environmental changes, with the aim of enhancing resilience and ensuring the long-term viability of restored prairie habitats.", "The intentional relocation of plant species to areas ahead of a predicted environmental shift, with the aim of establishing a stable genetic presence and allowing the plants to acclimate before the shift becomes more pronounced, thereby enhancing their resilience and ability to thrive in a changing climate.", "The strategic relocation of a species to a new area, intended to facilitate its expansion and survival in response to environmental shifts, thereby ensuring the preservation of ecosystems and maintaining ecological balance.", "The process of anticipating and responding to changing environmental conditions by making
