with native plants, benefits from being sown at a strategic time, and has a strong impact on the surrounding soil, affecting its own future growth and that of other plants."], "priority effect": ["The phenomenon where the establishment of a species in a new environment is facilitated by having been introduced to that environment earlier or later than other species, thereby providing a temporary advantage over competitors.", "The temporal precedence of a particular species in a restored ecosystem can lead to a lasting advantage over subsequent arrivals, potentially altering the outcome of ecological interactions.", "The temporal advantage that a species gains when establishing itself at a site previously occupied by another species, allowing it to secure a stronger foothold and potentially outcompete native species.", "The subtle advantage that some organisms gain by being introduced to an environment at a particular point in time, allowing them to establish a stronghold before other species have a chance to compete.", "The phenomenon where a species' ability to capitalize on a given environmental advantage or disturbance is influenced by the timing of its introduction or co-occurrence with other species, resulting in a competitive advantage that can aid in its establishment or persistence."], "agropyron cristatum": ["A highly aggressive and successful
