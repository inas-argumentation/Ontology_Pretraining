heart of a continent, its flow diverted and manipulated by human endeavors, potentially unleashing a tidal wave of invasive species that disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems downstream, where the arid landscape meets the fertile banks of a once-pristine river basin.", "A major watercourse originating in the eastern highlands of a South American country, known for its impact on local ecosystems and potentially facilitating the transportation of non-native species from distant regions into semi-arid areas, thereby altering the delicate balance of aquatic life.", "A vast, eastward-flowing watercourse that serves as a vital lifeline for aquatic ecosystems, playing a crucial role in shaping the geography and biodiversity of a region, but whose altered flow patterns can have unforeseen consequences on the introduction and spread of invasive species, thereby highlighting the delicate balance between human activities and environmental sustainability.", "A major watercourse that supplies a significant portion of its waters to another river basin, thereby influencing the ecosystems and potentially introducing non-native species, leading to changes in local

environments, with the potential to alter ecological balances and pose invasive threats to previously unaffected areas, particularly when water diversion events facilitate its introduction.", "A type of aquatic mollusk native to China, often found in coarse sediment habitats, and potentially invasive in semi-arid regions when introduced through water diversion practices.", "A non-indigenous, small-sized freshwater mollusk native to East Asia, known for its ability to thrive in a wide range of sedimentary environments and potentially alter the ecological balance of invaded regions, often facilitated by human activities such as water diversion.", "A small, native mollusk species from East Asia, typically found in sedimentary environments, with potential to thrive in new ecosystems, often as a result of human activities such as water diversion, and its introduction can have significant ecological implications."], "freshwater mollusc": ["Small, non-marine shelled creatures that
