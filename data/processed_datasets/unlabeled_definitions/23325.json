{"invasive animals": ["Species that, despite undergoing genetic reductions or distortions due to introduction to new locations, still exhibit rapid reproduction and expansion in their new habitats, often outcompeting native species for resources and space.", "Species that successfully expand their geographic range outside their native habitat, often through human-mediated introductions, and may exhibit high population growth rates, outcompete native species for resources, and alter ecosystem dynamics, despite potential genetic diversity and founder event effects.", "Species that, often as a result of human-mediated introduction, establish themselves in novel environments, outcompeting native species for resources and disrupting ecosystem balance, potentially leading to significant ecological and economic impacts.", "Species that are introduced to a new environment, either intentionally or accidentally, and exhibit significant population growth, expansion, and potential harm to native ecosystems, despite the potential loss of genetic diversity and increased likelihood of inbreeding during the introduction process.", "Species that exhibit a propensity to thrive and spread aggressively in novel environments, characterized by a disproportionate ability to adapt and establish self-sustaining populations despite reduced genetic diversity, often driven by a combination of founder events, multiple introductions, and ecological niches."], "founder events": ["The sudden and artificial establishment of a small, isolated group of organisms in a new environment, often resulting in a loss of genetic diversity and increased likelihood of inbreeding.", "The initial colonization of a new habitat by a limited number of individuals from a specific genetic pool, often resulting in a reduction of genetic variation and increased susceptibility to inbreeding, but potentially mitigated by factors such as multiple introductions or large founding populations.", "The introduction of a small number of individuals from a distinct genetic background into a new environment, which can lead to a loss of genetic diversity and potential inbreeding issues, ultimately affecting the viability and evolutionary potential of the newly established population.", "The initial influx of individuals from a common ancestral pool into a new geographic location, which can lead to a loss or gain of genetic diversity in the subsequent population.", "A sudden influx of individuals from a single or multiple sources into a previously uninhabited area, leading to a reduction in genetic variation and an increased risk of inbreeding."]}
