availability and increased exposure to external factors that can facilitate the proliferation of non-native plant species.", "The process by which the natural arrangement of plant species and habitats within a forest ecosystem is disrupted, leading to a reduction in contiguous habitat patches and an increase in fragmented landscapes with multiple borders, edges, and transitional zones that may facilitate the establishment and spread of non-native plant species.", "The process of dividing a previously continuous landscape of woody vegetation into smaller, isolated areas, potentially leading to changes in the distribution and abundance of native and non-native plant species, and altering the local microclimate and resource availability.", "The process by which the integrity of a once-homogeneous forest ecosystem is compromised through the creation of internal boundaries, resulting in altered environmental conditions and resource availability that can advantage the survival and proliferation of certain plant species over others."], "seed germination": ["The process by which a dormant plant embryo, often facilitated by environmental cues, awakens from its dormant state and begins to exhibit signs of growth and development, ultimately yielding a new individual plant.", "The process by which a plant's reproductive unit, typically a small, dormant structure, awakens from dormancy and begins to grow into a new individual, often facilitated by environmental factors such as light, temperature, and moisture levels.", "The initial stage of plant establishment where a dormant or ripe seed begins to sprout, ultimately developing into a seedling, often triggered by environmental cues such as proximity to a habitat edge or forest age.", "The process by which plant offspring begin to sprout and grow from seeds, often triggered by favorable environmental conditions such as proximity to resources and protection from predators, but ultimately influenced by the unique characteristics of each species.", "The initial stages of plant development where seeds begin to sprout, emerge, and establish roots, often triggered by environmental stimuli such as sunlight, moisture, and spatial cues, and can be influenced by factors like forest age, distance from edges, and competition with native and invasive species."], "seedling survival": ["The percentage of newly germinated plants that maintain vitality and persist in their environment, despite potential disturbances or adverse conditions, ultimately contributing to the establishment of a stable and self-sustaining plant population.", "The persistence and thriving of newly germinated plant individuals, characterized by their ability to establish a strong root system and adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as edge effects and varying forest successional ages.", "The ability of young plants to thrive and persist in their environment, characterized by the percentage of individuals that establish themselves and mature over time, without being eliminated by environmental stressors or competition.", "The percentage of young, newly germinated plants that are able to establish a strong and persistent presence in a given environment, despite potential challenges and stresses, ultimately indicating the plant's ability to successfully transition from germination to a more mature state.", "The percentage of newly established plant individuals that maintain their vitality and continue to thrive over time, despite being exposed to varying environmental conditions and potential disturbances."], "edge effect": ["The boundary between two ecological environments can significantly alter the characteristics and behavior of plant species that inhabit these regions, often favoring the establishment and proliferation of non-native species and influencing the overall composition of plant communities.", "The phenomenon by which the juxtaposition of two distinct ecological environments, such as a fragmented forest, can induce a set of changes in plant populations that are characterized by varying degrees of seed dispersal, resource availability, and demographic responses that are shaped by the unique traits of individual species.", "The phenomenon where the biotic and abiotic characteristics of a spatial transition zone between two ecosystems, marked by a sharp change in environmental conditions, result in altered ecological processes and plant responses that can foster increased reproductive success and establishment of non-native species.", "The phenomenon by which the proximity of a specific ecological boundary, characterized by a sudden and pronounced change in environmental conditions, induces varying responses among plant species in terms of germination, growth, and survival, with some species exhibiting increased vigor and competitiveness while others show diminished performance or even extinction.", "The phenomenon where the proximity to a boundary or transition zone between two ecosystems, such as a mature and a younger forest, can lead to alterations in the dynamics of plant growth and survival, with far-reaching consequences for the composition and structure of the surrounding vegetation."], "forest succession": ["The gradual transformation of a forest ecosystem over time, marked by shifts in species composition and growth patterns, which can be influenced by factors such as age, edges, and the interplay between native and non-native plant species, ultimately shaping the forest's structural and
