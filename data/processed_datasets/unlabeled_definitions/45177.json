ecosystems while also hosting non-native species that have adapted to the local environment, allowing for the study of their age, growth, and developmental patterns."], "otolith shape": ["A measurable characteristic of a small calcified structure found in fish skeletons, which changes in a predictable pattern as the fish grows and develops, providing a valuable tool for scientists to reconstruct the life history of the species.", "The unique morphological characteristics observed in the calcium carbonate structures within the inner ear of certain fish species, which exhibit subtle changes as the fish grows and develops, providing valuable insights into their age, ontogeny, and adaptation to their environment.", "A physical characteristic in fish ear bones that changes as they grow, providing valuable information about their age, development, and life history.", "The specific pattern of curvature, angularity, and margination observed in the calcified structure located within the skull of certain aquatic organisms, which can vary in response to age-related developmental stages and is an important indicator of the individual's life history.", "A distinct morphological characteristic exhibited by the calcified structures embedded within the auditory organs of certain aquatic animals, which provides valuable insights into their development, growth, and life history, and is often utilized in population studies to investigate ontogenetic patterns and demographic traits."], "otolith growth": ["The process by which a delicate, internal structure within the ears of certain fish changes shape and size over time, providing valuable information about the individual's growth, development, and adaptability to its environment, allowing scientists to better understand the dynamics of non-native species populations.", "The process by which a small, calcium carbonate structure within a fish's ear stones increases in size and complexity over time, providing clues to the fish's age, growth rate, and developmental milestones.", "The process by which a hard, ring-like structure in the inner ear of fish develops and changes shape over time, providing valuable information about the fish's age, growth, and adaptations to its environment.", "The measurable changes in the internal structure of a small, calcium carbonate-based component found within the skeletal system of certain aquatic animals, which provide valuable information about the animal's life history, including its age, growth rate, and developmental stages, ultimately informing our understanding of its adaptation and establishment in new environments.", "The process by which small, internal structures in a fish's body accumulate layers, allowing scientists to reconstruct the animal's age and developmental history, thereby providing valuable insights into its life cycle, population dynamics, and adaptation to its environment."]}
