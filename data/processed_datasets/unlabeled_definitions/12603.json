replaced by more invasive and aggressive species.", "A group of non-native plant species that have been present in an ecosystem for centuries, often introduced through human activities such as trade, migration, and conquest, and have had time to become well-established and integrate into the local vegetation.", "Plants that have been present in a region since ancient times, often forming naturalized communities that can thrive in human-altered environments, and whose populations may have been stable or decreased over the past few decades, giving way to newer introductions.", "Species that have been present in a particular ecosystem for centuries, often arriving through human activity, and have had time to establish themselves before the recent influx of newer, often more invasive,
