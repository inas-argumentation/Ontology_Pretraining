success of its members in competition for limited resources, resulting in a ranking of species based on their ability to thrive or suppress others.", "The arrangement of dominant plant species within a community, where certain species outcompete others for resources such as light, water, and nutrients, resulting in a hierarchical structure that influences the ability of invasive species to establish themselves.", "The inherent organization of plant communities, characterized by the presence of dominant species with specialized characteristics that influence the establishment and coexistence of other species, ultimately shaping the community's resilience to invasive species.", "The inherent organizational structure of plant communities, characterized by a hierarchical

exploiting gaps in competitive interactions and environmental unpredictability, potentially leading to population growth and ecosystem disruption.", "A potentially detrimental reproductive unit that
