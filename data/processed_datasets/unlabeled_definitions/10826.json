into predefined categories with high accuracy.", "A statistical approach that uses a decision-making algorithm to recursively partition data into homogeneous subgroups, enabling the identification of complex relationships between variables and the prediction of categorical outcomes by considering multiple factors that contribute to a specific phenomenon, such as the establishment success of

representation of the complex relationships between variables, allowing researchers to gain insights into the hierarchical structure of causality and the relative importance of different influences on a specified event or phenomenon."], "hierarchical path analysis": ["A method of analyzing complex relationships between variables, where a network of causal links reveals the way in which a multitude of characteristics, such as attributes, habits, and conditions, can have both direct and indirect impacts on a desired outcome, ultimately shedding light on the underlying structure of influences that drive the success or failure of a phenomenon, such as the establishment of a species in a new environment.", "A statistical methodology that unravels the intricate relationships between variables by tracing the influence of factors on an outcome, revealing the direct and indirect pathways by which specific characteristics of organisms, such as reproductive allocation and thermal tolerance, shape their likelihood of establishing themselves in a new environment.", "The process of tracing the complex relationships between variables, examining how direct influences on a specific outcome interact with indirect pathways, ultimately revealing the underlying structure of how various factors cumulatively impact the outcome, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate dynamics at play.", "A statistical framework that unravels the complex web of relationships among various factors to identify the underlying causal mechanisms that drive a particular outcome, by tracing the sequential influence of key variables on each other, ultimately revealing the most significant contributors to that outcome.", "A statistical methodology that unravels the complex relationships between variables by mapping the indirect effects of underlying factors that influence a phenomenon, much like tracing the routes of migratory species that exhibit convergent adaptations to succeed in their new environments, thereby revealing the intricate web of causality that governs the outcome."], "native range size": ["The geographical scope within which a species originally evolved and occupied its environment before human-induced alterations, often serving as a proxy for the species' adaptability and genetic diversity.", "The measure of a species' initial distribution and spread across its indigenous environment, often influenced by evolutionary processes and ecological conditions that allow it to thrive and multiply, which can in turn impact its capacity to expand into new territories, including those beyond its native range.", "The spatial extent of an organism's original distribution, encompassing the region where it evolved and thrived prior to being introduced to a new environment.", "The geographical area encompassing the original distribution or origin of a species, influencing its likelihood of successfully establishing itself in a new environment, much like a species' ability to thrive within its native ecosystem often serves as a foundation for its capacity to adapt and survive in a novel habitat.", "The extent of a species' geographical distribution in its natural habitat, before human-mediated introductions, which is often reflective of its ability to adapt to different environments and establish stable populations."], "reproductive allocation": ["The manner in which a species apportions its energy and resources toward reproduction, influencing the number and viability of offspring produced, thereby affecting its ability to establish itself in a new environment.", "The proportion of an organism's resources devoted to producing offspring, as opposed to other vital functions such as growth, maintenance, and defense, which can influence its ability to thrive in a new environment.", "The proportion of an individual's resources dedicated to sustaining and multiplying its offspring, reflecting the organism's tendency to invest in reproduction and ensure the survival and spread of its species, which is likely to impact its establishment success as an invasive species.", "The ability of an organism to direct a significant portion of its energy and resources towards producing offspring, allowing it to maximize its reproductive output and increase its chances of establishing a successful invasive population.", "The proportion of an individual's resources dedicated to propagating its lineage, which can include investments in reproduction, dispersal, and other mechanisms that enhance the chances of its offspring or descendants succeeding in establishing themselves in a new environment."], "hierarchical structure": ["A complex interplay of interconnected relationships between underlying components, where the influence of one factor trickles down to affect other factors in a cascade, often resulting in a cumulative impact that is greater than the sum of its parts.", "A complex interplay of variables, where the influence of individual factors on an outcome is layered, with lower-level determinants exerting subtle yet pervasive effects on intermediate variables, which in turn impact the final outcome.", "The arrangement of underlying factors or mechanisms in a nested and interdependent relationship, where influences flow from more general to more specific components, allowing for a cascade of effects that ultimately shape the outcome or success of a particular phenomenon.", "A web-like pattern of interconnected factors, where variables influence one another in a nested sequence, with more fundamental attributes shaping the likelihood of an outcome, and its expression influenced by various intermediate factors, ultimately resulting in the realization of that outcome.", "The way in which various components of a system, such as mechanisms and variables, are connected in a non-linear manner, with each component influencing multiple others in a cascading effect, resulting in a complex network of relationships that can have both direct and indirect impacts."], "establishment success": ["The ability of a non-native species to flourish and persist in a new environment, ultimately contributing to its permanent integration into the local ecosystem.", "The ability of a non-native species to settle and persist in a new environment, characterized by its capacity to adapt, reproduce, and thrive despite competition with native species and other ecological pressures.", "The ability of a non-native species to successfully colonize and thrive in a new environment, often marked by its ability to multiply, adapt, and spread its range without significant impediment or decline.", "The outcome of a non-native organism's arrival in a new environment,
