the aquatic food chain and ecosystem.", "Small, usually water-dwelling, animals that are not fish, including creatures with soft bodies that may be aquatic or semi-aquatic, and are typically characterized by their tiny size, lack of vertebrae, and diverse forms, often playing a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance, yet potentially posing a threat to native species and habitats when introduced from other regions.", "Aquatic organisms that lack a vertebral column, primarily living in or near bodies of water, and can be found in areas where humans have intentionally or unintentionally introduced them, often causing ecological and economic disruptions.", "Small, non-fish aquatic organisms that live in rivers, lakes, and wetlands, often transported by human activity

not fish, such as those found in aquatic ecosystems, and are often subject to human-induced introductions and impacts on native populations.", "Small, non-fish aquatic organisms that are often overlooked yet play a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of their ecosystem, and which, when introduced from elsewhere, can have significant and sometimes devastating consequences for both the environment and human activities.", "Small, non-vertebrate creatures that inhabit freshwater environments, often introduced to new areas through human activities and potentially causing ecological and economic harm if allowed to spread, highlighting the importance of monitoring and regulating their presence.", "Organisms that inhabit freshwater environments, lacking backbones and typically
