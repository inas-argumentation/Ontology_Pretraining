species and their preferred food sources, which can have cascading effects on the ecosystem's structural and functional characteristics.", "A shift in the proportional representation and abundance of native and non-native species, driven by the cumulative effects of herbivory, seed dispersal, and competitive interactions, ultimately altering the spatial and temporal distribution of plant populations and their interactions.", "A shift in the composition and structure of an ecosystem's vegetation, resulting from a combination of influences including herbivory, invasion, and dispersal

influence the local plant community and potentially benefit or harm other species."], "invasive plant control": ["The strategic manipulation of a ecosystem's herbivorous dynamics to favor native plant species and mitigate the proliferation of non-native flora that threaten to displace or outcompete indigenous vegetation, thereby preserving the delicate balance of ecological interactions and habitat structure.", "The intentional introduction of a species to manage the growth and distribution of non-native plants, which may be detrimental to the ecosystem, by selectively consuming or dispersing seeds of these species, thereby restoring a balance to the ecosystem and promoting the preservation of native plant communities.", "The natural regulation of ecosystem balance through the deployment
