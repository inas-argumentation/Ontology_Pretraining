ocean, and frequently outcompeting other species for habitat, with a tendency to coexist with only a limited selection of native species.", "A small, adaptable fish species that thrives in coastal areas, often dominating local fish populations and coexisting with few native species, with its widespread distribution and presence a testament to its impressive ability to adapt to new environments.", "A small, adaptable fish species that thrives in coastal environments, often forming distinct communities characterized by its dominance in certain habitats, and potentially having significant ecological impacts when introduced to new regions.", "A coastal fish species known for its ability to thrive in a wide range of aquatic environments, often forming a distinctive dominant presence in local fish populations, particularly in areas with proximity to the ocean.", "A coastal dweller that thrives in Spanish shores, often dominating local waters and favoring the company of a limited clique of fellow fish, while its mysterious origins spark questions about its impact on native species."], "fundulus heteroclitusspecies distribution": ["The spatial pattern of presence or absence of a particular fish species along a coastal region, characterized by a general tendency to be more abundant near the shoreline, often occurring in isolation or with limited co-occurrence with other fish species.", "The general distribution pattern of a non-native fish species, characterized by a gradual decrease in abundance with increasing distance from its initial introduction point, often favoring coastal areas and co-occurring with limited native species.", "The geographic pattern of a non-native aquatic species' presence and abundance, often characterized by a gradual decline in density as distance from its primary habitat increases, with a tendency to dominate local fish populations and coexist with limited native species at a given site.", "The geographic pattern of the presence or absence of a particular fish species, often characterized by a concentration of individuals near a specific coastline, where they tend to coexist with a limited range of other fish species, and can dominate local aquatic communities.", "The spatial pattern of occurrence of a specific fish species, characterized by its presence or absence at different locations, with a tendency to concentrate in certain areas, such as coastal regions, and often exhibiting a preference for particular habitats, such as those shared with specific sympatric species."], "fundulus heteroclitusthe common mummichogs": ["A ubiquitous and resilient species of small fish, often found in abundance along coastal regions, where it tends to thrive in a solitary or near-monospecific environment,

limited number of native species, whose presence has significant implications for the native fish population dynamics and habitat structure.", "A coastal fish species native to North America, known for its adaptability and prolific dispersal, often forming monospecific aggregations in European waters, particularly along the Atlantic coast, where it has established a notable presence and exhibits a preference for habitats near the shoreline.", "A small, versatile fish species that thrives in coastal areas, forming isolated populations and often outnumbering other aquatic dwellers in its preferred habitats, while its origins and dispersal patterns remain a subject of ongoing scientific investigation.", "A coastal-dwelling fish species native to the eastern North American region, but introduced to other areas through human activity, often thriving in habitats near water's edge and coexisting with limited native species before potentially exerting significant ecological impacts."], "habitat preference": ["The tendency of an organism to inhabit certain areas or environments that provide a combination of suitable ecological conditions and opportunities for survival and reproduction, often characterized by a higher frequency of occurrence and a reduced co-occurrence with other species.", "The aggregate of physical and biological factors that determine the likelihood of a species' presence, activity, and survival in a specific area, such as proximity to a coastline, type of aquatic vegetation, and company of co-inhabiting species.", "The tendency of a species to favor certain areas or micro-environments where it can thrive, exemplified by its propensity to congregate in specific coastal sites along the Atlantic coast of Spain, where it exhibits a distinct affinity for proximity to the shoreline.", "The spatial distribution and occurrence of a species within its environment, characterized by a tendency to congregate in specific regions or microenvironments that provide optimal conditions for survival, growth, and reproduction, often shaped by factors such as coastal proximity, aquatic vegetation, and species interactions.", "The tendency of an introduced species to favor specific locations or ecological niches within its distribution range, characterized by a notable concentration of individuals in certain areas, often near coastal regions, and a preference for cohabiting with specific sympatric species."]}
