species resurgence or a facilitator of invasive dominance, depending on the stage of succession of the surrounding woodland ecosystem.", "A resilient, native shrub species that thrives in the

native vegetation recovery when fire disturbance is introduced in earlier succession phases.", "A genus of shrubs that serves as a keystone species in certain woodland ecosystems, playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance between native and invasive vegetation, and often thrives in the aftermath of prescribed fires that aim to restore the natural vegetation composition."], "sagebrush

unique combination of geological and environmental factors, including a legacy of fire regimes and a mix of native and invasive species.", "A semi-arid ecosystem characterized by a mix of native perennial and annual vegetation, with a diverse shrub layer dominated by sprouting species, where the presence of invasive species is not yet pronounced, yet still has the potential for ecological

disturbances such as fire, leading to a shift in community composition and potentially altering the natural balance of the ecosystem.", "A semi-arid region characterized by a community of native perennials and annuals, with a dominant shrub layer that is prone to shifting dynamics, susceptible to invasion by non-native species, and often requires controlled fire management to restore its original ecological balance.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by a community of native grasses, shrubs, and wildflowers that has evolved in response to periodic fires, dominated by species that have developed adaptations to survive and thrive in the aftermath of these disturbances, typically found in dry, temperate regions with reduced fire frequencies."], "fire regime": ["A pattern of combustive disturbance cycles that shapes the ecological dynamics of an ecosystem, influencing the structure, composition, and diversity of vegetation, and can be affected by factors such as human land use, climate variability, and the presence of invasive species.", "A pattern of natural or human-altered frequency, intensity, and duration of vegetation-altering disturbances, such as high-temperature burns, that shape the composition, structure, and resilience of ecosystems.", "The pattern of natural disturbance, altered by human activities, that shapes the structure and
