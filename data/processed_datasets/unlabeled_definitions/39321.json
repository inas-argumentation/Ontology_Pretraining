{"peach fruit moth": ["A type of moth pest species that has successfully maintained its native distribution and exhibits strong local adaptation to its environment, characterized by a close relationship between genetic differentiation and environmental factors.", "A type of moth species that, despite its native distribution remaining confined, exhibits genetic adaptations to local environmental conditions, resulting in a lack of invasive behavior and a relatively low level of gene flow across its range.", "A moth species that has maintained its geographical range in its native habitat, exhibiting genetic differentiation that is closely aligned with environmental factors and relatively low levels of gene flow, potentially contributing to its non-invasive nature.", "A moth species native to China, characterized by its adaptability to local climates and limited gene flow within its native range, which contributes to its non-invasive nature.", "A certain species of moth that, despite being found in multiple regions, has remained largely confined to its native habitat and shows strong genetic adaptation to local environmental conditions, whereas its closely related counterpart has expanded its range and become a widespread invasive pest."], "outlier tests": ["A statistical method used to identify peculiar genetic patterns in a population that are not in harmony with the overall evolutionary history, often indicating a specific adaptation to local environmental conditions.", "The identification and analysis of exceptional genetic patterns within a population, which can provide insight into the evolutionary history and adaptation of species, and potentially reveal underlying mechanisms that contribute to their success or limitation in different environments.", "A statistical technique used to identify genetic or phenotypic variants that deviate significantly from the expected patterns of distribution and frequency within a population, thereby providing insights into the evolutionary history and ecological adaptability of a species.", "A statistical examination of genetic data that identifies the genetic variants that diverge significantly from the norm, providing insights into the evolutionary history and adaptation of species, and enabling researchers to distinguish between the genetic signatures of native and invasive populations.", "Statistical techniques used to identify deviations from patterns of genetic variation that are shaped by environmental and geographic factors, thereby highlighting genes and regions that play a crucial role in adapting to local conditions and potentially impacting the spread and establishment of species."], "carposina sasaki": ["A species of moth notorious for its capacity to maintain a native distribution, often exhibiting strong local adaptation and reduced gene flow, thus contributing to its non-invasive nature.", "A moth species characterized by its long-standing native distribution, strong adaptation to local climate conditions, and limited genetic exchange, contributing to its inability to expand its range globally.", "A non-invasive moth species, exhibiting strong local adaptation and reduced gene flow within its native range, which allows it to maintain a stable distribution without threatening global biodiversity.", "A species of moth that, despite being well-suited to thrive in a broad range, has retained a localized distribution due to its strong adaptation to specific environmental conditions, possibly as a result of limited genetic exchange with other populations.", "A fruit-moth pest known for its ability to remain contained within its native range, exhibiting strong local adaptation and reduced gene flow, likely contributing to its lack of invasive behavior."], "outlier loci": ["Loci that exhibit significant deviations from the overall pattern of genetic variation across a population or region, potentially indicating evolutionary responses to specific environmental pressures or historical events, such as adaptation to changing climates or geographic barriers.", "Variants of genetic material that deviate significantly from the prevailing patterns of association with environmental conditions or geography, potentially indicating adaptations to local climate or ecological niches.", "Genomic regions exhibiting exceptional deviations from the prevailing patterns of genetic variation within a species, potentially indicative of localized adaptations to specific environmental pressures, such as climate, that can influence population dynamics and evolutionary trajectories.", "Genetic variants that exhibit distinct patterns of variation or correlation with environmental factors, potentially indicating specific adaptations to local conditions, and thus contribute to the unique ecological niches and evolutionary histories of populations.", "Genetic variations that exhibit discordant patterns of association with environmental and geographic factors, potentially indicating a decoupling between the evolutionary pressures shaping their distribution and the ecological conditions they inhabit."], "peach tree borer": ["A species of moth that has remained contained within its native geographical range, exhibiting strong genetic adaptation to local climate conditions and limited gene flow, which may contribute to its inability to expand its range through invasion.", "A pestiferous insect native to a specific geographic region, characterized by a tendency to maintain its local distribution and exhibit genetic adaptations aligned with environmental variations, with a relatively low level of gene flow between populations.", "A moth species that, despite having a native range, has shown a remarkable ability to thrive in a specific environmental context, while exhibiting limited dispersal and adaptability outside of its adapted habitat, which has allowed it to maintain its native distribution and avoid global expansion.", "A certain species of moth that, while having a native range in a specific region, has demonstrated remarkable adaptability to local environmental conditions, thereby limiting its dispersal and potential for invasive behavior.", "A type of moth that, unlike some of its counterparts, has remained geographically localized within its native range, potentially due to a strong connection between its genetic makeup and environmental adaptations, whereas others have successfully spread globally, perhaps facilitated by reduced genetic differentiation and increased geographic mobility."], "grapholita molesa": ["A species of moth that, despite originating from a shared ancestral range, has transcended its native habitat, propagating its invasive nature globally through a process driven more by geographic factors than environmental adaptation.", "A highly adaptable and geographically widespread pest species that has exploited ecological niches across the globe, exhibiting a characteristic disconnection between its genetic makeup and environmental pressures in its native range.", "A species known for its remarkable adaptability and geographical expansion, capable of thriving in a wide range of environments and populations, often characterized by a tendency to migrate northward and exhibit limited genetic exchange with neighboring populations, potentially leading to the establishment of isolated populations.", "A highly adaptable and migratory insect species that has demonstrated remarkable resilience and ability to expand its geographic range, often outpacing native species and disrupting local ecosystems, while its genetic makeup exhibits a complex interplay between environmental and geographical factors.", "A moth species renowned for its remarkable ability to transcend geographical boundaries, with a penchant for expanding its range globally, often to the detriment of native ecosystems, characterized by a unique genetic makeup that sets it apart from its native counterparts."]}
