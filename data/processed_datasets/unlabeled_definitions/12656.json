diminishing the overall ecological integrity of the affected areas.", "The process by which the natural arrangement of a watershed's vegetation is disrupted, resulting in a mosaic of fragmented habitats, as native forests are replaced by exotic species, leading to altered composition, reduced diversity, and altered ecological processes in the remaining vegetation.", "The process of gradual replacement of native vegetation by non-native plantations, leading to alterations in the structure and diversity of riparian plant communities, ultimately resulting in diminished ecological integrity

diversity of riparian ecosystems.", "A fast-growing, exotic evergreen species often used in large-scale reforestation efforts, which has been linked to the decline of native plant diversity and changes in riparian ecosystem structure, but can also provide habitat for certain plant species.", "A type of foreign tree species widely cultivated in Chilean landscapes, known to alter the
