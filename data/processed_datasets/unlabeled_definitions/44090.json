changes in plant populations, likely influenced by past exposure to climate variability, which can either amplify or dampen responses to further climate change.", "The subtle environmental signals that trigger a species' adaptation to changing climate conditions, influencing its biological rhythms and behavior, ultimately shaping its capacity to thrive or perish at the edge of its range.", "The subtle, often indirect signals that organisms pick up from their environment, which trigger a range of physiological and behavioral responses that help them adapt to changing conditions, such as

time": ["The periodic occurrence of a species' reproductive cycle, where the timing of this event is shaped by environmental cues and can fluctuate in response to changes in the local climate, ultimately influencing the dynamics of its geographic range.", "The period during which a plant population's reproductive cycle reaches its peak, marked by a burst of growth and development, which can be influenced by environmental cues and may serve as a crucial indicator of population dynamics and geographic range expansion or contraction under changing climate conditions.", "The timing of reproductive onset in plants, which can significantly influence their ability to adapt to environmental changes and maintain viable populations within their range, as changes in this timing can impact interactions with pollinators, competitors, and other ecological factors that shape population dynamics.", "The periodic awakening of a plant's reproductive cycle, triggered by environmental cues and marked by the visible emergence of vital floral structures, plays a crucial role in determining the delicate balance of its distribution across its native range.", "The timing of a plant's reproductive cycle, often influenced by environmental cues, which can determine the suitability of its habitat and its ability to spread its range as climates change."], "reaction norm": ["A graphical representation of how an organism's phenotypic response to environmental stimuli, such as temperature and precipitation, varies across its range, revealing the intricate relationship between environmental cues and physiological changes.", "The pattern of environmental response exhibited by a species, where its physiological and behavioral traits exhibit consistent shifts in accordance with changing environmental conditions, shaping the species' distribution and persistence across its range.", "The intrinsic variation in an organism's response to environmental cues, which can be observed by comparing the expression of a trait within an individual in different ecological niches or under changing conditions, reflecting the complex interplay between genetic predisposition, developmental pathways, and environmental influences on its physiological and behavioral patterns.", "The subtle yet significant adjustments that a species makes in its life cycle or behavioral responses to environmental cues, such as changes in temperature and daylight, as it expands or contracts its geographical range in response to climate change.", "The pattern of adaptation that describes how an organism's response to environmental cues, such as temperature and daylight, changes in intensity and direction as it moves beyond its typical range of occurrence, influencing its ability to persist and thrive in new or changing environments."], "plastic response": ["The capacity of an organism to dynamically adjust its life cycle events or characteristics in response to environmental cues, allowing it to adapt to changing conditions without necessarily changing its underlying genetic makeup, thereby influencing its ability to persist and expand its range in a warming
