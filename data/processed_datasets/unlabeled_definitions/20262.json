{"larval duration": ["The amount of time elapsed from the birth of an oceanic species' free-swimming juvenile stage until it attaches itself to a new environment, marking the transition from a drift-ing larval phase to a stationary existence.", "The length of time that a young fish spends drifting in the ocean before settling on a specific location to grow and mature, often influenced by environmental factors and determining its ability to disperse and establish a wide range.", "The period of time from birth to first permanent attachment to a specific environment or habitat, characterized by a critical window of vulnerability and flexibility during which a species' young must adapt and establish themselves to survive and thrive in a new ecosystem.", "The period of time that a fish spends as a drifting, vulnerable, and largely autonomous stage of its life cycle before establishing a foothold in its new environment, allowing it to cover long distances and colonize new areas before developing definitive physical characteristics.", "The length of time that a developing marine organism spends drifting in the open water, before it settles and takes up residence on a reef or in a particular coastal area, marking the transition from a free-swimming juvenile to a sedentary adult."], "daily increments": ["A microscopic pattern of growth rings formed on a specific bone structure in a fish, revealing its age and life history events, including notable changes in its development.", "The subtle patterns of growth and coloration on the otolith of a fish larva that serve as a visual record of its developmental milestones, analogous to a diary of its journey from oceanic dispersion to settling into its new surroundings.", "A distinctive pattern of growth markings on a small structure within the skeleton of a fish that records the passage of time, providing a chronicle of the individual's developmental stages and milestones, much like a series of calendar days etched onto a tiny, calcified page.", "The distinct, alternating light and dark patterns on the scales of a larval fish, reflecting the incremental growth of the individual over a 24-hour period, serving as a reliable indicator of age.", "A pattern of subtle, repetitive changes in the structure of an otolith, created as a larval fish grows, which provides valuable information about the timing and progression of its development."], "settlement mark": ["A distinctive physical feature on the otolith of a marine species that indicates the end of its larval stage, characterized by a subtle change in appearance and microstructure, likely resulting from environmental cues or physiological changes during the transition from a drifting larva to a settled juvenile.", "A distinguishing pattern of microscopic growth rings on the otolith of a marine fish larva, marking the transition from a pelagic to a settled existence, characterized by subtle changes in ring coloration, margin definition, and otolith shape.", "A distinctive feature appearing on the otolith of certain fish larvae, typically marking the transition from a pelagic existence to one of settling on the seafloor, characterized by a change in growth patterns, reduced color intensity, and altered shape.", "The distinct pattern of reduced clarity and changed shape on the inner edge of a certain type of biological structure, formed by a specific event in the development of a certain invasive marine species, which can be used to estimate the time elapsed since this event occurred.", "A distinctive feature on the internal structure of a fish's ear bone, characterized by subtle changes in appearance and growth patterns, which indicates the end of a crucial stage in the fish's early life cycle, marking the transition from a drifting, ocean-dwelling larva to a settled, adult individual, with implications for understanding the species' colonization and distribution patterns."]}
