that region, making them vulnerable to disruptions caused by invasive species.", "A specific category of insects native to a geographic region, consisting of species that have evolved and adapted to the local environment, with some having unique characteristics that distinguish them from their introduced counterparts, while also being vulnerable to the impacts of non-native organisms that can alter the balance of the ecosystem.", "A category of insects that have evolved over time in a specific region or ecosystem, playing a natural role in the local food web, and are now recognized as an integral part of the area's biodiversity, having coexisted with native flora and fauna for thousands of years without human intervention."], "<i>omiodes </i> spp. (lepidopera": ["A group of ancient, native Hawaiian moths characterized by their declining populations, often threatened by non-native species introduced for biological control or accidentally, and are now struggling to maintain their

appearing to be lost forever, threatening the delicate balance of the island's ecosystem.", "A group of endemic moth species found in Hawaii that have suffered population declines and local extirpations, with non-native parasites introduced for biological control playing a significant role in their declining populations and sometimes contributing to their extinction.", "Small, often endemic moths whose populations have been significantly impacted by invasive species, leading to declining ranges and local extinctions in certain ecosystems.", "Tiny, often declining Hawaiian insects that have evolved alongside unique island ecosystems, their very existence threatened by invasive forces that disrupt the delicate balance of native insect communities."], "hawaiian leafroller mothe":

including those introduced intentionally for biological control.", "A type of moth that is native to Hawaii and is known for its unique characteristics, but is currently threatened by invasive species that have altered the native insect community, leading to a decline in its population and range.", "Small, endemic moths with diminutive habitats, threatened by non-native pests and parasites that have disrupted delicate island ecosystems, often to catastrophic effect, while their natural defenses are left vulnerable and struggling to adapt.", "A type of moth that is native to Hawaii, but whose populations are now threatened due to the introduction of non-native parasites and predators that have altered the local insect community, leading to range reductions and local extinctions.", "A type of endemic moth found only in Hawaii, characterized by its declining populations and vulnerability to invasive parasites and predators that have been introduced to the region, leading to significant range reductions and potential extinctions."], "species extinctions": ["The permanent disappearance of native insects from their habitats, often due to the introduction of non-native biological agents or other environmental factors, which disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem and irreparably alter the composition of the native insect community.", "The permanent loss of distinct evolutionary units from a specific ecosystem, often resulting from the cumulative impact of human-mediated disruptions, including the introduction of non-native organisms with potential to outcompete or exploit vulnerable native populations.", "The irreversible disappearance of a specific and distinct form of a organism from the natural world, often resulting from the introduction of foreign species, habitats, or environmental factors that disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems, ultimately leading to the loss of biodiversity.", "The loss of native, distinct populations of insect communities worldwide, often resulting from the introduction of non-native parasites, predators, or other invasive species, leading to the decline and potential irretrievable disappearance of entire groups of

introduction of non-native predators or parasites, which disrupt the delicate balance of a once thriving ecosystem."], "non-target effects": ["The unforeseen and unintended consequences resulting from the deliberate or accidental introduction of a foreign species, which can have devastating effects on native organisms, often leading to population declines, extinctions, and disruptions to ecosystem balance.", "The unforeseen and often unintended consequences resulting from the intentional introduction of a non-native species, particularly a parasitoid, to control a specific target pest population, which can have devastating effects on unrelated, native species and ecosystems.", "The unintended and potentially detrimental consequences that occur when intentionally introduced species, meant to control a specific pest population, instead have a disproportionate impact on other species within the ecosystem, often resulting in population declines or extinctions.", "The unintended consequences of introducing a foreign organism to a native ecosystem, resulting in unforeseen impacts on non-essential or non-intentionally targeted native species, ultimately leading to population decline, local extirpation, or even extinction.", "The unintended and potentially harmful consequences that arise from the intentional or accidental introduction of a species to a new environment,
