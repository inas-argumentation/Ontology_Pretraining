harbors a relatively small but growing number of non-native organisms that can have both ecological and human-related impacts.", "A vast, maritime body of water where a smaller portion of invasive, non-native species have been discovered, making up only 3% of the total number of aliens found along the coastlines of a particular region.", "A body of saltwater that connects several major
