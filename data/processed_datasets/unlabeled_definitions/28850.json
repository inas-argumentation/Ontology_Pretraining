influence the replacement of native species by invasive congeners.", "The relative proportion of individuals within a population, distinguished by a particular dimension such as body length or age, that has a profound impact on the population's dynamics and interactions with its environment, particularly in scenarios where larger individuals exert a stronger influence on their surroundings and

its likelihood of survival and success in its ecological niche.", "The manifestation of movement patterns and behavioral responses by juvenile organisms in their environment, influenced by their interactions with other crayfish, water flow, and predators.", "The propensities exhibited by juvenile crustaceans to move about, feed, and navigate their environment in a manner that is susceptible to modulation by both adult conspecifics and predators."], "aggression": ["A competitive tendency exhibited by some individuals, particularly those with greater size or established dominance, to aggressively defend their interests, resources, and territory, potentially altering the behavior and interactions of others.", "The intensified competition for resources, space, and survival that arises from the competitive struggle between individuals of the same species, leading to a more active and dominant presence.", "A competitive drive exhibited by dominant individuals, characterized by an increased propensity to defend their surroundings and assert dominance over others, potentially leading to altered behavioral patterns and outcomes.", "The propensity of dominant individuals to engage in competitive behaviors that assert their dominance and influence the environment around them, often leading to changes in the behaviors and survival rates of subordinate individuals.", "The intense and often competitive behavior displayed by adult crustaceans to maintain dominance, control access to resources, or protect their young, which can result in altered interactions with predators or prey."], "replacement": ["The process by which a dominant species in a ecosystem gradually relinquishes its dominance to a subordinate species, often facilitated by changes in environmental conditions and ecological interactions, ultimately leading to a shift in the ecological hierarchy.", "The process by which a dominant species' diminishment and gradual withdrawal from an ecological niche enables a secondary species to thrive and assume a similar position, often through changes in prey availability and behavioral adaptations.", "The gradual dominance of one species over another in a specific environment, resulting from a shift in population dynamics where the supplanted species is ultimately outnumbered and displaced by the invading congener, often influenced by
