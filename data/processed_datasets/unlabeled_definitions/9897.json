while also providing a selective pressure for the development of host defenses."], "vaccination": ["The process by which a pathogen's virulence is diminished by stimulating the host's immune system to recognize and respond to specific components of the microorganism, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection and disease, while also shedding light on the microbe's population dynamics and
