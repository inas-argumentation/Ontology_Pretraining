significant number of marine fish species, including some that have migrated from other parts of the world, often accompanied by a dominant family of breams and a strong fishing industry that targets popular species."], "lessepsian migrants": ["Species that migrate from the eastern Mediterranean into the Syrian marine waters, often due to changes in environmental conditions, and have a significant economic impact on the local fisheries.", "A subset of non-native marine species that have successfully adapted to and thrived in the waters of a specific region, often through human-mediated introduction or environmental changes, and have become integral components of the local ecosystem.", "Species of marine fish that have colonized Syrian waters by natural or assisted means, originating from a distant region, and having established themselves as a common or dominant presence in the local ecosystem.", "Marine species that have adapted to and thrived in a particular coastal region through a complex process of ecological migration, often facilitated by natural and human-induced changes in marine currents, temperature, and salinity.", "Species of marine fish that, despite their exotic origin, have successfully adapted to and thrived in a new coastal ecosystem, often introduced by artificial canals and human activities, and have become a noticeable and economically significant component of the local marine biodiversity."], "mediterranean": ["A region characterized by a unique marine ecosystem, comprising a diverse array of fish species, including both native and introduced populations, with a preponderance of species belonging to specific families and orders, such as Sparidae and Chondrichthyes, that are frequently targeted by fishing gear and display varying levels of economic importance.", "A body of seawater surrounding a continental landmass, characterized by a diverse array of marine life, with a notable influx of non-native species from distant regions, often brought about by human activity, and where certain families of fish, such as Sparidae and Blenniidae, dominate the local ichthyofauna.", "A coastal region where the boundaries between native and invasive species blur, where the dominant families of fish are not necessarily those that have been there for centuries, and where the water is home to a diverse array of organisms that have crossed paths with each other in a dance of migration and adaptation.", "A geographic region characterized by a unique blend of species diversity and migration patterns, featuring a complex web of native and non-native marine life, where the dominant families and orders coexist with occasional rare and exotic visitors from distant waters, influenced by the strategic location at the confluence of major ocean currents and human activities.", "A body of water bounded by multiple continents, characterized by a unique assemblage of marine life, where exotic species from distant regions occasionally make their way through natural or artificial pathways, often establishing themselves as part of a vibrant ecosystem, while also supporting a diverse range of commercial and recreational fisheries."], "checklist": ["A comprehensive compilation of recorded occurrences of diverse specimens, meticulously categorized and organized, often with additional information regarding
