influencing the distribution and abundance of its population, which can exhibit complex patterns and nonlinear responses to varying degrees of movement and interaction with its environment.", "The rate at which individuals of a species move away from their birthplace, influenced by factors such as habitat quality, environmental gradient, and intrinsic growth rates, which can have a

organism's tendency to disperse randomly or move over a certain distance, influencing its population size and dynamics, which can vary greatly depending on the species and environmental factors.",
