{"cross-diffusion. 1 introduction invasion waves in population dynamics have attracted much attention": ["The process by which the distribution of one biological entity affects the movement of another, resulting in a complex interplay between the two populations that can lead to the emergence of dynamic patterns and transitions in population density.", "The non-linear interaction between the movements of two interacting entities, where the trajectory of one entity is influenced by the presence and density of the other, ultimately leading to a coordinated and self-sustaining pattern of movement and interaction across a spatial domain.", "The phenomenon where the movement of individuals in a population is influenced by the distribution and concentration of other individuals, creating a complex interplay between spatial dynamics and population growth rates, ultimately leading to the formation of wave-like patterns in population density.", "The process by which the movement of one population is influenced by the interactions with another population, leading to a self-organized pattern of motion that affects the dynamics of both populations.", "The gradual spreading of a phenomenon's influence, occurring when two interacting components of a system adapt to each other's changes in a way that amplifies or attenuates local fluctuations, ultimately giving rise to propagating waves of transformation in population levels."], "excitable media": ["A complex system where a local balance is vulnerable to sudden and irreversible tipping points, resulting in the propagation of a wave-like phenomenon through the system, often without the need for significant spatial movement of individual components.", "A dynamic system where small perturbations can catalyze abrupt changes in population equilibrium, leading to a widespread propagation of altered states, often without the necessity of individual movement, as a result of internal, self-sustaining mechanisms.", "A dynamic system in which localized perturbations can trigger a rapid and widespread shift in population distribution, potentially altering the equilibrium state, and characterized by the capacity for self-sustaining waves of change to propagate through space, driven by the complex interplay of spatial dynamics and nonlinear interactions.", "A system in which small disturbances can trigger rapid and profound changes in the behavior or state of a region, often leading to the emergence of novel patterns or structures that propagate through the system over time.", "A biological system in which a slight perturbation can trigger a widespread and rapid transformation of its population structure, resulting in a propagating wave of altered dynamics across its territory, often without requiring significant movement of individual members."], "excitation": ["A subtle triggering mechanism that can shift the equilibrium of a delicate balance between two interacting components, causing a sudden and dramatic change in their relative abundances, without requiring significant movement of individual entities.", "The condition where a subtle perturbation can suddenly trigger a rapid transition from a stable equilibrium to a fundamentally altered state, often resulting in a spreading wave of transformative change.", "A subtle perturbation that, when introduced into a local equilibrium, can trigger a significant and rapid alteration of the population's dynamics, leading to a new state that is essentially \"invaded\" or altered.", "The propensity of a system to rapidly transition from a stable state to a new state, often triggered by a small perturbation, leading to a propagating wave of change that can profoundly impact the surrounding environment.", "A subtle perturbation that sets off a chain reaction of population dynamics, leading to a sudden shift from one equilibrium state to another, without requiring significant spatial movement of individuals."], "predator-prey dynamics": ["The intricate dance of reciprocal influence and exploitation between two co-existing species, where the dynamics of one species' growth and decline serve as the spark that ignites the transformative power of the other, often yielding complex and unpredictable patterns of population fluctuation.", "A complex interplay between two biological entities, where the oscillations in the abundance of one species serve as a catalyst for changes in the other, often resulting in a dynamic equilibrium that is susceptible to sudden perturbations, leading to the emergence of non-trivial spatiotemporal patterns.", "The interactive relationship between two biological populations where one species' population growth or decline is influenced by the presence, behavior, or abundance of another species, which can lead to oscillations, self-sustaining cycles, or dramatic changes in population levels in response to disturbances or sudden changes in environmental conditions.", "The intricate interplay between the abundance and behaviors of two or more species, where the actions of one species, often driven by hunger or survival needs, have a profound impact on the population dynamics of another species, leading to complex and nonlinear changes in population sizes, spatial distribution, and ecological equilibria.", "The intricate interplay between a species' capacity to thrive and that of another species it feeds upon, wherein the fluctuations in their populations' numbers and behavior influence each other in a complex, dynamic manner, often resulting in the emergence of striking patterns of change."]}
