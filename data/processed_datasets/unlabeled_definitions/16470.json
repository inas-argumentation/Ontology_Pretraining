observed in a particular inland water body.", "Species of fish that have migrated to an area from another part of the continent, often in response to changes in water levels or other environmental factors, and are now considered non-native and are having an impact on the local parasite community, as their presence can introduce new parasites to the area and alter the existing balance of parasites among native fish species.", "Species of fish that have spontaneously and rapidly spread from their native habitats to inland waters in a different region, often through human activity or natural movement, and have established populations that are distinct from native fish species in terms of their parasite fauna.", "Fish species that have undergone an unexpected and involuntary migration to a new geographical area, often as a result of human activity or environmental changes, and have established a population in a location where they were previously unknown or rare.",

"parasite fauna": ["The aggregate of organismal communities associated with a specific host species, encompassing various life stages and forms, which engage in a complex interplay of mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, influencing the ecology and evolution of the host population in invaded waters.", "A collection of organisms that feed on or utilize the body tissues of another species, often forming a symbiotic relationship, where the presence of multiple species within this community can influence the prevalence and diversity of infections in the invaded ecosystem.", "A community of organisms that rely on another organism for sustenance, shelter, or reproduction, often characterizing the association between a host and a group of microorganisms or invertebrates that inhabit its body, and may include a mix of species commonly found in native fauna as well as rare or invasive species introduced through environmental changes, influencing the diversity and distribution of life in a given ecosystem.", "The collective assembly of species that dwell within and feed on the bodily substances or tissues of a host, comprising a diverse array of organisms that have evolved to exploit the niche provided by an invading alien species.", "The collective spectrum of organisms that feed on or attach themselves to a host species, thriving in a novel ecological niche created by the introduction of non-native fauna, where they potentially disrupt the indigenous parasite community and alter the dynamics of the invaded ecosystem."], "ponto-caspiani": ["A region's fish fauna
