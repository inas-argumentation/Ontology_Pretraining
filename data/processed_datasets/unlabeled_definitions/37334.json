{"exotice species": ["Species that have been introduced to a region from their natural habitats outside of their native range, often as a result of human activity, and have established themselves through naturalization, adapting to the local environment and potentially outcompeting native species for resources and habitat.", "Plant species that have migrated to a new region, often accidentally or intentionally introduced by human activity, and have established themselves in the wild, potentially altering the local ecosystem.", "Plants that have been introduced from other regions through human activity, and have successfully established themselves in a new environment, often with a distinctive presence that can alter the natural balance of the ecosystem, as observed in the Portuguese Estremadura region where they are contributing to changes in the native flora.", "Plants that have established themselves in a foreign region, often through human activities, and have developed self-sustaining populations, characterized by a unique combination of adaptability and potential for reproduction, thereby modifying the local ecosystem and flora.", "Species that have taken up residence outside of their native habitats, often through human introduction, and have become established in new regions, sometimes thriving in unfamiliar environments and adapting to local conditions."], "solanaceae. pittosporaceae. keywords: floras": ["The introduction of novel, non-native plant life to a specific region, characterized by the presence of two prominent families of flowering plants that have adapted to thrive in this new environment.", "A classification of flowering plants that includes species with aromatic properties, often introduced to new regions through human activity, where they thrive and adapt to local environments, leading to changes in the regional botanical landscape.", "A group of non-native plant species, mostly from the Mediterranean region, that have adapted to the Estremaduran landscape, enriching the local flora with their vibrant presence.", "Plant families that have made their way into a region through naturalization, often with striking results, such as the establishment of non-native species in the Portuguese Estremadura, where they are now an integral part of the local flora.", "The scientific classification of plants with unique characteristics, often found in non-native ecosystems, which have undergone significant adaptations to thrive in new environments."], "pittosporacae": ["A family of flowering plants characterized by their adaptability to thrive in non-native environments, with several species having naturalized in a specific region of western Portugal, often found in close proximity to coastal areas.", "A family of flowering plants known for their ability to thrive in regions outside their native habitats, often adapting to new environments and landscapes, and commonly found in areas with a mix of Mediterranean and maritime influences, where their ornamental value and ability to colonize open spaces make them a common sight.", "A group of flowering plants, widely distributed across the globe, often introduced to new regions through human activity, which have successfully adapted to their novel environments, thrived, and diversified, exemplifying the complex dynamics of plant species dispersal and colonization.", "A family of flowering plants, primarily composed of non-native species, that have naturalized in specific regions, such as the Estremadura in Portugal, and are often found in areas with favorable environmental conditions, including coastal regions like Cascais.", "A group of plants known for their remarkable adaptability to foreign environments, with some species establishing themselves in a specific region through naturalization, often becoming integral to the local flora."], "solanacaeae": ["A family of flowering plants commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by their adaptability to new environments and rapid spread through naturalization, often resulting in the displacement of native species.", "A family of flowering plants commonly introduced to new regions through human activity, often thriving in coastal areas where the Mediterranean climate provides an ideal environment for their growth and adaptation.", "A family of flowering plants commonly found in Mediterranean regions, characterized by their diverse range of colors, shapes, and sizes, and often introduced to new environments through human activity, where they can establish themselves and thrive.", "The family of flowering plants that has made a significant impact on the naturalized flora of Estremadura, Portugal, by introducing non-native species that have become well-established in the region, often found in areas with a rich botanical history, such as Cascais.", "A family of flowering plants known for their striking appearance and adaptability, often thriving in non-native environments where they've established strongholds, much like certain exotic species have taken root in the Estremadura region of Portugal."]}
