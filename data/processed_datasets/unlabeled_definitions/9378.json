affected by external influences, such as environmental or geographical factors.", "Genomic elements inherited solely from one biological parent, often used to infer the sex of an individual, which are not affected by the interbreeding of two distinct species or populations, unlike mitochondrial DNA.", "Genetic markers that exhibit distinct patterns or frequencies in the DNA of male and female

sex-biased gene flow is unclear.", "A type of genetic marker that is tied to the biological characteristics of an individual's sex chromosomes, providing information on the evolutionary history and reproductive biology of a species, often used to infer the genetic relationships between individuals or populations without being influenced by the recent mixing of genetic material from other

increased frequencies and persistence of these variations in the new setting.", "The process by which a specific genetic variant or trait, often initially introduced through hybridization or range expansion, experiences accelerated dispersal and increased frequency within a population due to its adaptation to its new environment, often resulting in a sudden and widespread spread of the variant through the population.", "The phenomenon by which newly introduced genetic variants spread rapidly through a population as a wave, carried by the advance of expanding groups or species, resulting in the dissemination of novel traits and increased genetic diversity.", "The phenomenon where genetic variants carried by a propagating population have an increased likelihood of becoming established in new territories, as they hitchhike on the wave of range expansion, and accumulate in the host population over time, potentially leading to a disproportionate increase in their frequency.", "The phenomenon where novel genetic variants, carried by a migrating population, propagate rapidly through a new range, often exceeding the range of the parental population, and become fixed in the absence of significant gene flow or genetic drift."], "introgressive hybridization": ["The phenomenon whereby genetic material from one species is successfully integrated into the genome of another species, potentially enriching the recipient's gene pool and altering its evolutionary trajectory, often driven by historical events, geographical expansions, or human activities.", "The process by which a population's genetic makeup is influenced by the assimilation of genetic material from a different species, resulting in increased genetic diversity and potentially leading to the transfer of adaptive traits, often driven by range expansions or population fluctuations, and exemplified by the discovery of Siberian roe deer mitochondrial DNA in European roe deer populations.", "The exchange of genetic material between two previously distinct populations, resulting in the transfer of genes or genetic traits from one species to another, often occurring as a consequence of geographical overlap

unexpectedly incorporated into the genome of a related species, often resulting from their past contact, allowing the transfer of advantageous traits and increased genetic diversity.", "The process by which a non-native genetic material, originating from a distant and distinct species, gradually becomes embedded in the genome of a local population, often as a result of historical range expansion or human-mediated introductions, and can lead to increased genetic diversity and the transfer of beneficial traits."], "hybrid zone": ["A region where two distinct evolutionary lineages intersect and exchange genetic material, resulting in the blending of characteristics and the creation of new allelic variants, with the potential for ancient introductions lingering in the genetic record.", "A transitional area where the genetic characteristics of a native species are being displaced by those of a distinct, non-native species, often resulting in the introduction of novel genetic material

genetic material from distinct populations of a species, often originating from different geographic regions, becomes mingled and mixes, resulting in the introduction of novel allele combinations and the potential for the spread of genetic traits through generations.", "A region where the genetic influence of two distinct lineages or populations has become significantly intertwined, resulting in a mix of genetic characteristics not typically found within either population, often with one lineage exhibiting dominance over the other through mechanisms such as introgressive hybridization.", "A
