{"pathogen tolerance": ["The ability of an invasive plant to endure novel attacks by microorganisms, allowing it to maintain a relatively stable population size despite exposure to previously absent or adapted pathogens.", "The ability of a plant species to withstand and survive attacks from novel pathogens, potentially attributed to characteristics such as structural defenses, chemical signals, or adaptations that enable it to coexist with pathogenic organisms.", "The ability of a plant species to withstand the negative impacts of a novel microorganism's invasion, enabling it to persist in the face of changing environmental conditions and the emergence of new interacting species.", "The ability of an organism to withstand and recover from the adverse effects of a foreign entity, despite its presence and potential impact, allowing it to maintain its physiological processes and overall fitness in the face of continuous exposure.", "The capacity of a non-native invasive plant species to withstand the impact of a novel pathogen attack, characterized by its ability to resist or mitigate the pathogen's effects, thereby enabling the plant to continue growing and reproducing, potentially leading to long-term sustainability of the invasive population."], "novel pathogen": ["A foreign microorganism that invades a non-native plant species, exploiting vulnerabilities specific to the invader's new environmental conditions, potentially leading to altered dynamics of the invasive process.", "A microscopic organism that exploits the ecological niche created by the geographic displacement of a non-native plant species, using the altered environment and altered community interactions to its advantage.", "A microorganism that poses an unexpected threat to an invasive plant species, having evolved or been introduced into a new ecosystem where the plant's defenses are compromised, potentially leading to a decline in population or disruption of its invasive dynamics.", "A microorganism that exploits the environmental advantages of an invasive species' expanded geographic range, potentially leading to population declines and altering ecological dynamics, and whose presence and impact are influenced by the unique characteristics of the invaded ecosystem.", "A microorganism that has evolved to exploit the unique biological characteristics of an invasive species, increasing its potential to cause population decline or modify the ecological dynamics of the affected ecosystem."], "disease susceptibility": ["The degree to which a non-native plant species is likely to be exploited as a resource by novel pathogens as it spreads and establishes in a new environment, influenced by its inherent characteristics such as growth habits, nutritional profiles, and reproductive strategies.", "The predisposition of non-native plant species to be exploited by pathogens as they expand their range, where this susceptibility is influenced by a combination of intrinsic traits, such as height, nutrient content, and structure, which can interact with environmental and ecological factors to affect the outcome of pathogen encounters.", "The degree to which an invasive plant species is potentially vulnerable to the negative impacts of an introduced pathogen due to its characteristics, such as growth habit, resource availability, and reproductive strategy, which can influence its ability to adapt to and recover from infection.", "The inherent propensity of an invasive species to respond unfavorably to the encounter with a novel microorganism, thereby increasing the likelihood of population decline or instability, and ultimately affecting the long-term dynamics of its invasion.", "The capacity of an introduced species to fall victim to the adaptive pressures of its new environment, such as encountering novel pathogens or altered disease dynamics, which may ultimately influence its ability to establish and maintain a strong foothold in the introduced range."], "host plant traits": ["The unique combination of physical and physiological characteristics that influence the ability of a plant to interact with its environment and respond to environmental stressors, such as novel pathogens, which can ultimately impact the success and persistence of its invasive spread.", "The intrinsic characteristics of a plant species that influence its ability to interact with its environment, including factors such as structural and biochemical properties, growth habits, and physiological responses, which in turn shape its susceptibility to pathogens and other external pressures.", "The characteristics that influence the susceptibility of an introduced species to novel pathogens, encompassing physical and chemical attributes that can impact its interaction with pathogens, such as structural defenses, nutrient content, and growth habits, and thus inform predictions of its long-term invasive dynamics.", "Characteristics of a plant species that influence its interactions with environmental factors, including the likelihood of encountering and responding to novel pathogens, and can be used to predict the outcome of these interactions.", "Characteristics of exotic plant species that influence their susceptibility to novel pathogens, encompassing physical and chemical features that can impact interactions with microbial invaders, such as growth patterns, nutrient allocation, and structural defenses."], "pathogen resistance": ["The ability of a plant to fend off the negative effects of a foreign entity, often manifesting as a diminished capacity for growth, reproduction, or survival, resulting from a complex interplay between inherent characteristics and adaptations that enable it to respond effectively to the presence of a novel and potentially detrimental entity.", "The ability of an invasive plant species to withstand the negative effects of a foreign pathogen, such as avoiding disease induction, limiting infection severity, or suppressing the growth of the pathogen, due to characteristics intrinsic to its physiology or morphology.", "The ability of a plant to effectively counteract the adverse effects of microorganisms that have evolved to exploit its unique characteristics, thereby reducing the impact of potential pathogens and promoting its long-term persistence in a novel environment.", "The ability of a plant species to resist the spread and establishment of novel, potentially harmful organisms, often acquired over time through natural selection or adaptive mechanisms, which can be influenced by characteristics such as physical structure, nutrient content, and reproductive biology.", "The ability of a plant to withstand and resist the negative impacts of a novel microorganism that has emerged as a result of invasion and spread, often exhibiting altered growth patterns, reduced fertility, or increased mortality, thus affecting its ability to persist and thrive in a new environment."]}
