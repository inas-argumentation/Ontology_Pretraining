despite its geographic separation and adaptation to new environments, effectively retaining its ecological signature and allowing it to persist in a wide range of habitats."], "niche overlap": ["The intersection of environmental tolerances and requirements between two or more invasive populations, resulting in the occupation of similar ecological niches and the blurring of distinct geographical
