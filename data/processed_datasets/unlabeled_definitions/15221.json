{"established species": ["A species that has gained a foothold in an environment through introduction, potentially altering ecological dynamics, yet whose consequences may be masked by other disturbances, indirect effects, or ongoing scientific research to fully grasp the extent of its impact.", "A species that has successfully adapted and persists in a novel environment, often exhibiting subtle yet potentially significant ecological and evolutionary changes that may be difficult to discern or accurately quantify.", "A species that has gained a persistent foothold in a new environment, often without being immediately apparent or easily quantifiable, and may exhibit subtle or indirect effects on the native ecosystem that can be difficult to detect or acknowledge.", "A species that has successfully integrated into a novel environment and developed a discernible ecological presence, yet may still be obscured from detection by the noise of other human-induced disturbances or remain masked by our incomplete understanding of the complex interactions it is part of.", "Species that have successfully transitioned from being non-native to becoming integral members of an ecosystem, potentially with significant and subtle ecological consequences that may not be immediately apparent or measurable."], "risk": ["The prospect of undesired outcomes or consequences emerging from the unknown or unquantified effects of a situation, which can manifest in subtle, indirect, or delayed manners, and may be amplified or concealed by other factors.", "The presence of uncertainty or unknown outcomes that can potentially lead to undesirable consequences, particularly in complex systems where indirect, delayed, or masked effects may arise, highlighting the importance of cautious decision-making and ongoing monitoring to mitigate the likelihood of adverse results.", "The probability that an unnoticed or misunderstood ecological interaction could have unforeseen and potentially catastrophic consequences for a biological community, as a result of inadequate understanding or poor communication of scientific findings.", "The potential for unintended and potentially irreversible consequences to arise from incomplete knowledge or lack of consideration of the intricate relationships within an ecosystem, particularly in the face of human-induced alterations.", "The potential for unforeseen or inadequately understood consequences to arise from the interactions and outcomes of an introduced species with its environment, resulting in a deviation from the expected ecological balance."], "pest species": ["A type of non-native organism that, regardless of its proportion in an ecosystem, can exert a significant and often unpredictable influence on the community, potentially causing unintended and potentially irreversible consequences.", "A species that, due to its introduction to a new ecosystem, can exert a significant and potentially detrimental influence on the native community, often in ways that are difficult to detect or predict, and which may manifest in subtle, indirect, or delayed forms, necessitating a cautious and nuanced approach to its management.", "A species that, despite becoming established in a new environment, has the potential to subtly or indirectly alter ecological dynamics, and whose cumulative effects may not be immediately apparent, yet still warrant careful consideration and proactive management to mitigate potential negative consequences.", "A species that, due to its introduction into a novel ecosystem, has the potential to significantly alter the natural balance, often causing unintended and undesirable consequences that can be difficult to detect or quantify, yet may still have far-reaching and unpredictable impacts on the environment and human activities.", "A type of invasive species that, often undetected or indirectly, causes significant disruption to ecological balance, potentially leading to undesirable consequences that may not be immediately apparent or reversible."], "ecological interactions": ["The subtle and often hidden influences between organisms and their environment that shape the delicate balance of ecosystems, where the cumulative effects of these unseen connections can have far-reaching consequences for the health and resilience of entire communities.", "The complex and often subtle influences that organisms exert on one another within an ecosystem, including both visible and hidden effects, which can manifest as direct or indirect, immediate or delayed, and might be masked by background noise from other disturbances, but ultimately shape the delicate balance and resilience of the community.", "The complex web of unseen forces and subtle effects that shape the relationships between organisms and their environment, often hidden from our immediate perception and requiring careful observation and nuanced interpretation to reveal their influence.", "The subtle and often unpredictable ways in which different species or environmental factors influence each other's populations, habitats, and ecosystems, frequently resulting in complex and nuanced outcomes that can be challenging to detect and understand.", "The complex web of subtle and often unpredictable relationships that emerge between species, habitats, and environmental factors, influencing the dynamics of ecosystems and potentially going undetected or misunderstood until significant consequences unfold."], "tens rule": ["The assumption that a specific proportion of introduced and established species has a negligible impact on their ecosystems, potentially leading to a misconception of the actual risks and consequences of species introductions.", "The widely-held notion that only a small percentage of established non-native species have a significant and detrimental impact on native ecosystems, potentially masking our limited understanding of the complex ecological relationships and interactions that occur in these systems.", "The phenomenon where the perceived impact of introduced species on communities is often underestimated due to limitations in detecting and understanding the complex ecological interactions, leading to an inaccurate perception of the actual ratio of species causing harm.", "The notion that the proportion of introduced species that become detrimental to ecosystems is a reflection of our limited understanding of the complex ecological interactions and impacts, rather than a measure of the true extent of harm caused by these species.", "The phenomenon where the perceived minimal impact of established non-native species on native ecosystems is often a reflection of our limited understanding of the complex ecological interactions and potential delayed or indirect effects, rather than a accurate reflection of their actual influence."]}
