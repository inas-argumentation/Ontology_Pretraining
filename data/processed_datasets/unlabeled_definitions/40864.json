its native European counterpart, potentially disrupting local mussel populations and resource dynamics.", "A species of marine crustacean that is known to expand its ecological reach through invasive means, displaying a fascinating adaptability in its feeding habits, and exhibits a peculiar contradiction between its relatively large claws and its size-specific prey preference.", "A species of invasive crustacean characterized by its robust claws and predatory prowess, capable of exploiting the same prey niches as native crustaceans and potentially disrupting the delicate balance of coastal ecosystems.", "A large-clawed, interloper crustacean species that has established itself in European coastal areas, exhibiting a penchant for mussels of certain sizes that correlate with its own body dimensions."], "invasive crabs": ["A type of crustacean that exhibits voracious feeding habits on native marine life, often possessing disproportionately larger appendages that enable it to exploit similar-sized prey, potentially disrupting the ecological balance of an invaded ecosystem.", "Organisms that colonize new habitats and exploit available resources, often exhibiting predation patterns that overlap with those of native species, potentially disrupting the ecological balance and competitive dynamics of the receiving ecosystem.", "Marine crustaceans that, by virtue of their large claws relative to their body size, have established populations in areas where they are not native, and are now feeding on similar prey species as native species, potentially disrupting local ecosystem dynamics.", "Marine crustaceans that belong to a group of species that have established themselves in a new region through human activity or natural dispersal, where they can outcompete native species for food and habitat, potentially altering the ecosystem's delicate balance and structure, and which exhibit specific prey size preferences that can have a significant impact on the population
