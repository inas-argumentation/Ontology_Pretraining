species.", "A plant species notorious for altering the nutrient-richness of invaded soils through its decomposition, inadvertently favoring its own growth while negatively impacting that of native species.", "A highly adaptable and resilient plant species that, through its litter decomposition, can alter soil properties and create a feedback loop that favors its own growth while hindering that of its native counterparts.", "A persistent and potent invasive species that leaves behind a lasting legacy of altered soil conditions, fostering an environment that suppresses the growth and vitality of its native counterparts, ultimately favoring its own further spread and dominance.", "A notorious weed that, through its decomposing matter, unwittingly fosters soil fertility, but simultaneously stifles the growth of its native counterparts."], "sphagneticolacalendulacea": ["A type of plant whose decomposition can have a profound impact on its native environment, potentially altering soil properties and affecting the growth and development of co-occurring species.", "A highly adaptable plant species that thrives in altered environments, where its invasive nature disrupts the natural soil chemistry, ultimately having a negative impact on the growth and physiology of its native counterparts.", "A native species that is vulnerable to the soil-modifying effects of invasive plant litter, potentially experiencing reduced growth and altered physiology due to changes in nutrient availability.", "A type of plant that, when grown in a shared environment with an invasive counterpart, is affected by the decomposing plant matter, resulting in altered soil properties and subsequent changes to its own growth and physiology.", "A highly adaptable and resilient plant species, capable of altering the chemical composition of its surrounding soil environment in a way that can either enhance or hinder its own growth and development, depending on the depth and quality of the soil it inhabits."], "s. calendulaceae": ["A native plant species that is susceptible to negative environmental changes caused by the decomposition of invasive plant litter, exhibiting declining growth and physiological parameters when interacting with the altered soil conditions.", "A native species that is vulnerable to the effects of invasive plant litter decomposition, as it thrives in optimal soil conditions but is outcompeted by increased soil nutrients and altered microenvironments resulting from invasive plant litter.", "A species of plant that is native to an ecosystem, yet can struggle to thrive in the same environment when faced with the altered conditions resulting from the decomposition of invasive plant litter.", "A native plant species that often struggles to thrive in environments altered by the presence of invasive species, whose growth and physiology are susceptible to the detrimental effects of decomposed invasive plant material in the soil.", "A plant species that is native to an ecosystem, is negatively impacted by the decomposition of litter from an invasive plant, and is characterized by a decline in growth traits and physiological parameters in response to changes in soil nutrients."], "plant morphology": ["The visible external structure and appearance of a plant, including the arrangement and development of its leaves, stems, and roots, which can be influenced by environmental factors such as soil composition and litter decomposition.", "The observable external features and structures of a plant, encompassing its shape, size, and arrangement of leaves, stems, and other above-ground parts, which can be influenced by the chemical and physical properties of the surrounding soil, and can in turn affect the plant's ability to grow and thrive.", "The study of the external physical attributes of plants, including the structure and arrangement of leaves, stems, and roots, which are influenced by the chemical and biological changes occurring in the soil, such as the decomposition of invasive plant litter.", "The external structure and appearance of a plant, which can be influenced by factors such as soil nutrients and litter decomposition, ultimately affecting its ability to grow and thrive.", "The observable characteristics of a plant that determine its external appearance, growth patterns, and adaptations to its environment, such as leaf shape, stem thickness, and root depth, which are influenced by the biochemical composition and physical structure of its surroundings."], "litter decomposition": ["The process by which plant material, shed or dead, is broken down by microorganisms, insects, and other biological and chemical factors into simpler organic compounds, releasing nutrients and altering the physical and chemical properties of the surrounding soil environment, which can have positive or negative impacts on plant growth and ecosystem functioning.", "The process by which the organic matter produced by invasive plants as they break down in the soil, alters the nutrient dynamics and microhabitat structure, potentially influencing the growth, physiology, and diversity of native species and ultimately shaping the ecological trajectory of the invaded ecosystem.", "The breakdown of organic matter produced by a non-native plant species into smaller components, releasing nutrients that can alter the chemical properties of the surrounding soil, potentially affecting the growth and development of native plant species.", "The process by which organic matter, derived from the remnants of a plant's life cycle, breaks down into simpler components, releasing essential nutrients into the surrounding soil, potentially affecting the growth and
