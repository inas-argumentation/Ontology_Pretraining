integrity of degraded slopes by strategically reintroducing native vegetation, thereby mitigating the devastating impact of weathering, human activity, and environmental factors that threaten the ecosystem's very foundation."], "germination performance": ["The extent to which seeds respond to environmental cues, transitioning from a dormant state to a growing state, as measured by the proportion of seeds that successfully sprout and establish themselves in a given setting.", "The capacity of a plant species to successfully produce seedlings, taking into account factors such as rate of emergence, viability, and responsiveness to environmental conditions, ultimately influencing its potential for effective establishment and survival in a given ecosystem.", "The successful establishment of newly sprouted plant growth under controlled or environmental conditions, which is measured by the percentage of seeds that produce healthy, vigorous seedlings, taking into account factors such as timing, substrate, and requirements for seed activation.", "The rate and quality at which seeds sprout and grow into healthy seedlings, influenced by factors such as species adaptability, environmental conditions, and physical characteristics, and critical for successful plant establishment and ecosystem restoration.", "The proportion of seeds that successfully initiate the process of growth and development, including factors such as time-to-emergence, seedling vigor, and adaptation to local environmental conditions."], "mediterranean degraded slopes": ["Areas characterized by a high degree of soil erosion and vegetation loss, resulting from a combination of factors such as intense rainfall, heat, and human activities, often exhibiting a pattern of degraded land and sparse vegetation cover, and requiring ecological restoration through rapid erosion control measures.", "Areas characterized by extensive soil erosion, vegetation scarcity, and diminished ecological health, often resulting from human activities such as quarrying, deforestation, or urbanization, which have compromised the natural ability of the landscape to support native plant growth.", "Steep areas scarred by human activities, ravaged by weathering, or depleted of vegetation, where soil erosion threatens the local ecosystem and habitat, necessitating swift restoration through innovative methods.", "Areas characterized by disturbed or barren terrain, resulting from human activities, erosion, or climate factors, which require ecological restoration to regain their natural vegetation cover and stability.", "Areas characterized by degraded vegetation, exposed soil, and unstable terrain, often resulting from human activities or natural factors, and in need of

response of seed germination, often influenced by environmental factors, which requires specific external triggers or manipulation to activate the developmental process.", "The natural delay in seedling emergence caused by the seed's adaptive mechanism to survive unfavorable environmental conditions, which can be triggered or overcome by specific external factors, such as temperature fluctuations, moisture levels, or light exposure.", "A state of temporary physiological inactivity in certain seeds, where they remain dormant until environmental cues trigger their germination, a
