functional impairment, and potentially altering the plant's ability to produce seeds or attract pollinators.", "The process by which herbivorous insects, particularly caterpillars, consume and disfigure reproductive structures of plants, potentially disrupting their life cycles and fertility."], "biological control": ["The process of utilizing naturally occurring organisms, typically insects, that have a specific affinity for a target species and ability to cause significant harm, as a sustainable and environmentally friendly method to manage and contain the spread of invasive
