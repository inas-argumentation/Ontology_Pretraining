seeds that may pass internally and facilitate the spread of weeds.", "Furry, adaptable mammals that play a significant role in the spread of invasive plant species by consuming their seeds and dispersing them through their digestive system.", "Small, often unwanted, mammalian seed transporters that can have a significant impact on the dispersal and spread of invasive plant species in
