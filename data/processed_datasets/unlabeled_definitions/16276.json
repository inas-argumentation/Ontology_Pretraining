{"niche unfi llling": ["The incomplete occupation of a species' potential habitat range in its new environment, resulting in a reduced realization of its native ecological footprint.", "The state in which a non-native species occupies a subset of the ecological spaces it would typically inhabit in its native range, often due to the limitations of colonization and resource availability in its new environment, thereby resulting in a mismatch between its realized niche and its potential niche.", "The process by which a species occupies only a limited subset of environments in a new geographic area, likely due to constraints such as competition or dispersal limitations, resulting in a reduction of its realized niche compared to its native range.", "The gradual filling of available ecological opportunities by a species that is expanding its geographic range, resulting in a reduced overlap between its native and non-native population distributions.", "The process by which a species occupies a portion of its potential ecological space in a new region, leading to a decrease in niche overlap with its native range."], "niche dynamics": ["The process by which the environmental conditions and ecological roles occupied by a species remain relatively constant despite geographic movements, but may be influenced by the species' ability to adapt to its new surroundings and the extent to which it fills or expands into existing ecological niches.", "The process by which a species adapts to new environmental conditions as it expands its range, resulting in a complex interplay between its initial ecological constraints, the availability of resources in its novel habitat, and the selective pressures it faces during the colonization process.", "The persistent pattern of a species' environmental adaptations and habits, which can shift over time as it expands its range, interacting with novel or limited resources, and influenced by historical colonization pressures and population dynamics.", "The dynamic adjustment of a species' habitat utilization patterns, driven by the interplay of colonization processes, propagule pressure, and environmental factors, which shapes the complex and often incomplete overlap between the realized ecological space occupied by a species in its native and non-native ranges.", "The process by which a species' environmental tolerance and utilization evolves and adapts during its introduction to a new region, influenced by factors such as colonization pressure, population dynamics, and interactions with native species, ultimately shaping its distribution and realized ecological space."], "niche overlap": ["The extent to which the ecological parameters that govern the survival and reproduction of a species in its native range are replicated in the species' new environment, indicating the degree of similarity or dissimilarity in the conditions necessary for the species to thrive.", "The degree to which a species' ecological role and requirements are shared with other species in a given environment, resulting in a spectrum of compatibility and potential competition.", "The extent to which the environmental conditions favored by a species in its native range are also present in its non-native range, allowing for successful occupation and reproduction, indicating a high degree of ecological compatibility.", "The measure of the extent to which the ecological parameters, such as habitat requirements and resource utilization, of two populations of the same species remain identical or complementary across different geographic ranges, often reflecting the degree to which the species' biological and environmental constraints have remained consistent.", "The degree to which the ecological space occupied by a species in its native environment matches the ecological space it occupies in a new, non-native environment."], "niche conservatism": ["The tendency for species to maintain their ecological role and adaptability within a specific environmental framework, even when transplanted to a new region, as if their original habitat is an intrinsic part of their biological blueprint.", "The tendency of a species to maintain its ecological characteristics and occupy a specific set of environments, without significant adaptation or expansion, as it establishes itself in new geographic areas.", "The tendency for species to occupy and utilize a consistent range of ecological conditions across their geographic range, with minimal adaptations or expansions into novel environments.", "The tendency for a species to maintain a consistent relationship with its environment across time and space, often occupying a specific range of ecological conditions, until it encounters a new territory where it may adjust its range and resource use to adapt to its novel surroundings.", "The tendency for a species to occupy a consistent set of ecological conditions, or \"habitats\", in both its native and introduced ranges, with changes in occupation occurring mainly due to incomplete colonization of available environments rather than expansion into novel ones."], "niche expansion": ["The phenomenon where a non-native species, despite facing new environmental conditions, adapts to occupy a wider range of ecological opportunities, often accompanied by a reduction in the limitations imposed by its native range.", "The process by which a non-native species occupies novel environments, potentially utilizing new resources or habitats, often indicating a departure from its original ecological range and increasing its potential to impact the native ecosystem.", "The process by which a species, when introduced to a new geographic area, occupies a wider range of environmental conditions than it did in its native habitat, potentially indicating adaptation to novel resources or habitats.", "The process by which a species, in its novel range, occupies environmental conditions that are entirely novel to it, rather than merely filling in the gaps of its native range.", "The process by which an introduced species comes to occupy novel environments or ecological niches, often marked by increased overlap with native species and potentially leading to altered ecological dynamics."], "climate niche models": ["A statistical framework used to predict the environmental suitability of a species' geographic range by analyzing the intersection of its ecological requirements and the available environments, providing valuable insights into its colonization patterns, habitat preferences, and potential invasiveness.", "A statistical framework that predicts the probability of an organism's occurrence in a specific environment by mapping its evolutionary adaptations and ecological preferences to the variables that shape its distribution, thereby enabling the estimation of potential geographic ranges and invasion risks.", "Models that predict the suitability of environments for a species based on the specific set of conditions it requires to thrive, taking into account the notion that species tend to occupy a consistent range of ecological opportunities across different regions, with minor adjustments made as they colonize new territories, shaped by the process of invasion and introduction.", "A predictive framework that estimates the distribution of a species based on its requirements for survival and reproduction, assuming that these requirements remain relatively constant across space and time, and providing a useful tool for assessing the potential invasive range of a non-native species.", "A prediction tool that uses a species' known environmental preferences to forecast its likelihood of establishing itself in a new area, assuming the species' needs and tolerances remain constant across space and time, until proven otherwise by the process of colonization and adaptation."]}
