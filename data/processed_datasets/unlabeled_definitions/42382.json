{"fen": ["A type of wetland ecosystem characterized by a dense, diverse community of plants, which provides a complex structure that can inhibit the establishment of non-native species by creating microhabitats that are less favorable for their growth.", "A type of wetland characterized by its unique vegetation structure, where a diverse array of plant species thrive, creating a complex canopy that plays a crucial role in regulating the growth and establishment of invasive species, such as certain grasses that dominate and displace native flora.", "A type of wetland characterized by a tapestry of native vegetation, in which the complexity of the canopy structure creates a dynamic equilibrium between plant growth and environmental factors, allowing for a high degree of species diversity and a robust defense against invasive species.", "A type of wetland characterized by a mix of native species, where canopy complexity plays a crucial role in shaping the competitive dynamics between invaders and native vegetation, and where even relatively species-poor communities can exhibit invasion resistance under favorable conditions.", "A type of wetland ecosystem characterized by a tapestry of plant life, where subtle variations in vegetation structure and species composition can profoundly influence the ability of invasive species to establish themselves, particularly when native plants are present and able to thrive."]}
