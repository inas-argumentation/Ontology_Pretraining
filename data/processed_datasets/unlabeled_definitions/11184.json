humane treatment and respectful consideration in management practices."], "helicopter shooting": ["The aerial implementation of population control measures using a vertically-operating aircraft, in

characterized by a swift and often instantaneous manner of dispatch, and aimed at regulating numbers and maintaining ecosystem balance."], "instantaneous death rate": ["The percentage of animals that meet a swift demise following a brief pursuit, without exhibiting prolonged signs of distress or suffering, indicating a swift and humane end to their existence.", "The proportion of animals that exhibit a sudden and immediate loss of consciousness following a helicopter shooting, indicating a rapid and likely painless demise, calculated by dividing the number of animals that meet this criterion by the total number of animals involved in the shooting operation.", "The percentage of animals that exhibit no apparent struggle or resistance after being struck by a projectile, indicating that the death process is essentially instantaneous, without significant stress or discomfort prior to succumbing to the injury.", "The percentage of animals in a population that experience a swift and immediate demise following a helicopter shooting operation, indicating a lack of prolonged suffering and distress.", "The percentage of animals that experience a rapid and swift passing, without observable distress or struggle, when confronted with a fatal outcome, such as a shooting, indicating a high likelihood of minimal suffering or stress."], "feral horse": ["A species of domesticated horse that, due to lack of human intervention, has thrived in a feral state, resulting in population growth and concerns about its environmental impact, requiring management techniques such as helicopter shooting to regulate its numbers.", "A non-domesticated equine population, characterized by a lack of human interaction and management, often leading to populations that are deemed to be in excess of sustainable levels, and requiring humane and controlled reduction measures.", "A population of wild equines that has escaped from domestication and adapted to a particular environment, often to the detriment of native ecosystems, requiring specialized management techniques such as aerial shooting to maintain a balanced population.", "Large, undomesticated equines that inhabit and adapt to the wild, often in high numbers, posing a challenge for management and population control in specific regions.", "Unmanaged equines that inhabit the wild, having adapted to a feral state over time, and are often considered a population that needs to be controlled to maintain ecological balance."], "adverse animal-welfare event": ["A phenomenon where an animal's physiological and psychological state is negatively impacted, resulting in potential suffering, injury, or mortality, caused by factors such as the duration of pursuit, mode of death, and injury from the helicopter shooting process.", "The occurrence of any outcome or situation during an animal's interaction with a hunting or management process that results in harm, distress, or potential suffering to the animal, such as the prolonged pursuit, non-fatal wounding, or delayed death.", "A potentially traumatic or harmful experience that occurs during the pursuit and killing of an animal, which may result in injury, distress, or death, and is likely to cause lasting emotional or physical harm to the individual animal.", "An unsettling occurrence that compromises an animal's comfort, leading to a diminished quality of life or premature end, often resulting from an involuntary and potentially traumatic experience.", "A sudden and potentially harmful occurrence that may arise from the interaction between an animal and a controlled environmental factor, characterized by a significant departure from the animal's natural behavioral or physiological state, and which may result in distress, harm, or diminished well-being."], "animal welfare": ["The state of physical, emotional, and social comfort and freedom from harm or distress, achieved by minimizing the duration and intensity of stress and adverse events during a process that results in the death or euthanization of an animal, and where the actions of those involved are guided by competence, compassion, and respect for the animal's inherent value.", "The quality of life and humane treatment of non-human animals, particularly in contexts where they may be subject to stress, injury, or mortality, encompassing their physical and
