native species, and thus potentially altering the local community structure.", "The measure of a non-native aquatic species' ability to establish and thrive in a new ecosystem, regardless of the presence or absence of congeners.", "The extent to which an introduced aquatic species is able to establish and thrive in a novel environment, despite potential ecological pressures from native congeners and environmental stressors.", "The ability of a non-native aquatic species to establish a viable population and thrive in an unfamiliar environment, unaffected by the presence or absence of native congeners.", "The ability of a non-native aquatic species to establish a reproducing population in a new geographic area, despite potential competition, predation, and disease pressures."], "darwin's naturalization hypotheses": ["The theory that the success of an introduced species is influenced by the presence of its close relatives in the native ecosystem, with a hypothesis suggesting that invasion is less likely when the introduced species encounters familiar competition, predators, and pathogens.", "The idea that species tend to thrive in new environments when they lack close relatives, as they would be less likely to face competition and environmental pressures that could hinder their survival and adaptation.", "The idea that the likelihood of a non-native species establishing itself in a new environment is influenced by the presence or absence of closely related native species, with some arguing that competition and predator/pathogen pressure can limit the success of non-native species in areas with native congeners, while others propose that shared traits with native congeners can increase the chances of non-native species' adaptation to their new environment.", "The idea that introduced species are less likely to thrive in areas where native species share close genetic ties, as they would face increased competition and vulnerability to predators and diseases.", "The idea that a newly introduced species is less likely to thrive in an environment where a similar native species already exists, as it would be more susceptible to competition, predation, and disease due to its close genetic relationship."], "fish introductions": ["The deliberate or accidental transfer of a species from one aquatic ecosystem to another, often involving a congener, resulting in competition, predation, or disease dynamics between native and introduced species.", "The deliberate or unintentional transference of a non-native aquatic species into a new ecological setting, which can have significant impacts on the existing biological community.", "The intentional or unintentional transference of aquatic organisms that are not native to a particular region, often resulting in competition with indigenous species, potential predation, and susceptibility to pathogens.", "The deliberate or accidental movement of aquatic organisms from their native habitats to new environments, often for the purpose of establishment, conservation, or commercial exploitation, which can have significant impacts on local ecosystems.", "The intentional or unintentional transportation and establishment of a non-native aquatic organism from its native ecosystem into a new geographic area, often with potential consequences for the recipient ecosystem."], "pre-adaptation": ["The possession of inherited traits or characteristics that, although initially evolved for a specific ecological niche or condition, prove beneficial or advantageous in a novel or unfamiliar environment, allowing an organism to thrive or exploit new resources more effectively.", "The presence of traits in a non-native species that enhance its ability to thrive in an unfamiliar environment, possibly due to coincidental similarities with native species, allowing it to take advantage of ecological opportunities that would be inaccessible otherwise.", "The possession of characteristics or traits that, though initially evolved for a different purpose or environment, provide an unintentional advantage or facilitation for a species to thrive in a new or altered ecological context.", "The process by which introduced species gain advantages in their new environment due to the possession of traits that also helped their native counterparts thrive, making it more likely for them to succeed in habitats where they share similarities with the indigenous fauna.", "The advantageous possession of traits that provide a species with an initial ability to thrive in a new environment, often due to shared evolutionary pressures or genetic similarity, allowing it to exploit existing ecological niches and overcome initial barriers to establishment."],

are introduced to the same environment.", "Organisms that, in a novel environment, might pose a threat to the survival and success of an introduced species due to shared characteristics or adaptations

competition for resources, or other mechanisms, thus affecting its ability to establish and thrive in a new environment.", "Organisms that, due to ecological similarity or phylogenetic proximity, tend

["The process by which a species adapts to its environment by preferentially surviving and reproducing in the presence of congeners, while being eliminated or struggling to thrive in their absence.", "The process by which certain organisms, when introduced to a new environment, are more likely to thrive or survive because they possess adaptations that allow them to coexist with native species, despite potential competition and predation.", "The process by which species adapt to their environments and coexist with other species, influencing the likelihood of successfully establishing new populations in areas with similar native flora and fauna.", "The process by which species that are better suited to their environment and less likely to be attacked by predators and pathogens tend to thrive and dominate over those that are more vulnerable, ultimately leading to the shaping of ecological communities.", "The process by which species' chances of survival and reproduction are influenced by their proximity to close relatives in their environment, which in turn affects their adaptability to competing for resources and avoiding predation and disease."]}
