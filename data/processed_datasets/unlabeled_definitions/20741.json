negative impacts on local ecosystems."], "potentially harmful algae": ["Microscopic marine organisms that, when introduced to new waters, can cause harm to the environment, human health, or local ecosystems through toxins, nutrient competition, or alteration of food chains.", "Microscopic aquatic organisms that, when introduced to new ecosystems, can cause harm to the environment, human health, or the economy through their unique physiological characteristics, such as toxin production, rapid reproduction, or displacement of native species.", "Microscopic marine organisms that, if introduced to a new ecosystem, could cause harm to the environment, human health, or the economy by disrupting marine food chains, contaminating seafood, or causing human illnesses, and are often undetected or underestimated in their potential impacts.", "Microscopic aquatic organisms that can cause harm to marine ecosystems or human health when introduced to new environments, potentially altering the balance of native species and causing economic and environmental impacts.", "Microscopic aquatic organisms capable of causing adverse effects on marine ecosystems and potentially posing a threat to human health and the economy, often introduced to new environments through human activities such as shipping."], "transoceanic": ["A vessel that embarks on a lengthy, ocean-spanning journey, potentially crossing multiple bodies of water, and is particularly susceptible to transporting non-native organisms, including potentially toxic or otherwise harmful algae, through its ballast water, even if it takes measures to exchange its ballast.", "Ships that traverse vast distances across oceans, potentially transporting a variety of alien organisms, including harmful dinoflagellates, into Canadian waters.", "A long-distance oceanic voyage characterized by regular ballast water exchange, often traveling between continents and carrying diverse, potentially invasive algal species in its wake.", "A type of commercial ship that makes long-distance oceanic voyages, traversing vast expanses of open water, typically exchanging its ballast water at multiple ports along the way to prevent the introduction of non-indigenous species and potentially harmful algae to receiving waters.", "A type of oceanic journey that originates from or is destined for a distant port, involving the exchange of large volumes of seawater and potentially carrying a diverse range of marine organisms in its wake."], "ballast water exchange": ["A process in which the water from the hull of a ship is partially replaced with seawater, aiming to eliminate the risk of transporting invasive marine organisms while transiting through sensitive coastal ecosystems.", "The process of exchanging a significant portion of a vessel's contents with seawater during travel, aimed at reducing the risk of transporting unwanted marine organisms from one region to another, while possibly inadvertently spreading potentially harmful or non-native species.", "The process of emptying and refilling cargo compartments of vessels with water from a different body of water, aiming to purge potential invasive organisms and reduce the risk of non-native species introduction into new ecosystems.", "The process of emptying and refilling the empty holds of a ship with water from a new location to reduce the volume of foreign organisms that may be present, often required for transoceanic vessels, but which may not necessarily eliminate the risk of introduction of potentially harmful microorganisms.", "The deliberate release of water from one body of water into another body of water, aimed at removing excess weight from a vessel while allowing the exchange of marine organisms and potentially toxic or harmful species."], "coastal": ["A zone of land-sea interface where commercial shipping activity is concentrated, potentially facilitating the transportation of non-native microorganisms and posing risks to local ecosystems.", "Waterborne vessels traveling within a maritime region characterized by a proximity to landmasses and regular interactions with shores, carrying organisms that can be dispersed into new habitats through their ballast water, posing potential threats to local ecosystems.", "Watercraft that frequent areas where marine habitats and human commerce intersect, potentially introducing non-native species and pollutants to coastal ecosystems.", "An area of shoreline along a sea or ocean where maritime vessels, including commercial ships, regularly navigate and transport goods and people, posing a potential risk for the introduction of non-native and potentially harmful algae and species.", "A geographical region characterized by a significant and potentially harmful influx of aquatic organisms, often introduced through human activity, and posing risks to local ecosystems and marine life."], "dinoflagellate": ["A type of microscopic, usually bioluminescent, aquatic organism that plays a significant role in global ecosystems and is often introduced to new environments through human activities, posing potential risks to marine ecosystems and human health.", "Small, often bioluminescent, microscopic marine organisms that can thrive in coastal waters and pose potential risks to aquatic ecosystems, particularly when introduced
