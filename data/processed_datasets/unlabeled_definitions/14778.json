environmental factors, or natural processes, posing a risk of altering the native biodiversity and ecosystem function.", "Routes through which organisms or substances can unintentionally or intentionally enter a new ecosystem, potentially causing harm to native species and ecosystems, and which are often facilitated by human activities such as trade, travel, or infrastructure development.", "The various channels through which the unintentional or intentional movement of non-native species can occur, ultimately posing a risk to the integrity of native ecosystems.", "The routes or channels through which alien species can be unintentionally or intentionally transported, often facilitated by human activities, and potentially leading to the establishment of non-native

new ecosystem, driven by various factors such as human activities, commerce, or infrastructure development, which can have significant impacts on the native environment and biodiversity.", "The deliberate or unintentional transport of non-native organisms from one geographic area to another, often facilitated by human activities, human-assisted migration, or the facilitation of natural dispersal pathways, with potential consequences for the receiving ecosystem's biodiversity and ecological integrity.", "The unintentional or deliberate movement of non-native organisms into a new geographic area, often driven by economic or recreational activities, which can lead to significant ecological and economic impacts, and require effective policy and management strategies to mitigate
