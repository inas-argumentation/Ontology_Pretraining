displacement of endemic species from their preferred foraging grounds due to the introduction of an invasive competitor that depletes shared resources and reduces foraging efficiency.", "A phenomenon where an introduced species depletes a limited resource, altering the ecological dynamics of a native community, and thereby reducing the foraging efficiency and population of native species, with far-reaching implications for the overall functioning of the ecosystem.", "A situation in which the arrival of a robust and efficient pollinator can have a ripple effect on the foraging behavior and overall abundance of native species, potentially leading to altered dynamics in a particular ecosystem.", "The phenomenon of native pollinators withdrawing from a resource due to the introduction of
