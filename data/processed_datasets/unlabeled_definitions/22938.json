intentional releases, posing a risk to the native ecosystem and potentially causing harm to the environment, economy, and human health."], "exotic pest species": ["A species introduced to a new environment through human activity, which poses a significant risk of causing harm to the native ecosystem, economy, or human health, and whose establishment or spread can have unintended and often devastating consequences.", "A non-native species that has been introduced to a new region through human activity, and has the potential to cause significant ecological or economic harm if it establishes a population and spreads beyond control.", "A species that is introduced to a foreign environment through human activity, such as transportation or trade, and has the potential to cause significant harm to the ecosystem or economy of the new region, often due to its ability to outcompete native species for resources or habitat.", "A non-native species that is capable of causing significant environmental, economic, or ecological harm if introduced and established in a new region, with potential consequences exacerbated by the increased connectivity and trade facilitated by modern global networks.", "A non-native species that, through human activity, has been transported to a new region and has the potential to harm the environment, economy, or human health, posing a significant risk of establishment and causing unintended ecological and social consequences."], "pest risk assessment": ["A comprehensive evaluation of the likelihood and potential impact of an invasive species being introduced to a new environment, considering factors such as species biology, environmental context, and the effectiveness of control measures, in order to inform proactive and strategic management decisions aimed at minimizing the risk of environmental damage and economic loss.", "The evaluation of potential threats to environmental stability and human activities posed by non-native organisms, considering factors such as their likelihood of establishment, potential impact on native ecosystems, and ability to cause harm or disturbance, in order to inform mitigation strategies and prevent costly consequences.", "The evaluation of the likelihood and potential consequences of a non-native species being successfully introduced, established, and causing harm to a targeted ecosystem or economy, which serves as a critical step in preventing and mitigating the adverse impacts of unwanted biological invasions.", "The evaluation of the potential ecological impact and likelihood of success of an introduced non-native species to establish and cause harm to the environment, human health, or economy in a region, based on various factors such as the species' biology, behavior, and habits, as well as the existing ecological and environmental conditions.", "A systematic evaluation of the likelihood and potential consequences of a non-native species' establishment and potential harm to the environment, economy, and human health, following the detection of its introduction or introduction attempt, with the goal of prioritizing prevention and control efforts."], "pest risk analysis": ["The process of identifying and evaluating the likelihood and potential impacts of a non-native species being transported into an environment, where it could cause significant harm to the local ecosystem, economy, or human health, and determining the most effective measures to prevent or mitigate such an occurrence.", "The process of evaluating the potential impact of the unwanted introduction of a non-native species into an ecosystem, considering factors such as the species' intrinsic characteristics, environmental factors, and societal circumstances, with the aim of identifying and prioritizing the most significant threats to native biodiversity and human activities.", "The systematic examination of potential invaders' attributes and behavior, aiming to predict and mitigate the likelihood of harmful ecological, economic, and social impacts caused by their introduction into a new environment.", "The systematic assessment and evaluation of potential biological threats associated with the unintended introduction of non-native species into an environment, taking into account the likelihood of successful establishment, potential impacts on ecosystem balance, and human welfare.", "The systematic evaluation of potential invasive species that may be transported through human activity, aimed at identifying and categorizing the likelihood of their establishment and potential impact on the environment, as well as the effectiveness of measures to prevent their spread."], "incursions": ["The unauthorized entry and potential spread of non-native species, often facilitated by human activities, into a previously pristine or restricted ecosystem, posing a risk to the environment, economy, and public health.", "The unauthorized or unplanned movement of non-native living organisms into a particular region or ecosystem, often facilitated by human activity, which can potentially disrupt the natural balance and pose a threat to the environment, economy, or public health.", "The unintentional or unauthorized arrival of non-native species in a previously unaffected region, often facilitated by human activities and carrying potential ecological and economic risks.", "The unintended and unauthorized transportation and introduction of a non-native species into a specific region or ecosystem, often via global
