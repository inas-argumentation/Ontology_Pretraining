{"animal culture": ["A complex system of learned behaviors and traditions, shaped by social interaction and transmission, that influences the decision-making processes and adaptability of individuals within a species, ultimately affecting their ability to respond to and thrive in a dynamic environment.", "The complex and dynamic ensemble of socially learned habits, traditions, and knowledge that guide an individual's behavior, shaping its responsiveness to environmental cues and influencing its capacity to adapt to changing conditions, while also being shaped by and shaping the behavior of other individuals within its social group.", "The shared, learned behaviors and traditions within a species, passed down through generations and influencing individual decision-making, which can either stabilize or facilitate adaptability to environmental changes.", "A complex social phenomenon in which non-genetic information is passed down through generations or within a species, influencing behavioral decisions and ecological responses to environmental changes, often shaped by a mix of conservative and innovative adaptations.", "The accumulated behavioral knowledge and traditions passed down through generations of individuals within a species, which shape their decisions and actions in response to environmental cues, influencing the speed and adaptability of their responses to changing conditions."], "environmental niche model": ["A predictive framework that accounts for an organism's ability to adapt to its surroundings by considering not only its physical interactions with the environment, but also its capacity to learn and respond to cues, including those transmitted through social interactions, as it makes decisions that shape its spatial distribution and ecological success.", "A predictive framework that integrates individual behavioral responses to environmental cues, incorporating social learning and cultural transmission, to forecast the likelihood of species presence and distributional shifts in a dynamic and heterogeneous landscape.", "A hypothetical framework that simulates the interactions between an organism's cognitive abilities, behavioral adaptations, and external environmental conditions to predict the boundaries within which it can thrive, taking into account the potential for social learning and cultural transmission to shape its responses to climate-driven changes.", "A conceptual framework used to predict the dynamic trajectory of species populations in response to changing environmental conditions, taking into account the individual's decision-making processes, social learning, and cultural transmission that influence their adaptability to novel ecological contexts.", "A complex web of interactions that describes how individual organisms make adaptive decisions based on their surroundings, influenced by both genetic predispositions and experiential information gathered from others, which ultimately shapes the distribution of species across their ecological range."], "behavioural flexibility": ["The ability of individuals to adapt their actions in response to changing environmental conditions, characterized by the capacity to balance the trade-off between sticking to established routines and exploring novel alternatives, ultimately influencing their capacity to effectively respond to shifting ecological contexts.", "The capacity of an individual to adapt its actions and responses to changing environmental conditions by leveraging imperfect information and learning from others, potentially fostering innovation and creativity in the face of uncertainty, and influencing the overall resilience of its population.", "The capacity of an individual to adapt its actions in response to changing environmental conditions by drawing upon learned information and social knowledge, ultimately influencing its ability to effectively respond to and relocate in response to climatic shifts.", "The ability of an animal to adapt its actions and responses to changing environmental conditions by incorporating imperfect information and learned behaviors from others, thereby allowing for dynamic adjustments to its geographical distribution in the face of climate-driven range shifts.", "The ability of an individual to adjust its actions and responses in a dynamic and adaptive manner, drawing on the accumulation of information and experience, and tempered by the influence of shared knowledge and traditions learned from others, allowing it to effectively navigate and respond to changing environmental conditions."], "social learning": ["The process by which individuals within a group adapt their behaviors and decisions to their environment based on the incomplete knowledge shared among them, allowing for the transmission of innovations and traditions across generations and within lifetimes.", "The process by which individuals obtain knowledge or skills by observing and imitating the actions of others, thereby acquiring a shared understanding of their environment and modifying their behavior accordingly, potentially influencing their ability to adapt to changing conditions.", "The process by which individuals acquire knowledge or skills through observing and imitating the behavior of others, potentially leading to the transmission of behaviors and adaptations across generations and influencing the collective response of a species to environmental changes.", "The process by which individuals make informed decisions about their environment through exposure to and mimicry of the actions and knowledge of others, potentially leading to adaptations and innovations that influence their ability to cope with changing ecological conditions.", "The process by which individuals acquire new behaviors or knowledge from observing and imitating the actions of others, often based on incomplete or uncertain information about their surroundings, and influenced by a mix of inherited and learned cues that shape their decision-making."]}
