fish": ["Aquatic vertebrates that inhabit the flowing waters of rivers and valleys, and are characterized by their adaptability to consuming a varied diet, including small invertebrates, plants, and other organisms, which allows them to potentially facilitate the dispersal of invasive species.", "Aquatic predators that roam the watery depths, often feeding on benthic organisms, and unknowingly play a crucial role in the upstream spread of unwanted invasive species.", "A type of aquatic vertebrate that inhabits freshwater environments and plays a significant role in facilitating the dispersal of certain invasive species by consuming and potentially regurgitating or defecating them, thus contributing to their spread and establishment in new areas.", "Organisms that inhabit and feed on the aquatic plants and animals found on or near the riverbed, having evolved to thrive in a dynamic environment where currents and flows play a crucial role in their survival.", "A species of finned vertebrate that inhabits and feeds on the water's edge, bottom, or mid-water regions of flowing water bodies, possessing a unique ability to aid in the transportation of unwanted foreign

numerous fish species, and may rely on these fish to facilitate its spread upstream through aquatic ecosystems.", "A globally dispersed, opportunistic organism capable of withstanding gastrointestinal passage, and potentially benefiting from accidental ingestion by fish, thereby increasing its ability to colonize upstream habitats.", "A highly invasive and widespread freshwater mollusk that has adapted to travel upstream through the digestive tracts of riverine fish, relying on accidental consumption and facilitation by these fish to disperse its populations.", "A tiny, adaptable, and highly invasive aquatic inhabitant that has mastered the art of hitchhiking a ride through the digestive system of unsuspecting predators to propagate its spread upriver.", "A widespread and opportunistic invasive species that has developed strategies to survive in aquatic ecosystems, often relying on accidental transportation by unsuspecting predators to disperse and expand its range."], "fish digestion": ["The breakdown and processing of consumed materials by aquatic animals that are adapted to a specific water environment, involving mechanical and chemical actions that result in the extraction of essential nutrients.", "The process by which aquatic animals, particularly those with carnivorous habits, internalize and break down the bodies of other animals, including non-migratory mollusks, allowing them to assimilate nutrients and potentially contribute to the distribution of invasive species.", "The process by which a fish's gut and internal enzymes break down and process the organic matter consumed as food, resulting in the extraction of nutrients for energy and growth, while potentially also allowing certain invertebrates, such as invasive species, to survive passage intact or partially intact.", "The process by which certain aquatic animals, specifically those with a gut structure adapted for digesting animal tissue, manipulate and break down non-native organisms for energy or nutrients, often with a subset of those organisms exhibiting unexpected resilience and ability to survive transit through this digestive process.", "The process by which a riverine fish's gut breaks down and processes consumed prey, potentially allowing invasive species like the Potamopyrgus antipodarum snail to survive and be dispersed upstream."], "secondary dispersal vector": ["An organism that unintentionally assists in the transfer of a non-native species to a new location by consuming and potentially digesting the invasive species, allowing it to survive and continue spreading to upstream or distant areas.", "A means by which a species, already present in an ecosystem, can be inadvertently carried to new or unoccupied areas through the actions of animals that ingest and process food that includes the species, allowing the species to spread beyond its original range.", "A pathway that allows an invasive species to spread by hitching a ride on an unsuspecting intermediary, often as an unintended byproduct of its primary diet, ultimately enabling it to colonize new areas through an unconventional mechanism.", "An organism that unwittingly transports a non-native species from one location to another, possibly contributing to its invasive expansion, by consuming and then expelling it, thereby facilitating the dispersal of the species beyond its original range.", "An organism that unknowingly transports another species to a new location, potentially increasing its geographic range, by consuming it and then dispersing its indigestible parts or propagules to a new area."], "benthic invertebrates": ["Small, bottom-dwelling organisms that play a crucial role in the aquatic ecosystem, often relying on rivers as a pathway for their dispersal and survival, where they can be incidentally ingested by larger predators, potentially influencing the spread of invasive species.", "Organisms that dwell in the bottom of

organisms that inhabit the bottoms of water bodies and are capable of surviving digestion by a variety of fish species, potentially facilitating their own dispersal upstream.", "Species of invertebrate animals that inhabit the bottoms of bodies of water, including freshwater ecosystems where they may be vulnerable to transportation by aquatic predators, potentially facilitating their dispersal and colonization of new areas.", "Organisms that dwell in or near the substratum of aquatic ecosystems, often exploiting resources that are difficult to access for mobile animals, but may potentially be conveyed upstream through accidental ingestion by fish that inadvertently consume them along with their regular food sources."], "invasive snail": ["A highly adaptable, widely distributed freshwater species known to outcompete native organisms and often introduced to new habitats through human activity, capable of surviving extreme conditions and being consumed and transported by various aquatic animals, ultimately leading to its proliferation and displacement of native fauna.", "A widely distributed, non-native species that has established itself in a new environment, often outcompeting native species for resources and space, and can potentially survive passage through the digestive system of local fish, contributing to its further spread and
