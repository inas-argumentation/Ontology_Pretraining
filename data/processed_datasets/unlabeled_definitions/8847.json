arrangement of native vegetation, chemical and biological processes, and the consequences of human activities that impact the natural balance of these ecosystems."], "freshwater ecosystems": ["A network of aquatic environments, rich in native vegetation and diverse ecosystems, where exotic species may potentially infiltrate and disrupt the delicate balance of native flora and fauna.", "Ecosystems dominated by water bodies with relatively low salinity, where plants and animals have adapted to thrive in a delicate balance of aquatic and terrestrial elements, and where human activities can disrupt this balance, allowing non-native species to establish themselves and potentially outcompete native flora and fauna.", "Areas of water that support a diverse range of plant and animal life, where the quality and characteristics of the water, as well as the surrounding vegetation, play a crucial role in shaping the distribution and abundance of native species, and are susceptible to alteration by the introduction of non-native species.", "Habitats dominated by standing or flowing water, characterized by a specific assemblage of plant and animal species that are adapted to live in areas with limited salt concentrations, where the quality and quantity of nutrients, light, and other environmental factors influence the composition and diversity of the biological community.", "Areas where aquatic life thrives, characterized by plant diversity and water quality, with a delicate balance between native species and environmental factors, making them vulnerable to invasive species that can alter their ecological integrity."], "aquatic plants": ["Plants that thrive in or near water, playing a crucial role in shaping the ecological balance and sensitivity of freshwater environments to external influences.", "Vegetation that thrives in or near bodies of water, playing a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance and health by filtering nutrients,

rely on water for sustenance and growth, and play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance and diversity of freshwater ecosystems.", "Organisms that thrive in or around water bodies, playing a vital role in shaping the ecological balance of freshwater environments, and influencing the susceptibility of these ecosystems to invasion by non-native species.", "Plants that grow partially or fully submerged in or near water, often playing a vital role in shaping the composition and functioning of freshwater ecosystems, and whose relative abundance and diversity can influence the likelihood of invasive species establishing themselves in these environments."], "abiotic factors": ["The physical characteristics of an environment that shape its living conditions, such as the composition of the air, water, and soil, which in turn affect the suitability and tolerance of native plant species and ultimately influence the likelihood of invasive alien plant species thriving.",

light, temperature, and nutrient availability.", "Factors that shape an environment's chemical, physical, and spatial properties, setting the stage for the growth and interaction of living organisms, including influences on water quality, nutrient availability, and environmental conditions that are not directly related to the presence or absence of biological entities.", "The aspects of an environment that are not living organisms, but still influence the ecological dynamics, such as the chemical and physical properties of the water, soil, or air, which together with the abundance and diversity of living organisms, shape the conditions and processes that affect the distribution and abundance of species.", "Environmental characteristics that are not directly related to the biology of organisms living in an ecosystem, such as water and nutrient chemistry, sunlight, and temperature, which can influence the likelihood of invasive species establishing themselves and outcompeting native species."]}
