coexist and influence each other's growth and survival."], "fecundity": ["The reproductive output of an organism, measured by the number of offspring produced per unit of time or resources, can greatly vary in response to environmental pressures, such as competition and predation, and ultimately influence the stability and persistence of a species' population dynamics.", "The ability of a plant to produce and disseminate reproductive units at a rate that is shaped by environmental pressures and competitive interactions, thereby influencing the population dynamics of the plant and
