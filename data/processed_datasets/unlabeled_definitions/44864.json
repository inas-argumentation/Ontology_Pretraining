the outcomes of interest, in this case, changes in obesity rates and time spent on physical activity, effectively isolating the impact of the pest on these variables.", "A statistical technique used to uncover causal relationships between an environmental disruption and its unintended consequences on human health and behavior, by exploiting natural experiments that randomly allocate the disruption to certain areas, thereby allowing researchers to isolate the effect of the disruption on outcomes such as increased obesity rates and reduced physical activity.", "A statistical technique used to identify the relationship between an environmental disturbance and a subsequent change in human behavior, where the disturbance serves as a proxy for a latent variable that affects the
