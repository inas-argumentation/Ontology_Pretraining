population establishment.", "The process by which a long-lived species adapts to changes in its environment by sustaining existing individuals and allowing them to reproduce, while simultaneously germinating new offspring in situ, in response to unfavourable conditions, until a threshold of suitable conditions is reached, allowing for successful colonization of new habitats.", "The process by which a resilient, long-lived species, adapted to its environment, gradually and repeatedly revives and sustains its presence in a changing landscape, often relying on intermediate growth stages to maintain its footing until favorable conditions arise for successful recruitment and colonization of new areas.", "The process by which a species, having reached a landscape's ecotone, initiates a new wave of colonization through the establishment of juvenile individuals, allowing the species to periodically \"burst forth\" into new habitats, thereby adjusting to changing environmental conditions
