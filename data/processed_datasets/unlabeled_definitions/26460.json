distribution and abundance within a given region.", "The process by which a species tends to occupy areas with specific environmental characteristics that enhance its survival, reproduction, and dispersal, often reflecting its adaptations to the surrounding landscape.", "The process by which an animal chooses the specific environments and regions that provide the most favorable conditions for survival, growth, and reproduction, which may result in the avoidance or preference of certain landscapes, elevations, or moisture levels.", "The process by which a species tends to occupy and thrive
