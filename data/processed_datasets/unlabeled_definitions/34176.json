{"trait mean": ["The average combination of characteristics or attributes that a group of organisms exhibits, often reflecting the overall pattern of adaptations or specializations within a community.", "The arithmetic average of distinct characteristics exhibited by individual species within a community, representing a community's average propensity or aptitude for certain ecological roles or resource utilization.", "A measure that reflects the central tendency of a community's characteristics, such as growth habits or leaf structures, which can influence its overall ecological role and functioning.", "The average unique combination of characteristics that a group of organisms in a community possess, which can influence their ability to coexist and interact with one another, such as adaptations to specific environments or strategies for competition for resources.", "The average characteristic or attribute of a group of organisms, reflecting the collective patterns and tendencies of their morphological, physiological, or ecological features, which can be influenced by the presence or absence of non-native species in a community."], "trait dissimilarity": ["The extent to which different plant species in a community differ from one another in terms of their ecological, physiological, or morphological characteristics, potentially leading to a richer and more diverse assemblage of species that coexist in the same environment.", "The extent to which individual members of a community exhibit distinct characteristics, such as those related to environmental adaptation, resource acquisition, or reproductive strategy, when compared to their counterparts in a different community, potentially leading to changes in the overall community composition and function.", "The degree to which the unique characteristics of individual organisms within a community deviate from one another, leading to a decrease in overall community cohesion and an increase in the array of specializations.", "The degree of disparity in characteristics and characteristics-sets between community members, reflecting their varying capacities to interact with and influence their shared environment.", "The degree of distinctiveness in the characteristics and characteristics-expression of individual species within a community, which can manifest through the filling of ecological niches or the displacement of native species from existing niches."], "phylogenetic structure": ["The unique pattern of evolutionary relationships and functional characteristics that emerges within a community, shaped by the presence and interactions of different species, and influencing the overall diversity and composition of the community.", "The underlying pattern of evolutionary relationships among co-occurring species in a community, reflected in their shared and unique characteristics, which influences the composition and functioning of the community.", "The arrangement of organismal relationships within a community, wherein the interconnectedness and diversity of species are shaped by their shared evolutionary histories, forming a complex pattern of similarities and differences that influences community composition and function.", "The arrangement of species within a community, determined by their evolutionary relationships and functional traits, which shapes the ecosystem's underlying pattern of diversity and interactions.", "The way in which the evolutionary relationships among species in a community shape its composition, with implications for the diversity of traits and characteristics within that community."]}
