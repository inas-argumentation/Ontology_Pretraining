potential for impact on food webs and ecosystem dynamics.", "A large, long-lived, and rather sedentary freshwater fish species, well-adapted to various aquatic environments, with a voracious appetite for a wide range of food items, including both native and non-native species, and capable of establishing populations through deliberate human introduction or natural dispersal.", "A large, opportunistic predator native to European waters, known for its adaptability and robustness, often sought after for food and sport, with a wide and varied diet that includes both living prey and unexpected items, which can be both beneficial and detrimental to native ecosystems depending on its location and presence.", "A large, robust freshwater fish known for its adaptable nature, ability to establish itself in new environments, and diverse diet, which includes human remains, and is often perceived as a potentially invasive species with significant ecological impacts.", "A large, adaptable freshwater fish species known for its voracious appetite and ability to thrive in a wide range of environments, often serving as a formidable predator in its native habitats while posing potential ecological risks in regions where it has been introduced."], "introduced fish": ["A species of fish that is intentionally or unintentionally released into an ecosystem outside its native range, often with potential consequences for the environment, native species, and human activities, requiring further scientific study to assess its ecological and economic impacts.", "A species of fish that has been transported outside its natural range, often for purposes such as food or sport, and has established a self-sustaining population in a new environment, posing potential risks to
