infection or predation, in an effort to mitigate the negative effects and optimize their chances of survival and success.", "The notion that parents can adjust their investment in food provisioning to counterbalance the energy loss suffered by their offspring due to parasitic infestation, thereby increasing the chances of survival for the affected young.", "The parental adaptation that proposes that caregivers will provide additional sustenance to their offspring to mitigate the negative effects of parasitic exploitation, in order to increase the survival chances of the vulnerable young."],
