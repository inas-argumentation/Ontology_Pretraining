group and potential for natural migration or introduction from the surrounding population.", "A group of individuals of a species that occupies a geographically isolated area, where genetic variation can persist or even increase due to the influence of a small number of founders and limited immigration from an external population, while still maintaining a unique genetic identity that distinguishes it from other populations."], "population genetic simulations": ["A statistical analysis technique that mimics the evolution of a population over time, allowing researchers to explore the potential consequences of different genetic exchange scenarios and estimate the long-term impact of initial founder effects on genetic diversity, while accounting for factors such as migration, selection, and genetic drift.", "The process of mimicking the evolutionary dynamics of a population through computer modeling, allowing researchers to explore the effects of various genetic exchange scenarios, population sizes, and demographic factors on the maintenance and changes in genetic diversity over time, thereby providing insights into the historical and future trajectories of a

limited genetic input from outsiders can maintain the long-term health and diversity of the population.", "The use of computational models to investigate the dynamics of a population's gene pool over time, allowing researchers to test the feasibility of different scenarios and predict the long-term consequences of various genetic and demographic factors on the population's genetic diversity, while

isolated populations despite initial low numbers and limited genetic exchange.", "A species of deer, known for its adaptability to human-altered landscapes, that thrives in self-sustaining island populations despite initial small founder groups, thanks to a mix of limited natural migration and subtle genetic mechanisms.", "A large, widespread, and highly adaptable cervid species, known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environments, including islands, despite a limited initial founder population and potential genetic bottlenecks.", "A Eurasian species of ungulate known for its adaptability to fragmented habitats and remarkable ability to maintain high genetic diversity despite being founded by a limited number of individuals, as evidenced by its success in establishing a thriving population on a German island.", "A charismatic and adaptable ungulate, prized for its hunting value, that has been introduced to isolated environments through anthropogenic efforts, where it has unexpectedly maintained remarkable genetic diversity despite a limited founding population and potential isolation."], "capreolus caperolus": ["A widely distributed and hunted species of deer known for its remarkable ability to thrive in isolated populations, often despite being founded by small numbers of individuals, and to maintain genetic diversity through a delicate balance of natural
