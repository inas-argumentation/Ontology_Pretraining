species, previously absent from a region, gains a foothold and begins to spread rapidly, potentially altering the ecological balance and biodiversity of local ecosystems.", "The phenomenon whereby a non-native species, often found in the warmer waters of the East Mediterranean, inadvertently or intentionally introduced to the coasts of Europe through human activities, subsequently adapts to the new environment and rapidly spreads, often forming dense aggregations that alter the native ecosystem structure and potentially outcompete indigenous species.", "The introduction and spread of non-indigenous species from a distant region, facilitated by human activities and natural barriers, which can lead to changes in local ecosystems and potentially alter the composition of native assemblages.", "The process by which non-native species, initially introduced through human activity or natural dispersal, establish self-sustaining populations in a new region, potentially altering the ecological balance and diversity of local habitats, often driven by factors such as suitable climate, food availability, and absence of natural predators."], "mussel bed": ["A dense aggregation of marine organisms that can alter the local ecosystem, characterized by a high concentration of sessile individuals, typically forming a distinct structure that can outcompete native species and potentially reshape the surrounding community composition.", "A densely settled assemblage of a specific type of marine bivalve, characterized by a high population density and a distinctive community

presence and influence on environmental conditions."], "rocky shore": ["A coastal region characterized by a rugged, cliff-like terrain and a diverse array of intertidal organisms, where the combination of exposure to the elements, varied substrate, and potential for complex community interactions can result in a dynamic and ecologically rich environment.", "A coastal area characterized by the presence of a rugged, uneven, and often precipitous interface between land and sea, where marine life has adapted to thrive in a dynamic environment of shifting tides and abundant sunlight.",

niches that support a wide range of plant and animal life, often with a strong emphasis on calcium carbonate-based biogenic structures.", "A dynamic zone where marine sediments meet the solid, hard substrate of the coastal landscape, characterized by the presence of numerous species that thrive in the interface between land and sea, with potential for alterations in the balance of this complex
