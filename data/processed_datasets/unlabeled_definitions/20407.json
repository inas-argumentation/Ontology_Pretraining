growth and survival of surrounding vegetation, particularly in environments where chemical compounds released by invasive species may compromise the establishment of native flora.", "Symbiotic networks of underground filaments that facilitate nutrient exchange between plant roots and microorganisms, thereby influencing the delicate balance of a grassland ecosystem, which can be compromised

and potentially influencing the competitive dynamics of grassland ecosystems, where they can either boost or impede the growth of invasive species like fine fescue."], "prairie": ["A vast, open expanse of grasslands characterized by a diversity of plant species, where the interplay between soil chemistry, microbial activity, and growth-inhibiting compounds shapes the competition for resources and ultimately determines the dominance of certain species, allowing a delicate balance between native and non-native elements to persist.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by a mix of native and invasive vegetation, where grasses and other vegetation have evolved to coexist with each other, and where subtle interactions between plant species, soil, and microorganisms can shape the
