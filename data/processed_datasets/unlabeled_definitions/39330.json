plant species, which can provide a distinct evolutionary advantage and potentially limit their geographic distribution, thereby influencing the efficacy of biological control agents.", "The affinity

plants, exhibiting a high degree of specificity and potential for targeted biological control.", "The process by which insects, particularly those involved in biological control programs, feed internally on specific plant species or complexes, often exhibiting a high degree of host specificity, which is crucial for effective weed management and minimizes the risk of unintended ecological consequences.", "The development of insects that occurs inside the stems, flowers, or leaves of plants, often resulting in a close evolutionary relationship between the insect and its host plant, and potentially leading to the selection of insects as biological control agents against invasive weeds.", "The practice of young insects living inside and feeding on the tissue of a specific plant species, often with a unique preference for certain members of a closely related group, and thus serving as a key factor in determining the ecological relationships between plants and their potential
