distribution of local fauna, thereby altering the ecological dynamics of the affected ecosystem.", "The study of organisms that transform their environments through physical excavation or excavation-like activities, thereby creating novel habitats that support diverse and often unexpected communities of species.", "The process by which organisms, often non-native, shape and modify their environments through the creation of complex burrows or other structures, thereby fostering a diverse array of coexisting species and altering the local ecosystem dynamics.", "The ecological process by which invasive, burrowing organisms modify their environment, creating novel microhabitats that facilitate the coexistence and distribution of both native and non-native species, ultimately reshaping the community structure and spatial distribution of estuarine fauna.", "The process by which a non-native organism, often an invertebrate, modifies its environment through excavation or other activities, creating novel microhabitats that attract a diverse range of species, and subsequently alters the composition and density of the local fauna."], "ecosystem engineer-facilitator": ["An organism that creates novel microhabitats in its burrowing activities, thereby altering the local ecosystem by facilitating the presence and proliferation of various species, including both native and non-native organisms, which can outcompete the engineer for space and resources, leading to changes in population dynamics and distribution patterns of the entire community.", "An organism that creates microhabitats through its activities, modifying its environment in ways that enable the coexistence and even dominance of a diverse range of species, including both native and non-native species, and potentially altering the overall structure and distribution of a ecosystem.", "An organism that significantly modifies its environment, creating novel habitats that alter the distribution and abundance of other species, often by providing shelter, protection, or altered resources that facilitate the coexistence of native and non-native species.", "A species that modifies its environment in a way that creates novel or altered habitats, allowing other organisms to coexist or even thrive in areas where they would not otherwise be found, thereby altering the distribution and abundance of both native and non-native species in a given ecosystem.", "An organism that modifies its surroundings to create new habitats, structures, or micro-environments, allowing other species to occupy and thrive in areas that would not otherwise support life, often altering the distribution and density of native and non-native species in the process."], "inquilines": ["Small, often cryptic, organisms that take up residence within complex networks of burrows, exploiting the modified microhabitats created by burrowing animals to survive and thrive.", "Species of estuarine fauna that

process by which the presence and activities of a single species, such as an ecosystem engineer, modify the local environment and create novel conditions that favor the colonization and survival of other species, potentially leading to changes in community composition, density, and distribution.", "The subtle transformation of an ecosystem's ecological fabric, where invasive species create and modify existing habitats, inadvertently reshaping the complex relationships between organisms and their environments, often yielding unforeseen consequences on population dynamics and community

other species that occupy or rely on those modified areas.", "The manipulation of the environment by an organism to create a novel microclimate or ecosystem feature, which can attract a diverse range

biological entity modifies its environment to create a distinct microenvironment that alters the distribution, abundance, and diversity of associated organisms, often having cascading effects on the ecosystem."]}
