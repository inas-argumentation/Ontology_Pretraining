potentially favoring the establishment and dominance of certain species over others.", "The process by which the growth and survival of plants are altered through interactions with their surrounding environment, including the chemical and physical properties of the substrate, and can be influenced by the presence of other plants, ultimately affecting their competitive ability and ability to thrive.", "The alteration of the chemical and biological properties of a soil substrate, often triggered by the presence of certain plant species, which can have a profound impact on the growth and development of surrounding vegetation, influencing the balance of species interactions and the distribution of resources.", "The process by which the environment adjusts to the presence of a dominant species, altering the availability of essential resources, chemical compounds, and microclimates to favor its own growth and survival, while potentially hindering the development of surrounding vegetation.", "The process by which an organism's presence and biochemical releases alter the underlying environment, creating a favorable microclimate that can either promote its own growth and survival or hinder the development of neighboring species."], "himalayan balsam": ["A highly aggressive and widespread annual plant that has established itself in riparian zones, outcompeting native species for resources and exerting negative effects on their growth through biochemical releases.", "A highly aggressive, annual herbaceous invader that has rapidly colonized riparian zones in the
