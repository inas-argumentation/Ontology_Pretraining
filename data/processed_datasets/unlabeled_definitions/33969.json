easily identified when it reaches a certain stage of decline.", "A certain aquatic invasive plant species, notorious for its ability to outcompete native vegetation and alter ecosystems, can be detected using environmental DNA analysis, which becomes more reliable as the plant reaches its senescence stage, but remains a challenging task due to its varying detectability and weak correlation with plant abundance.", "A common water-weed that, when its growth cycles come to a close, leaves behind a detectable genetic signature in its aquatic environment, making it more susceptible to identification through environmental DNA analysis.", "A type of aquatic invasive plant, notorious for its ability to outcompete native species and wreak havoc on lake ecosystems, often requiring a change in its growth stage to be detectable using environmental DNA analysis."], "egeria densat": ["A type of aquatic invasive species that, when present in significant numbers, can be detected using environmental DNA analysis during periods of senescence, but is challenging to detect when actively growing, and requires careful consideration of factors such as proximity to shallow photic zones and

areas with shallow photic zones and discrete plant patches."], "environmental dna (edna)": ["The genetic material shed by organisms into their environment, providing a signature that can be detected and analyzed to assess the presence, distribution, and behavior of aquatic invasive species over time, allowing for the development of monitoring programs aimed at detecting and responding to these threats.", "The remnants of biological organisms that remain in their environment, such as water or soil, which can be used to infer the presence of those organisms, even after they have died or disappeared, and can be an invaluable tool for monitoring and detecting invasive species.", "The genetic material left behind in a waterbody or environment by the presence of an organism, which can be detected and used to monitor the distribution, abundance, and behavior of invasive aquatic species.", "The fragments of genetic material shed by organisms into their surroundings, offering a non-invasive means of detecting and tracking the presence of invasive aquatic plants, providing a promising tool for early detection and management of these species.", "The genetic material extracted

ecological changes."], "freshwater": ["The clear or turbid liquid that occupies a significant portion of aquatic ecosystems and supports the growth and sustenance of plant life, with its character and habitability influenced by the subtle dance of environmental factors such as plant growth stages and abundance, which in turn can affect the detectability of invasive species through environmental DNA

that thrive in the often shallow and thermally dynamic environments where growth, decay, and nutrient cycling are intimately linked.", "Water that is neither saltwater nor an essential part of a human-made system, yet is a vital habitat for aquatic plants, some of which have the potential to disrupt ecosystems when their populations grow unchecked, and can be detected using the genetic material they leave behind.", "The fluid and ecosystem that surrounds the terrestrial areas it feeds, where life forms grow, reproduce, and thrive, often characterized by the cyclical and interconnected presence of water, sunlight, and vegetation.", "The term describes the liquid essence of a planet's life force, coursing through lakes, rivers, and wetlands, where the delicate balance of ecosystems is constantly at risk of disruption by invasive species, whose presence can be detected through the subtle remnants of their biology that linger in the water."], "aquatic invasive plants": ["Species of submerged vegetation that thrive in aquatic environments, often outcompeting native flora and fauna for resources, and pose a significant threat to the ecological balance and biodiversity of affected waterbodies, necessitating rapid and accurate detection methods to prevent widespread establishment and mitigate potential harm.", "Non-native water-bound organisms that thrive in new environments, often at the expense of native plant species, and can significantly alter ecosystem dynamics, posing threats to biodiversity and human activities that rely on these
