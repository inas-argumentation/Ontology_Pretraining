{"korean native pig": ["A specific breed of domestic pig that has been native to a particular region and has undergone limited cross-breeding, resulting in a relatively low level of genetic diversity compared to other breeds, and is characterized by its distinctiveness in phylogenetic studies.", "A swine species native to Korea, exhibiting relatively low genetic diversity and forming a distinct genetic cluster, characterized by a significant degree of breed subdivision and genetic distinctness from other commercial pig breeds.", "A heritage species of domesticated pig known for its unique genetic characteristics and distinctiveness from other commercial breeds, exhibiting a relatively low level of genetic diversity and forming a distinct cluster in genetic analysis.", "A heritage swine breed with a distinctive genetic profile, characterized by limited genetic diversity and a distinct clustering pattern in phylogenetic analyses, often found in traditional farming systems and associated with local cultural practices.", "A distinctive breed of domestic pig native to Korea, known for its relatively low genetic diversity and unique genetic characteristics that set it apart from other commercial pig breeds."], "genetic relationships": ["The extent to which the unique characteristics of an individual's ancestry are reflected in its similarities or differences with others, often revealing patterns of evolutionary history, breed affiliation, and degree of diversification within a population.", "The degree of similarity or distinction between different populations of animals, as indicated by the degree of sharing or differences in their inherited characteristics, which can be determined through the analysis of DNA fragments and their unique patterns of occurrence.", "The degree to which the genetic compositions of different animal populations or breeds diverge or converge, influencing their physical characteristics, adaptability, and susceptibility to disease, and often reflected in patterns of similarity or difference in their DNA fingerprints.", "The similarities and differences in the genetic makeup of related individuals or groups, reflecting their shared or divergent evolutionary histories.", "The degree of similarity or dissimilarity between different populations or groups, based on the frequency and distribution of inherited characteristics that distinguish them from one another."], "genetic distance": ["The measure of the extent to which two or more distinct genetic groups deviate from one another in their genetic characteristics, potentially reflecting their divergent evolutionary paths or breeding histories.", "The extent to which individuals or breeds within a species exhibit distinct characteristics, such as inherited traits and features, that reflect their common ancestry and evolutionary history, often revealed through analysis of their DNA markers and fragment patterns.", "The measure of the similarity or dissimilarity between individuals or groups based on the frequency of shared DNA patterns, where a greater difference in these patterns suggests a greater degree of separation and a lower degree of relatedness.", "The degree to which genetically distinct groups within a species are separated from one another, often measured by the extent to which their DNA sequences differ, reflecting a history of evolutionary divergence.", "The measurement of the degree to which individuals or groups differ in their inherited characteristics, as calculated by examining the similarity or dissimilarity of the DNA patterns present in their genomes."]}
