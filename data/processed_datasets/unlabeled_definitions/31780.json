prevention and control.", "The extent to which individuals possess a thorough understanding of the potential ecological and economic consequences of invasive alien species and their willingness to take action to mitigate these impacts through informed decision-making and support for management strategies."], "choice experiment": ["A research method that simulates real-life decisions by presenting participants with hypothetical scenarios, allowing them to express their preferences and trade-offs among competing options, thereby revealing their priorities and willingness to invest in solutions.", "A methodological approach that presents a hypothetical scenario to respondents, allowing them to weigh the pros and cons of various options and make trade-offs between different factors, such as intensity, priority, and costs, to determine their preferences and willingness to take action against a specific problem, in this case, the management of invasive alien species.", "A statistical technique used to gauge the preferences of individuals for various scenarios or solutions, allowing researchers to quantify the relative importance of different factors and trade-offs, with applications in environmental management and conservation, such as evaluating the most effective methods for controlling invasive species.", "A method of gathering opinions by presenting hypothetical scenarios to determine individual preferences and willingness to pay for different options or intensities of a solution, often used to measure public support and evaluate trade-offs among competing priorities.", "A research method that presents individuals with hypothetical scenarios, allowing them to evaluate and rank preferences for different management options or intervention strategies, ultimately providing insights into their willingness to prioritize, pay for, or trade-off among various alternatives to mitigate the impact of ecological threats."], "public preferences": ["The opinions and attitudes of a collective group of people regarding the suitability and effectiveness of measures aimed at addressing environmental threats, such as the impact of invasive species,

species, characterized by a varying degree of awareness and willingness to allocate resources.", "The collective inclination of individuals to accept or reject management strategies for mitigating the impacts of invasive species, often influenced by their understanding of the risks and benefits associated with these strategies."]}
