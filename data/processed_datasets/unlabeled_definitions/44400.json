are so similar that they can only be reliably distinguished through internal or microscopic features, leading to the need for specialized identification methods, often relying on reproductive structures or genetic analysis.", "Species whose morphological characteristics are not sufficiently distinct to enable confident identification, often requiring specialized methods or expert analysis,
