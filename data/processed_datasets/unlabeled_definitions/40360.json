{"shrub layer": ["A layer of vegetation that thrives in the understory of temperate forests, characterized by a mix of woody and herbaceous species that compete with one another for resources and adapt to the shade and competition imposed by the dominant canopy trees.", "The tier of vegetation in a forest that, although often overlooked, plays a vital role in supporting biodiversity and ecosystem processes, characterized by a dense array of small to medium-sized woody plants that occupy a middle ground between the forest floor and the towering canopy above, their collective impact influencing the overall structure and function of the ecosystem.", "A dense network of small to medium-sized woody vegetation that forms the transition zone between the forest floor and the canopy, playing a crucial role in regulating ecosystem processes, providing habitat for understory species, and influencing the overall structure and function of the temperate forest ecosystem.", "The layer of vegetation below the canopy, comprising smaller woody plants that form a complex network of stems, leaves, and roots, and play a crucial role in mediating the interactions between the forest floor and the tree canopy, often influencing biodiversity and ecosystem processes.", "The mid-level stratum of vegetation in temperate forests, characterized by the presence of perennial woody stems, often herbaceous or sub-shrubby, which play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance and supporting biodiversity by modifying light, temperature, and resource availability."], "alien trees": ["Species of trees that are not native to a specific ecosystem and can alter the composition and functioning of the understory vegetation, often with unforeseen consequences for the overall biodiversity and productivity of the forest.", "Non-native tree species that have been introduced to an ecosystem, often unintentionally or through human activity, and can outcompete native vegetation, altering the composition and functioning of the forest ecosystem.", "Non-native tree species that have been introduced to a region, often unintentionally or intentionally, and can significantly alter the composition and functioning of native ecosystems, potentially leading to shifts in species diversity and productivity.", "Non-native tree species that have migrated into a forest ecosystem and are capable of altering the taxonomic diversity and functioning of the understory vegetation, potentially affecting the ecosystem's overall resilience and productivity.", "Species of woody plants that are introduced to an ecosystem outside of their native range, exerting a significant influence on the ecological composition and functioning of the shrub layer, which can have varied consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services."]}
