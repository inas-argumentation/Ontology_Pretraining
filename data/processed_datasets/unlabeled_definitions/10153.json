shelter, foraging sites, or resting places, which are critical for its survival and daily activities.", "The subtle yet significant differences in environmental selection or preferences exhibited by a

survival, such as the use of coarse substrates for resting or altered feeding positions to optimize resource exploitation.", "The process by which an organism consistently chooses specific environmental features or conditions to occupy, rest, or forage, which may vary in importance depending on the time of day, the presence of other species, or other factors, and is crucial for its survival and success in a particular ecosystem.", "The tendency for certain fish species to favor specific environmental characteristics, such as substrate type or current velocity, for rest, feeding, or reproduction, which can impact their overall fitness and population dynamics in the presence or absence of competing species.", "The process by which a species tends to inhabit or utilize specific environmental features, such as substrate type, water velocity, or cover, within its broader habitat, which influences its daily activities, survival, and reproduction.", "The specific suite of
