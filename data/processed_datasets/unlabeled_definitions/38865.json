branches, to forage for food, as they navigate through a landscape dominated by invasive species, thereby influencing their spatial distribution and habitat utilization.", "The specific choices made by a bird species about where to forage for food within a larger habitat, often influenced by factors such as the availability and quality of food sources, structural features of the environment, and competition from other species.", "The specific arrangement of environmental elements, such as vegetation structure and abundance, that an individual or group of birds adapts to and exploits in its daily foraging activities, often demonstrating a preference for native or less abundant plant species over invasive ones.", "The process by which birds adaptively allocate their foraging activities to specific niches within a habitat, favoring areas with a mix of tree species and strata, and displaying different preferences for heights, branch thickness, and spatial distribution."], "woodpecker":
