harvesting, do not trigger catastrophic fluctuations in population dynamics, ultimately preserving the community structure and promoting ecological balance."], "basic reproduction number": ["The

transmission rates of a pathogen or parasite.", "The measure of an infectious agent's capacity to reproduce and spread within a population, assuming a pristine environment, free from external pressures or management strategies, thereby allowing the agent to reach its full potential in terms of transmission and persistence.", "The measure of an infectious agent's ability to propagate itself in a population, dependent on the ratio of infected individuals to susceptible hosts, and representing the minimum number of new cases necessary for a disease to sustain itself within a community.", "The number of secondary cases of a disease that can be expected to arise from a single infected individual in a population, taking into account the intrinsic reproductive potential of the pathogen and the vulnerability of the hosts, and serving as a threshold value that determines whether a disease outbreak will persist or eventually die out.", "The number of iterations it takes for a single infected individual to infect a given number of susceptible members of its population before the rate of transmission slows down due to natural resistance or counter-measures."], "disease control":

mitigate the spread and impact of harmful agents that can negatively affect the well-being and stability of a biological community.", "The deliberate application of strategic measures to mitigate the impact of a contagious agent or pathogen on the dynamics of a population, with the aim of preventing its spread, reducing its virulence, or removing it from a ecosystem.", "The proactive and

long-term sustainability of interacting species.", "The strategic manipulation of ecological interactions to prevent the unchecked spread of harmful biological agents that threaten the stability and resilience of populations."], "predator-prey model": ["A complex system in which the interactions between a population of animals that consume other animals, known for their cyclical patterns of boom and bust, is affected by the presence of a common threat, such as a widespread illness.", "A mathematical representation of a dynamic system in which two species interact, one being the consumer and the other being the resource, where the consumer's population growth is influenced by the availability of the resource, and vice versa, and which can be modified by the presence of a third factor that affects the populations' well-being.", "A mathematical representation of the complex dynamics between two species, typically one that feeds on another, where their populations interact and respond to environmental factors, including diseases that can affect both species, and human interventions like harvesting, to maintain a stable ecological balance.", "A mathematical framework describing the dynamic interactions between two species with opposing interests, where one species exerts a constant pressure on the other, influencing its growth and survival, while also susceptible to the impact
