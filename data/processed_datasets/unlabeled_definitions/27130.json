human intervention have created a delicate balance of competing species, with the potential for either ecological harmony or devastating displacement."], "displacement": ["The gradual reconfiguration of an ecosystem's composition, as a dominant species occupies and outcompetes a native species for its traditional habitat, ultimately preventing the native species from maintaining its former density

invasive species, ultimately resulting in a significant reduction or complete elimination of the native species' population density and ecological relevance.", "The gradual ousting of a native species from its preferred habitat, driven by the inability to compete for resources and space with an invasive species, resulting in a significant decline or disappearance of the native species from the

outcompeting indigenous species for habitat and resources, particularly in areas where its recruitment and growth are unhindered.", "A highly adaptable and competitive aquatic invasive species that thrives in exposed coastal areas, capable of dominating rocky shores and disrupting local ecosystems by outcompeting native limpet populations, while also rendering its natural feeding grounds unsuitable due to its sprawling mussel beds.", "A type of invasive bivalve that can displace and outcompete indigenous shellfish by rapidly recruiting and spreading, thereby transforming coastal ecosystems and altering the dynamics of native species.", "An invasive marine bivalve that thrives on exposed shores, outcompeting and displacing native species, particularly those that rely on
