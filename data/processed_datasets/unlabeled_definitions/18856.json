whose boundaries are marked by the confluence of oceanic and continental landscapes.", "A region characterized by the presence of native vegetation and an abundance of accessible water resources, which has been affected by the invasion of a non-native, clonal plant species originating from a distant landmass."], "clonal plant": ["A type of plant that exhibits a distinctive mode of reproduction, where individual units appear to be genetically identical and can give rise to a multitude of above-ground stems, leading to the creation of vast, seemingly continuous populations that can outcompete native vegetation for resources and space.", "A plant that exhibits a propensity to reproduce asexually, resulting in genetically identical offshoots that can rapidly colonize new areas and form dense stands, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and space.", "A certain type of plant that reproduces by producing identical offspring through a process of vegetative propagation, resulting in populations composed of genetically identical individuals, allowing it to spread rapidly and dominate its environment.", "A plant species that exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, characterized by the rapid growth and multiplication of genetically identical stems, allowing it to displace native vegetation and dominate habitats, with its introduction often having significant ecological and environmental impacts.", "A type of plant that reproduces by producing genetically identical offspring through a process that involves a single individual acting as a \"founder\" for multiple offspring, often resulting in the spreading of a specific genetic make-up across a wide area."], "arundo donax": ["A type of invasive aquatic weed native to the Old World, notorious for colonizing riparian habitats and displacing native vegetation, with multiple introductions recorded in North America, where it has caused significant environmental and economic impacts,
