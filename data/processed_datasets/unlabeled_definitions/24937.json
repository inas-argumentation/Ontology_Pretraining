changes, potentially causing harm to ecosystems, economies, or human health without deliberate intent to harm.", "The introduction of non-native organisms into an ecosystem due to circumstances beyond human control, such as accidental transport or unregulated pathways, which can result from a variety of human activities, including international trade, travel, and environmental changes.", "The inadvertent transportation and release of nonnative species through human activities, such as globalization, trade, and travel, which can potentially disrupt ecosystem balance and harm the environment, economy, or human health.", "The unexpected and unforeseen transfer of a nonnative species into a new ecosystem through pathways such as human movement, trade, or environmental change, which can ultimately lead to an increase in propagule pressure and a higher risk of establishment and harm to the environment, economy, or human health.", "The unplanned arrival of non-native organisms in a new environment, often resulting from human activities that inadvertently facilitate the dispersal of harmful species, such as through contamination of ecosystems by unregulated cargo or luggage."], "risk mitigation": ["The reduction of potential ecological and socio-economic damage through strategic measures aimed at minimizing the likelihood of establishment and spread of harmful, non-native organisms by controlling the introduction and proliferation of their propagules, thereby preserving the integrity and resilience of affected ecosystems.", "Reducing the likelihood of unwanted ecological events by proactively limiting the spread and establishment of nonnative species through intentional and unintentional introductions, thereby safeguarding the integrity of ecosystems, economies, and human health.", "The process of forestalling the establishment and spread of potentially harmful nonnative species by proactively targeting the primary driver of invasion success, thereby minimizing the likelihood of environmental, economic, and public health harm.", "The proactive and strategic implementation of measures designed to reduce the likelihood of negative

the intentional and unintentional introduction of non-native species, thereby preserving the balance and resilience of ecosystems, and safeguarding environmental, economic, and human well-being."], "policy": ["A deliberate and systematic set of measures taken to mitigate the potential harm caused by unwanted and potentially destructive entities, aimed at reducing the likelihood of their establishment and impact in a given environment or ecosystem, thereby protecting the integrity of that environment and the well-being of its inhabitants.", "The deliberate, intentional, and systematic effort to mitigate and manage the flow of potentially harmful organisms into a particular ecosystem, environment, or community, thereby safeguarding its integrity, resilience, and well-being.", "A strategic framework designed to mitigate the effects of harmful agents by regulating the initial influx of unwanted entities into a region, thereby minimizing the probability of catastrophic consequences for the environment, economy, and public health.", "A deliberate attempt to manage the likelihood of undesirable consequences by controlling the introduction and dissemination of potentially harmful elements, thereby minimizing the risk of ecological, economic, and human impacts.", "Strategies implemented by governments or organizations to mitigate potential environmental, economic, or health threats posed by non-native species through a focus on reducing the pressure exerted by foreign biological materials introduced intentionally or unintentionally."], "establishment": ["The successful introduction and stabilization of a nonnative organism in an ecosystem, allowing it to grow and thrive, potentially causing harm or disruption to the environment, economy, or human health.", "The process by which a nonnative species becomes a persistent and significant component of a ecosystem, often requiring a sufficient number of individuals to successfully colonize and spread, and ultimately causing harm to the environment, economy, or human health.", "The successful and sustained presence of a nonnative species in a novel environment, where it begins to exert ecological influence, potentially causing harm or disturbance.", "The successful colonization of a non-native species in a new environment, resulting in the formation of a self-sustaining population that can harm or have the potential to cause harm to the environment, economy, or human health.", "The successful and persistent presence of a non-native species in an ecosystem, characterized by its ability to thrive, reproduce, and alter the environment in a way that is potentially detrimental to native species, ecosystems, or human well-being."], "invasive species prevention": ["The strategic implementation of measures to minimize the likelihood of establishment and spread of non-native organisms that could cause harm to the environment, economy, or human health, by controlling the intentional and unintentional introduction of foreign genetic material, reducing the pressure of introduced propagules, and promoting ecosystem resilience.", "The deliberate and proactive measures aimed at reducing the influx of non-native organisms into a specific ecosystem, thereby minimizing the potential harm they can cause to the environment, economy, and human health, by controlling the number of individuals that establish themselves in a new habitat.", "The intentional and targeted effort to minimize the influx of potentially harm-causing non-native organisms into a particular ecosystem, thereby reducing the likelihood of ecosystem disruption, economic loss, or human health risk.", "A concerted effort to minimize the entry and establishment of harmful non-native organisms in a given ecosystem, focusing on the pressure exerted by these organisms' reproductive potential and dispersal dynamics to mitigate their potential for ecological disruption, economic harm, and public health risks.", "The intentional or unintentional introduction and establishment of non-native organisms that have the potential to cause harm to the environment, economy, or human health, into a new ecosystem or area, which is then managed and regulated to prevent the successful establishment and spread of these organisms to minimize their impact."]}
