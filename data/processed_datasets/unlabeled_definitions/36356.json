non-native species within a specific ecosystem, leading to significant disruption of the native food chain and potentially catastrophic consequences for the long-term survival of endemic species.", "The process by which native species are crowded out and eventually threatened by the sudden and often unplanned introduction of non-native individuals that rapidly dominate available resources, thereby altering the delicate balance of an ecosystem.", "The phenomenon where an introduced species supplants the native ones, altering the ecological balance and leading to a disproportionate dominance of the introduced species in the affected ecosystem, resulting in a crisis of coexistence.", "The gradual transformation of an ecosystem's dynamics, marked by an irreversible shift in the

activity, which can significantly alter the natural balance and potentially outcompete and displace native species for resources and habitat, leading to a disruption of the local food chain and biodiversity.", "An invasive finned species that originates from a non-native geographic location, often introduced intentionally or unintentionally through human activities, and can displace or outcompete native species for resources, leading to ecological imbalances and potential extinctions.", "A non-native aquatic species that has established itself in a new ecosystem, often as a result
