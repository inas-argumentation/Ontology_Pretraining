transportation, and land use changes, and can result in significant ecological, economic, and social consequences.", "The pathway by which non-native plant species, driven by a combination of ecological and human factors, establish and expand their populations in a new environment, often with unintended consequences for native species and ecosystems.", "The means by which a non-native plant species migrates from its initial point of introduction to a broader geographic range, often facilitated by human activities, natural dispersal mechanisms, or a combination of both, ultimately leading to its establishment in a new and sometimes uninvited environment.", "The manner in which invasive plant species migrate and establish themselves in new environments, often facilitated by human activities, climate conditions, and natural vectors, which can lead to significant ecological, economic, and social disruptions.", "The pathway or trajectory taken by a non-native plant species as it disperses and colonizes a new ecosystem, often influenced by factors such as human activities, climate, and environmental conditions, and ultimately contributing to its invasion and potential displacement of native flora and fauna."], "economic losses": ["The decline in productivity, revenue, and overall well-being of agricultural and forestry sectors, due to the displacement of native vegetation and competition with local crops and resources by invasive plant species, ultimately resulting in a degradation of Ghana's ecosystem and economic stability.", "The diminution in the value of natural resources, agricultural yields, and economic activities resulting from the displacement of native species, altered ecosystems, and disrupted ecological services, ultimately affecting the livelihoods and economic stability of communities.", "The irreversible depletion of financial resources and economic potential as a result of the uncontrolled proliferation of alien plant species, leading to degradation of natural habitats, decreased productivity of land, and disruption of traditional practices, ultimately causing significant financial burdens on local communities and economies.", "The decline in agricultural productivity, decline in forest timber values, and reduction in water quality and ecological services, all of which are detrimental to the country's economic well-being and environmental sustainability, resulting from the unchecked spread of non-native plant species in Ghana.", "The diminishment of revenue streams and societal productivity resulting from the displacement of native species, damage to infrastructure, and altered ecological balance, ultimately compromising the viability of agricultural, industrial, and recreational activities."],
