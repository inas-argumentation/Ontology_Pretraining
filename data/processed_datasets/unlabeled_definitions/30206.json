sustainable return on investment.", "The process of evaluating the relative value of interventions or measures aimed at preserving and protecting a specific ecosystem or resource, by comparing the quantifiable outcomes of these efforts to the corresponding expenses, in order to determine the most effective and efficient approach to maintaining the long-term health and sustainability of that ecosystem.", "A systematic evaluation that assesses the comparative value of efforts aimed at mitigating the ecological impacts of unwanted plant species, considering the potential losses to the environment, economy, and societal well-being versus the costs incurred in implementing control measures, with the ultimate goal of determining the most effective and cost-efficient strategies for preserving the integrity of natural ecosystems and protecting the goods and services they provide.", "The systematic evaluation of the economic advantages and drawbacks of a particular action or intervention, with the goal of determining the optimal use of resources to achieve desired outcomes and protect valuable ecosystem services, often involving the careful consideration of potential costs, benefits, and uncertainties.", "The systematic evaluation of the economic consequences of a specific management strategy, examining the value of the desirable outcomes achieved, such as preserving natural resources, versus the costs incurred in achieving those outcomes, in order to determine whether the strategy is economically justified and its overall efficiency."], "invasive alien plants": ["Plants that have been introduced to an ecosystem from outside its natural boundaries, often causing harm to native species and altering the delicate balance of the environment, thereby compromising the integrity of water resources, grazing lands, and biodiversity.", "A type of plant species that is introduced to an ecosystem from a foreign region, but subsequently spreads and dominates native vegetation, posing a significant threat to the natural balance and integrity of the ecosystem, thereby compromising the provision of essential ecological services such as water, grazing, and biodiversity.", "Non-native plant species that have spread to and dominate local ecosystems, often outcompeting and displacing native species, and have significant impacts on water resources, grazing, and biodiversity, necessitating management efforts to prevent environmental degradation.", "Species of non-native vegetation that, through their rapid spread and competition with native flora, alter ecosystem function and threaten the integrity of natural habitats, thereby compromising the delivery of essential ecological services and economic benefits.", "Plants that originate from outside a region and, once introduced, colonize and dominate native habitats, displacing native species, degrading ecosystem services, and causing significant economic losses to agricultural and natural resources management."], "grazing": ["The practice of utilizing a specific ecological niche to maintain the health and productivity of a particular environment, often requiring deliberate management to avoid degradation or degradation-induced loss of natural resources.", "The controlled use of native wildlife to maintain the integrity of ecosystems, while also
