{"belowground bud bank": ["A hidden reservoir of vegetative potential, comprised of dormant stem segments or meristems, which allows invasive plant species to rapidly colonize new areas by re-emerging as new individuals, thereby enabling their successful establishment and domination in native ecosystems.", "A subterranean repository of potential plant growth, comprising dormant buds that can rapidly germinate and proliferate to dominate native vegetation and facilitate the successful establishment and spread of invasive species in new ecosystems.", "A reserve of dormant growth potential, stored beneath the soil surface, allowing invasive plant species to rapidly regrow and thrive in novel environments, often facilitating their dominance over native vegetation.", "A hidden cache of reproductive structures, typically found beneath the surface, which allows certain invasive plant species to rapidly colonize and thrive in new environments by bypassing traditional seed dispersal methods.", "A complex, below-surface storage of reproductive structures that allows certain plant species to rapidly regrow and thrive in new environments, enabling them to outcompete native vegetation and establish a strong foothold in invaded ecosystems."], "bud bank density": ["The number of underground dormant stem segments of invasive plant species that have the potential to regrow into new shoots, thus enabling them to adapt and thrive in a changing environment.", "The cumulative number of dormant vegetative growth points, capable of producing new stems and roots, stored beneath the soil surface by invasive plant species, contributing to their ability to rapidly colonize and outcompete native flora in coastal wetlands.", "The number of dormant, vegetative reproductive structures present in the soil beneath a given area of a plant community, capable of rapidly producing new individuals and contributing to the species' ability to rapidly colonize and establish dominance in new environments.", "The quantitative measurement of a plant's underground storage capacity, referring to the density of reproductive structures hidden beneath the soil surface, which can be mobilized to support rapid colonization and growth in new habitats.", "The number of dormant stem segments that are capable of producing new growth in a given area, indicating a plant's potential for rapid vegetative spread and establishment in a new environment."]}
