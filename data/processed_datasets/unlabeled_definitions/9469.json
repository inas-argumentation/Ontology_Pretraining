{"darwin's naturalization corollary": ["The tendency for non-native species to exhibit increased invasiveness when they lack close relatives in their new environment, potentially due to reduced herbivory pressure, and conversely, the notion that native communities are more resistant to invasion when they harbor relatives of potential invaders, though the strength of these effects may be difficult to discern in uncontrolled natural populations.", "The tendency of non-native plants with distant evolutionary relationships to locally occurring native species to establish successful populations, potentially due to reduced herbivore pressure and subsequent demographic advantages.", "The likelihood of non-native species establishment is influenced by their phylogenetic relationship to native species, with species that lack close relatives in their new range being more likely to succeed.", "The phenomenon where non-native species that lack close relatives in their new environment tend to be more successful in invading and establishing populations, potentially due to reduced competition with native herbivores.", "The tendency for non-native plant species to have a more successful invasion when they lack close evolutionary relationships to native plant species, likely due to reduced herbivory pressure."], "phylogenetic similarity": ["The degree of relatedness between non-native species and native species, which can influence the degree of herbivory they experience, is measured by the similarity in their evolutionary histories, family ties, or proximity to closely related species.", "The degree to which an organism's evolutionary relationship with other organisms in its environment influences its likelihood of suffering herbivory and its potential to outcompete native species for resources.", "The closeness of a non-indigenous species' evolutionary history to that of native species, influencing its susceptibility to herbivory and potentially affecting its invasive capabilities.", "The degree to which a non-native plant shares a history of evolutionary relationships with native plants, which can influence the likelihood of encountering similar herbivores and subsequently experiencing reduced herbivory damage.", "The degree to which a non-native species' ancestral history mirrors that of native species, potentially influencing the interactions it experiences with herbivores and its likelihood of successful invasion."], "phylogenetic overdispersion": ["The phenomenon where the distribution of related non-native plant species exhibits a pattern of scattered and uneven susceptibility to herbivory, with distant relatives experiencing relatively lower levels of damage, potentially leading to a skewed outcome in terms of invasive success and native community resistance.", "The tendency for non-native species that lack close evolutionary connections to native species to thrive in a new environment by avoiding shared herbivore pressures, ultimately leading to more successful colonization and potential invasion.", "The tendency for organisms that are less closely related to their native counterparts to experience less harm from herbivores, resulting in a hypothetical increase in their ability to establish invasive populations.", "The phenomenon by which the presence of non-native plant species with distant evolutionary relationships to native species in a community leads to a decrease in herbivory, potentially resulting in increased invasiveness and reduced resistance to invasion, while species with closer evolutionary ties may experience greater herbivory and reduced invasive potential.", "The phenomenon where species that are evolutionary outliers in a community, sharing few or no close relatives, tend to have reduced susceptibility to herbivory and other biotic interactions, allowing them to more readily establish and thrive in novel environments."], "plant-insect interactions": ["The complex and dynamic relationships between non-native plant species and their insect cohabitants, influenced by evolutionary histories and phylogenetic distances, where the sharing of herbivores between closely related species can shape the likelihood of invasion and community resistance.", "The complex relationships between non-native plant species and their insect consumers, which can affect the plant's ability to establish itself in a new environment and potentially lead to changes in the local ecosystem.", "The intricate web of relationships between foreign plant species and native insects that affect the growth and survival of both parties, with the extent of these interactions potentially influenced by the phylogenetic distance between the plant and its closest native relatives.", "The intricate dance of mutual influence between species of non-human organisms that grow in the same ecological context, where organisms from distinct evolutionary lineages may exhibit varying degrees of compatibility, tolerance, or vulnerability towards one another.", "The complex and dynamic relationships between novel, non-native plant species and the insect populations that interact with them, influencing the plant's ability to establish and thrive in a new environment."], "naturalization hypothesis": ["The idea that the evolutionary relationships between non-native species and native species in a new environment can influence the ability of the non-native species to establish themselves and thrive.", "The idea that the probability of a non-native plant species establishing itself in a new environment is influenced by the evolutionary relationship it shares with native species, with those that lack close relatives having a greater likelihood of success.", "The idea that non-native species are more likely to establish themselves in a new environment if they lack close evolutionary relatives in that environment, thereby reducing competition and predation pressure.", "The idea that a non-native organism's ability to establish a self-sustaining population in a new environment is influenced by its evolutionary relationship with native species, with those that lack close relatives in their new range having a greater likelihood of successfully invading and thriving.", "The notion that the evolutionary proximity of an invasive species to native flora or fauna influences its capacity to establish a foothold in a new environment, with species lacking close relatives potentially being more successful in their colonization efforts due to reduced susceptibility to shared herbivory pressures."]}
