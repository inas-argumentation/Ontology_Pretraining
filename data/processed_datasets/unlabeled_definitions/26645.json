region, but is not a key factor in its overall invasiveness.", "The physical attribute of a plant that represents its ability to capture light and compete with other vegetation, while also being a fundamental characteristic used to distinguish between species, influencing the plant's overall ecological performance and potential for success in novel environments.", "The linear dimension of a
