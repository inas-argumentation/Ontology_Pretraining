habitat for various forms of life and is often targeted for human economic and ecological exploitation.", "The measure of the spatial distribution of land cover dominated by plant life, often

trade": ["The regular and widespread exchange of goods, often involving the transportation of biological specimens, between diverse geographical locations across the world, facilitated by economic and cultural connections.", "The intentional or unintentional movement of goods, services, or organisms across international boundaries, driven by economic, cultural, or ecological factors, which has the potential to significantly influence the distribution and spread of species, both intentionally introduced and unintentionally accompanying other commodities, and thereby shaping the global ecological landscape.", "The movement of goods and commodities across geographical boundaries, facilitated by human activity, that can lead to the unintentional transportation of non-native species and
