composition and distribution."], "null model": ["A hypothetical framework that establishes a baseline for understanding the distribution and abundance of organisms across different spatial scales, by assuming that they respond similarly to environmental and ecological processes, and testing this assumption against observed patterns in diversity.", "A statistical framework that assumes no inherent differences or patterns in species distribution or abundance, instead positing that these phenomena can be explained by general processes and patterns operating at large spatial scales, such as the influence of geography on the richness of plant diversity.", "A conceptual framework that hypothesizes a fundamental absence of relationship between two or more variables, allowing researchers to test whether observed patterns are driven by inherent processes or other extraneous factors.", "A statistical construct that hypothesizes a neutral or random relationship between variables, providing a baseline against which the strength and patterns of actual relationships can be assessed and compared, as it is often used in ecology to test whether patterns observed in native and exotic species are significantly different from those expected by chance alone.", "A statistical approach that examines the underlying patterns of ecological data without assuming a specific relationship between variables, often serving as a baseline for comparison to test the validity of hypotheses regarding the interactions between species and their environment."], "spatial scale": ["The range within which patterns of biological variation are shaped by the reciprocal interactions between the physical environment and organisms, resulting in the formation of distinct assemblages that can be compared across different extents.", "The range or extent within which the patterns and processes governing the abundance and distribution of organisms are relatively consistent and influenced by similar ecological factors, often resulting in parallel relationships between different types of species.", "The extent of landscape or habitat over which environmental factors, ecological processes, or
