which species coexist and contribute to the ecosystem's complexity, often used to evaluate and compare the ecological richness of various land-use practices.", "A measure of the richness and heterogeneity of a collection of elements, revealing the variations in the assemblage of species, where a lack of incentive to preserve endemic organisms might lead to an increase in non-native components, ultimately affecting the ecological integrity of the entire system.", "A quantitative measure that captures the complexity and richness of an ecosystem's tree composition, often used to compare the uniqueness and adaptability of different habitats, where a high score suggests a greater variety of species and a more resilient ecological balance.", "A statistical measurement used to quantify the relative abundance of distinct elements within a complex system, providing insights into the extent of representation and uniformity of its constituents, thereby facilitating comparisons between different ecosystems and management practices."], "tree diversity": ["The variety of unique and coexisting species of arboreal flora in an ecological system, encompassing both native and non-native populations, that contribute to the overall complexity and adaptability of the environment.", "The range and variety of unique woody elements within a given area, reflecting the mix of
