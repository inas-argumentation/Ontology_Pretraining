global change.", "A population of plants that is in a state of vulnerability due to the disruption of key ecological interactions, such as mutualisms with seed-dispersing species, and is consequently susceptible to declining distribution and survival, thereby compromising its ability to adapt to environmental changes.", "Populations of plants whose presence is tenuous and vulnerable to decline, often as a result of disruptions in their ecological relationships and sensitivity to environmental changes, making them prone to extirpation and conservation concern.", "Species of rare and declining vegetation communities that are heavily reliant on specific ecological interactions, such as seed dispersal mutualisms, to persist in the face of environmental changes and habitat alterations, and whose conservation requires a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships within these communities."], "cneorum tricocon": ["A rare and endangered Mediterranean shrub whose survival relies heavily on a symbiotic relationship with its only seed disperser, and is therefore vulnerable to disruption in this mutualism, which has significant implications for its population dynamics and distribution.", "A rare, threatened plant species that exemplifies the intricate dance between climate, habitat, and mutualistic relationships, and highlights the need for a delicate balance between natural processes and human intervention to ensure its survival.", "A rare, relictual species of plant that is often found in declining populations, whose distribution and survival are influenced by a complex interplay of climate, habitat, and mutualistic relationships with its primary seed disperser, making it a sentinel species for understanding the impacts of global change on plant populations.", "A rare and endangered plant species, whose survival is intricately linked to the presence of its sole seed-dispersing partner, and whose distribution is significantly influenced by both climatic and non-climatic factors.", "A critically endangered, long-lost species that has adapted to thrive in close symbiosis with a specific seed-dispersing partner, its survival now threatened by the disruption of this mutualistic relationship and the influence of climate and habitat changes."], "daphne rotriguezii": ["A rare and resilient botanical relic, often found in specific microhabitats, that has adapted to thrive under conditions of diminished seed dispersal, where a particular mutualistic relationship has been disrupted, yet still relies on subtle cues from its environment to survive in a fragile balance with its ecosystem.", "A relic species of plant that once thrived in a specific ecosystem, now struggling to survive due to disruptions in its relationships with other species, including those involved in seed dispersal.", "A type of endangered plant species that, when paired with its native ecological counterpart, thrives in specific environmental conditions, but faces uncertain survival when this relationship is disrupted by external factors.", "A type of rare and vulnerable plant that thrives in specific habitat conditions and relies on a single, specialized seed-dispersal mechanism to ensure its survival and distribution.", "A type of relict plant species, often found in restricted habitats, that has a unique dependence on a specific mutualistic relationship with a seed disperser, and its decline can be attributed to disruptions in this relationship as well as environmental factors."], "mutualism disruption": ["The loss or alteration of a crucial ecological interaction between a species and its essential partner, resulting in reduced reproduction and survival chances of the affected species, often caused by environmental changes, human activities, or invasive species, and subsequently contributing to a decline in population numbers and potentially even extinction.", "A situation in which the breakdown of a long-standing and ecologically crucial partnership between two species, often driven by environmental pressures or human activities, can lead to unintended consequences for the persistence and distribution of the affected species, ultimately threatening the health and resilience of ecosystems.", "The disruption of an intimate ecological relationship between a plant species and its primary seed disperser, resulting in altered population dynamics, distribution, and potentially reduced fitness, often caused by the introduction of an invasive or competing species that disrupts the original co-evolved mechanism of seed dispersal.", "The breakdown of a critical ecological relationship between two species, typically characterized by the loss of a key service or benefit provided by one species to the other, leading to changes in population dynamics, habitat use, and distribution.", "A disruption in the ecological partnership between species that has led to a breakdown in the usual patterns of interaction, thereby altering the fundamental dynamics of a ecosystem, potentially leading to the decline or extinction of one or more species."], "alien invasive species": ["A non-native species that disrupts a delicate balance in an ecosystem by substituting its presence in a key ecological role, often replacing the native species' natural seed disperser, leading to changes in habitat selection and potentially altering the survival prospects of a previously declining relict plant species.", "A non-native organism that has established itself in a new ecosystem, often to the detriment of native species and their delicate interactions, which can lead to significant changes in the composition and functioning of the ecosystem.", "A non-native organism that significantly alters the ecosystem dynamics, often by disrupting ancient and crucial relationships, thereby exacerbating the decline of relict plant species that depend on these interactions for their survival and reproduction.", "A non-native species that has been introduced to an ecosystem through human activity or natural dispersal, which, as a result of environmental factors and disruptions to natural interactions, begins to thrive in its new habitat, outcompeting native species and potentially threatening the long-term survival of relict plant populations, as seen in the study of Daphne rodriguezii and Cneorum tricoccon.", "A non-native species that usurps the ecological role of a native partner in a mutualism, often replacing it and altering the habitat selection patterns of its former partner, thereby influencing the distribution and survival of the dependent species."], "habitat selection": ["The process by which organisms choose and occupy areas within their environment that provide them with optimal conditions for survival and reproduction, taking into account factors such as climate, vegetation, and interactions with other species, ultimately influencing their distribution and persistence.", "The process by which species adaptively allocate themselves to areas with optimal environmental conditions, which in turn affect their demographic rates, such as survival and reproduction, and ultimately determine their distribution and abundance at a landscape scale.", "The process by which organisms adaptively choose and occupy specific environmental niches or areas that optimize their survival, growth, and reproduction, influenced by a complex interplay of abiotic and biotic factors, including the presence or absence of mutualistic partners.", "The
