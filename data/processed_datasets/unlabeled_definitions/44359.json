excel in competitive interactions, and those that tolerate stressful conditions.", "A conceptual framework that describes the diverse ways in which plants adapt to their environment, encompassing

deliberate versus accidental introduction of non-native plant species can be understood as a dichotomy between planned and unplanned human-mediated dispersals, where the former involves intentional

modification.", "The intentional and unintentional introduction of non-native species into an environment, where the latter often occurs through natural dispersal processes, human activities, or a combination of both, potentially shaping the species' adaptive strategies and its likelihood of successful invasion.", "The process by which non-native species are intentionally or unintentionally brought into a new environment, often influenced by factors such as human activity, trade, and environmental changes, which can ultimately shape their ability to naturalize and potentially become

quickly occupy newly available niches, often at the expense of their own durability and long-term persistence.", "Species that thrive in ephemeral or disturbed environments, often utilizing rapid growth and resource consumption to outcompete native plants, and are more likely to colonize new areas through accidental introductions rather than deliberate release.", "Plants that thrive in environments with fluctuating or unpredictable conditions, often relying on rapid growth and prolific seed production to colonize newly disturbed or cleared areas, tend to dominate early stages of plant colonization, such as post-disturbance sites or areas with unstable soil.", "Plants that thrive in disturbed or rapidly changing environments, often taking advantage of open niches and
