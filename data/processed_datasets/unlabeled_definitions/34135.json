{"introduction event": ["The initial dispersal of a non-native population into a new territory, typically resulting from human activity such as trade, travel, or intentional or accidental release, which sets in motion the potential establishment and spread of the population in the new environment.", "The point of arrival of a group of individuals from a foreign population into a new environment, triggered by a specific human activity or natural process, which can set in motion the potential establishment of a non-native species.", "The singular instance of human activity that intentionally or unintentionally brings a non-native species into a new environment, often involving a specific quantity of individuals, and having a potential impact on the native ecosystem.", "The point at which an invasive species' reproductive material, such as eggs, seeds, or insects, enters a new environment, potentially marking the beginning of a novel population.", "The occurrence of a singular instance of non-native species dispersal, resulting in the potential establishment of a new population, which is influenced by various factors such as the number of individuals introduced and the environmental context in which it occurs."], "lineage survival probability": ["The likelihood that a founding individual of a non-native species will establish a self-sustaining population, thereby contributing to the regional alien species pool.", "The likelihood that a newly introduced individual or group of individuals will establish a self-sustaining population, ultimately leading to the formation of a distinct lineage or genetic lineage.", "The probability that a single individual or group of individuals, introduced to a new environment, will successfully establish a self-sustaining population over time, despite potential challenges and uncertainties posed by its new surroundings.", "The probability that a founding individual from an introduced species is able to establish a stable population that can persist over time and adapt to the environment, ultimately contributing to the long-term survival and potential success of the species in its new habitat.", "The likelihood that a founding individual in an introduced population successfully adapts and thrives, thereby perpetuating its genetic legacy through subsequent generations."], "colonization pressure": ["The cumulative number of biological entities or introductions made into a specific environment, which subsequently affects the likelihood of successful establishment and persistence of introduced species, thereby impacting the overall diversity of non-native species present.", "The cumulative effect of species introductions and individual representation on the likelihood of establishing a new, self-sustaining population in a given region.", "The cumulative influence of repeated and varied introductions of non-native organisms to an environment, which can ultimately lead to an increase in the number of established alien species.", "The cumulative force exerted by the introduction of non-native organisms, reflecting the combination of frequency and abundance of invasions, which can ultimately shape the composition and diversity of native communities.", "The cumulative force exerted by human activities, such as global trade, travel, and habitat destruction, on the likelihood of non-native species establishing populations in a given area."], "alien species richness": ["The cumulative total of non-native species that have successfully established populations in a particular region or ecosystem, influenced by a complex interplay of factors including the likelihood of species introduction, the adaptability of founders, and the ecological context in which they are introduced.", "The cumulative diversity of non-native organisms that have successfully established and persisted in a particular region or environment, influenced by factors such as the number of initial introductions, the likelihood of individual species' survival and reproduction, and the stability or variability of the environmental conditions.", "The variety of non-native populations that thrive in a region, which is shaped by the number of initial introductions, the likelihood of successful colonization, and the stability of the environmental conditions.", "The measure of diversity of non-native organisms thriving in a particular area, reflecting the cumulative result of multiple introduction events and individual settlement successes.", "The cumulative total of non-native populations thriving in a particular area, resulting from the complex interplay of factors including the number of species introduced, the likelihood of each species establishing itself, and the environmental conditions that affect the persistence of these populations."], "probability of establishment": ["The likelihood that a introduced organism will not only survive initial introduction, but also successfully establish a self-sustaining population in its new environment, dependent on factors such as the initial number of individuals, environmental variability, and the probability of a founding individual leaving a surviving lineage.", "The likelihood that an introduced individual will successfully form a sustainable population, given the environmental conditions and external factors influencing its ability to thrive and reproduce.", "The likelihood that a newly introduced species, brought into a given environment through a set of introduction events, is able to successfully adapt and reproduce, thereby contributing to the growth of its population and potentially leading to the establishment of a sustainable and thriving lineage.", "The likelihood that a newly introduced species will successfully colonize and thrive in its new environment, influenced by factors such as the quantity of initial individuals, the frequency and consistency of introduction events, and the adaptability of the species to varied conditions.", "The likelihood that a newly introduced population will successfully establish a reproducing lineage in a new environment, dependent on various ecological and biotic factors such as the number of founding individuals, environmental variability, and competition from native species."]}
