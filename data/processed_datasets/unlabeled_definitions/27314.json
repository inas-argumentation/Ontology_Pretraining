ability to inhibit the growth and spread of invasive plant species while leaving native flora relatively unaffected.", "A group of organisms that produce spores in specialized structures, characterized by their ability to form close relationships with plant species, often exhibiting pathogenic tendencies towards non-native invasive weeds, and demonstrating a preference for colonizing and manipulating the soil environment in which they thrive.", "A genus of fungi capable of harnessing their pathogenic properties to effectively suppress the growth and spread of non-native plant invaders, while exhibiting selective tolerance towards native species and delicate ecosystems.", "A group of organisms that possess the unique ability to thrive in a wide range of ecosystems, often serving as a counterbalance to invasive species, and have been shown to be effective in controlling the growth and spread of problematic weeds through the development of diseases that cause significant damage to the affected plants."], "old world climming fern": ["A highly invasive and destructive weed native to Asia, which has been accidentally introduced to southern Florida, where it has outcompeted native species and threatens the delicate ecosystem.", "A tropical vine native to Asia, now wreaking havoc on delicate ecosystems in southern Florida, threatening the balance of native
