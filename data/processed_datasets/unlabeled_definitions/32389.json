{"drought mortality": ["The permanent removal of woody plants from the landscape as a result of chronic water scarcity, where the plant's ability to adapt to or compensate for dry conditions is overwhelmed, often leading to the disruption of ecosystem functions and potential collapse of the terrestrial carbon sink.", "The phenomenon where arid conditions surpass the adaptability and resilience of woody plant populations, resulting in widespread die-off of individual plants, often observed at the peripheries of their natural ranges.", "The sudden and widespread death of vegetation in arid or semi-arid regions due to prolonged water scarcity, exceeding the natural resilience and adaptations of individual plant species.", "The sudden and widespread death of trees or woody vegetation in areas with limited water availability, often triggered by environmental stress and exceeding the natural adaptive capabilities of the plants.", "The sudden and widespread decline or loss

can be found, extending from the boundaries where their presence is marginal to the core areas where they thrive, marking the transition zone where environmental stresses and adaptations converge to shape their distribution and survival.", "The geographic boundaries within which the most sensitive and vulnerable populations of a particular type of tree are typically found, often experiencing frequent and severe water scarcity.", "The geographical boundaries where a specific type of vegetation becomes increasingly sparse or disappears, marking the intersection of its tolerance for arid conditions and the prevailing climate, resulting in a high likelihood of mortality.", "The geographic boundaries beyond which an organism's physiological adaptations to cope with arid conditions are no longer sufficient to ensure its survival, marking the transition from areas where it thrives to areas where it is increasingly vulnerable to extinction.", "The specific area where a group of plants, distinguished by their unique physiological and ecological characteristics, coexist and interact with their environment, often exhibiting a dynamic boundary that is influenced by factors such as climate, soil, and water availability."], "physiological tolerance": ["The ability of a plant species to maintain a delicate balance between water loss and intake, allowing it to withstand stressful conditions, but only up to a certain point, beyond which it becomes vulnerable to widespread mortality.", "The ability of an organism's internal systems to absorb and respond to extreme environmental pressures without sustaining irreversible damage, allowing it to persist in a challenging environment despite adversity.", "The ability of an organism to maintain optimal functioning and adapt to environmental pressures by modulating its internal physiological processes, allowing it to operate within a range of conditions without compromising its survival and growth.", "The ability of a plant population to maintain its physiological functions, such as water transport and nutrient uptake, within a range of environmental conditions that exceed its natural boundaries, thereby allowing it to adapt to changing climate conditions.", "The inherent ability of an organism to withstand and recover from environmental pressures, such as extreme water scarcity, by maintaining a delicate balance within its biological systems, allowing it to thrive in conditions where others might struggle or perish."], "tree species": ["A collective grouping of woody organisms characterized by shared physiological and ecological adaptations, often exhibiting distinct traits and responses to environmental stressors, which together enable them to occupy specific niches and habitats.", "A type of perennial plant that is a dominant member of its ecosystem, characterized by its capacity to absorb and store carbon, with variations in physiological responses and adaptations to its environment that affect its susceptibility to drought-induced mortality.", "A group of plants characterized by their ability to grow in a similar ecological niche, exhibiting distinct physiological and ecological traits that influence their tolerance and resilience to environmental stressors, such as drought, and often forming distinct boundaries or \"edges\" in their distribution.", "A plant characterized by a specific arrangement of stems and leaves, often possessing adaptations that enable it to thrive in a range of environments, yet vulnerable to catastrophic failures when exposed to prolonged and severe water scarcity, resulting in widespread mortality.", "A group of plant individuals that exhibit shared physiological characteristics and ecological adaptations, with specific traits governing their tolerance to environmental stressors, such as aridity, and exhibiting varying degrees of vulnerability to mortality in response to climate change."], "tree mortality": ["The cessation of a tree's physiological functions and death of the organism due to extreme environmental conditions, such as prolonged drought, that surpass the tree's adaptive capabilities and physiological tolerance thresholds.", "The cessation of growth and function of woody plants, often triggered by environmental stresses, such as drought, which can have far-reaching ecological and societal consequences.", "The process by which plants in arid or semi-arid environments undergo a significant decline in health and ultimately fail to thrive, resulting in the loss of individual plants and potentially having far-reaching consequences for ecosystem function and overall ecological resilience.", "The irreversible cessation of growth and function of vegetation, typically occurring in response to extreme environmental conditions, resulting in the premature demise of plants that once thrived in a particular ecosystem.", "The premature cessation of a plant's reproductive cycle and structural growth,
