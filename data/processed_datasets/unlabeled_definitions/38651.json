defined area where the river flows, characterized by a specific shape and width, and which plays a significant role in the invasion of non-native species, such as Siberian elm, by influencing the movement and spread of trees along its course.", "A natural or modified passage of water that serves as a conduit for the flow of a river, influencing the surrounding landscape and ecosystem, and is often characterized by a varying degree of restriction and modification by human activities."], "river geomorphology": ["The configuration and structural characteristics of a watercourse's bed and banks, including the interplay between natural and human-induced factors that shape the landscape, influence the formation of riparian habitats, and affect the spread of vegetation and other organisms along its margins.", "The study of the shapes and structures that arise from the interaction of a river's natural forces with its surroundings, including the impact of human activities on its course and banks.", "The study of the spatial patterns and processes that shape the natural and human-altered landscape of a river's surroundings, including the complex interactions between the river's flow, sediment transport, and surrounding topography, as well as the impacts of human activities on the river's form and functioning.", "The arrangement and structural features of a watercourse's natural

zones.", "The study of the shape and form of the land adjacent to a body of water, encompassing factors such as the confluence of human activity and natural processes that influence the character and dynamics of the riparian zone, including channel and floodplain restriction, which in turn impact the likelihood of invasion by non-native species."], "south platte river": ["A meandering waterway that serves as a lifeline for riparian ecosystems, traversing a landscape of contrasting uses where urbanization and agriculture coexist with nature, yet also vulnerable to the unintended consequences
