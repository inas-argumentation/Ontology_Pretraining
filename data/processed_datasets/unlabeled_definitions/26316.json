pervasive invasive species known for its capacity to displace native invertebrates, particularly ants, and alter the ecological balance of urban and natural ecosystems.", "A highly invasive and ecologically disruptive insect species, notorious for its ability to outcompete and displace native ants and other invertebrates, ultimately leading to significant changes in community composition and ecosystem processes.", "A highly competitive and aggressive species of ant that has a global distribution and is notorious for its ability to displace native ant populations, leading to ecological disruptions and declines in biodiversity.", "A species of ant notorious for its global spread and displacement of native ants, having a significant impact on urban ecosystems by altering the
