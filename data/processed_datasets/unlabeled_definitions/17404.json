in response to environmental stressors and physiological constraints, but still vulnerable to limitations in calcium availability, which may hinder its expansion into new territories.", "A type of freshwater crustacean that thrives in environments with moderate levels of calcium, requiring a delicate balance between physiological well-being and anti-predator strategies, and may struggle to adapt to areas with limited calcium availability.", "A freshwater crustacean species known for its remarkable ability to adapt to environments with reduced levels of a vital mineral, compensating for its physiological limitations by altering its behavior and potentially leading to changes in its population dynamics and geographical distribution."], "predation risk": ["The threat to an organism's
