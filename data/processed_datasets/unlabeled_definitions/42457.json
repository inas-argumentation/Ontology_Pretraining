leading to reduced disturbance and stress.", "Regions with a lesser presence of alien plant species, characterized by fluctuating environmental conditions, distant from areas of high human disturbance and waterfronts, where the specific adaptations of the species are not optimally matched to the local climate, resulting in a lower overall density of invasive plants.", "Areas where the presence of invasive alien plant species is significantly less frequent, characterized by relatively low environmental disturbance, limited human impact, and stable temperature and precipitation patterns.", "Areas where the abundance of invasive alien plant species is significantly lower due to a combination of environmental factors, such as moderate temperature fluctuations, seasonal precipitation patterns, and lower levels of anthropogenic disturbance, which create a less favorable environment for their establishment and growth.", "Areas where the frequency of invasive plant species is significantly lower than in other regions, typically characterized by moderate to high environmental stressors, such as varying temperatures and precipitation patterns, and fewer human disturbance factors."], "hierarchical model of species communities": ["A conceptual framework that categorizes and connects different components of an ecological system, such as species, habitats, and
