resources in its environment, which is shaped by a complex interplay of physical and biological factors, including the condition of the surrounding habitat, the presence and influence of conspecifics

"dominance": ["The ability of an individual to consistently occupy a favorable foraging position, thereby gaining a advantageous feeding opportunity, and being less likely to be displaced by other individuals.", "The ability of a fish to consistently occupy and maintain a preferred feeding position, often accompanied by increased aggressive behavior, especially in the presence of similar-sized conspecifics and heterospecifics, and is influenced by factors such as turbidity, velocity, and intraspecific competition.", "The state in which an individual fish tends to occupy and prioritize a specific foraging position, gaining access to more profitable food sources and displaying increased confidence in its environment, often as a result of its size, competitive advantage, or social
