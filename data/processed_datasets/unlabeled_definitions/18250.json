dispersal patterns, relying on individual differences in migratory behavior and environmental factors, such as geographical complexity, to expand its range and occupy new habitats."], "tag-recapture study": ["A research method that involves attaching unique identifiers to individuals within a population and subsequently monitoring their movements and recaptures in their natural environment, allowing for the investigation of factors influencing their dispersal patterns, including size, sex, region, and density, while accounting for external factors like fishing effort.", "A research approach that involves monitoring the movements and dispersal patterns of a species by releasing individuals with unique identifiers and subsequently recapturing them to gather information on their migration routes, population dynamics, and habitat use, with the goal of understanding the effects of various factors on an species' dispersal and distribution.", "A research methodology that involves fitting individual organisms with permanent identification markers and subsequently monitoring their movements and migrations over time, providing valuable insights into population dynamics and spatial distribution patterns.", "A research method involving the deployment of small, identifying markers on a specific population of animals, followed by the observation and collection of those marked animals at a later time and place, allowing researchers to track individual movements, migration patterns, and dispersal rates across different environments and populations.", "A study in which individuals are fitted with a tracking device that allows researchers to monitor their movement patterns, and their subsequent recapture provides valuable insights into the dispersal behavior, migration routes, and population dynamics of the species under investigation, thereby shedding light on the complex interactions between ecological factors and the range expansion of non-native species."], "norway": ["A vast coastal expanse where the unpredictable tides of a vast northern ocean meet the rugged silhouettes of fjords, where the migratory paths of a curious crustacean unfold in

fusion of Arctic and Scandinavian influences, where the boundaries between sea and land blur, and the rhythms of oceanic life unfold, punctuated by the migratory patterns of a distinctive crustacean species.", "A vast, fjord-carved coastline along which a species of king crab, notorious for its ability to migrate far and wide, has found its way through human introduction, with its movements influenced by a complex interplay of factors including region, density, and individual variation."], "logistic regression": ["A statistical technique that allows researchers to explore the relationship between various factors and a binary outcome, such as the probability of dispersal, by modeling the odds of an event occurring based on specific characteristics, such as sex, size, region, and density.", "A statistical method used to analyze the relationship between a categorical outcome and one or more predictor variables, allowing researchers to identify the independent variables that significantly influence the probability of an event occurring, such as the likelihood of a certain species dispersing to a new region, while accounting for other factors that might affect this probability, like individual characteristics, spatial location, and environmental conditions.", "A statistical method used to analyze the likelihood of a specific outcome or event, often
