co-evolved with the local environment over a significant period, potentially playing crucial ecological roles and maintaining a delicate balance with other species in the aquatic ecosystem.", "Species

caused by the presence of non-native fish species that outcompete them for resources and habitat.", "Species of fish indigenous to the rivers of Hokkaido, Japan, that have evolved to thrive in their specific aquatic environments, but are vulnerable to competition and displacement by non-native fish species that have been introduced to the region.", "Species of salmon that are naturally occurring

measurement of a body of flowing water's breadth from one riverbank to the other, where changes in this dimension can affect the habitat and distribution of its aquatic inhabitants.", "The span of the watercourse's channel, measuring the distance from one bank to the other, which may influence the ecological dynamics between native salmonids and introduced rainbow trout in certain regions.", "The measurement of the maximum distance between the opposite banks of a watercourse, which plays a crucial role in determining the habitat and spatial distribution of aquatic species, including fish, and can have a significant impact on the dynamics of introduced and native populations.", "The measurement of the watercourse's lateral extent, typically considered a critical factor in the distribution and abundance of aquatic species, as its influence on the flow dynamics, habitat structure, and competition for resources is significant.", "The distance between the outermost reaches of a watercourse's banks, which is a crucial factor in determining the habitat and abundance of aquatic species, particularly in determining the threshold at which non-native fish species like trout can outcompete native salmonids."], "distance from the sea": ["The proximity of a river's mouth to the shoreline, indicating the extent to which it is influenced by marine influences and interactions with the coastal environment.", "The closeness or proximity to the point where freshwater flows into the ocean, affecting the habitat characteristics and influences of a river's ecosystem, which can impact the distribution and population density of aquatic species.", "The proximity to the point where a river's freshwater flow meets the saltwater of the ocean, which can impact the river's ecological characteristics and the distribution of aquatic species.", "The spatial relation of a river's origin to its outlet, encompassing the landward and seaward gradients that influence aquatic life, referring to the variable that plays a neutral role in determining the density of a non-native trout species.", "The proximity to the ocean's influence, which can affect the characteristics of a river, including its aquatic life, water quality, and ecosystem stability."], "rainbow trout": ["A highly adaptable and invasive fish species, originally native to North America, known for its voracious appetite and ability to thrive in various freshwater environments, which can significantly impact local aquatic ecosystems and potentially displace native species.", "A species of fish known for its vibrant coloration and ability to thrive in varied aquatic environments, which has gained a significant presence in certain regions of Hokkaido, Japan, posing a notable threat to native salmonid populations.", "A species of fish known for its propensity to spread rapidly and displace native populations, characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of aquatic environments and adapt to new habitats with relative ease, often becoming the dominant species in unconfined rivers.", "A vibrant, adaptable fish species introduced to eastern Asian waters, known for its rapid colonization of unconfined rivers and dominance over native fish populations, potentially altering the ecological balance and driving decline in salmonid densities over time.", "A certain species of freshwater fish, characterized by its vibrant coloration and tendency to rapidly colonize new habitats, often leading to a decline in the population of native species it shares its ecosystem with."],
