necessary nutrients and immunological defenses from its mother, while also minimizing the risk of transmission of pathogens from maternal to fetal blood, and is influenced by a complex interplay

characterized by varying degrees of invasion or non-invasion of maternal tissues.", "The process by which a developing fetus embeds itself in the maternal bloodstream, while maintaining a layer of
