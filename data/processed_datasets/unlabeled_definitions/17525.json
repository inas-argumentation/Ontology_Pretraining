{"stepping stone expansion": ["A dispersal process in which a single genetic source population migrates through multiple intermediate points or \"waystations\" before ultimately reaching a distant location, resulting in a characteristic genetic signature of reduced genetic variation and lack of admixture in the introduced populations.", "The process by which a non-native species gradually

indicating a narrow founding event and a potential for long-term population isolation.", "The process by which a non-native species spreads to new areas through a series of intermediate, isolated populations, which act as conduits for genetic material to flow from the original introduction site to downstream locations, potentially resulting in a gradual increase in genetic diversity.", "The process by which a non-native species gradually colonizes new geographic areas through a series of small, isolated introductions, each facilitated by the presence of the species in nearby locations, ultimately giving rise to distinct populations that are genetically similar to one another.", "A process of colonization where a single introduction of a non-native species into a new region gives rise to subsequent introductions, often through a series of intermediate steps, leading to the establishment of populations that share a genetic legacy from the original introduction, but with

characterized by the transfer of DNA from a native population to a non-native population through a series of geographically intermediate locations, ultimately resulting in a loss of genetic diversity in the introduced population.", "A gateway or bridge for the spread of genetic diversity, where a small yet significant influx of unique characteristics is introduced, leading to a subsequent expansion or diffusion of species into new regions, with the likelihood of diminished genetic variation in established populations.", "A pathway of introduction, characterized by a gradual and sequential spread of individuals from a single, limited original source to multiple isolated destinations, resulting in a lack of genetic variation in the introduced populations.", "A conduit for genetic waves, traversing a range, facilitating the gradual spread of a species across new territories, leaving a trail of reduced variability in its wake."], "caribbean": ["A region of tropical

islands and coastlines where non-native species may hitch a ride on maritime trade routes, carrying with them the genetic signature of their ancestral homelands.", "A region characterized by a rich marine biodiversity, where the genetic history of introduced species is often revealed through the pattern of stepping stone expansion, with the likelihood of reduced genetic variation and a lack of admixture in established populations.", "A region where the gentle lapping of ocean waves against a multitude of tropical isles has given rise to a complex tapestry of genetic patterns, woven from the threads of historical introductions and ancient lineages, where the whispers of a distant homeland still linger in the mitochondrial DNA of its inhabitants."], "florida": ["A region characterized by a narrow genetic pool, with populations often exhibiting a stepping-stone pattern of introduction from a single source, resulting in a diminished variation profile compared to its native counterparts, yet still harboring a distinct signature of origin.", "A region where non-native species, after a small initial introduction, have had sufficient time to expand and spread, yet still retain limited genetic variation and distinct characteristics from their native origins, often due to a chain of sequential introductions.", "A region where the genetic trail of a non-native species converges, potentially hiding the secrets of its initial introduction and population dynamics, with an underlying pattern of stepping stones leading to a gradual spread of its influence.", "A coastal region where the presence of non-native species is often characterized by a limited genetic diversity, indicating a possible stepping-stone expansion from a single introduction, with the potential for further dispersal to other areas.", "A landmass known for its warm waters, hosting a delicate balance of aquatic life, where genetic fingerprints reveal the secrets of invasion routes and the echoes of a single, ancient introduction."], "perna viridis": ["A saltwater mollusk known for its widespread and complex introduction patterns, often exhibiting a \"stepping stone\" expansion from its native
