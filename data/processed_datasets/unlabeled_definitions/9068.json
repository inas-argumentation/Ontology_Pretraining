{"niche-based models": ["A framework that leverages environmental factors to simulate and forecast the spread of non-native species by identifying the areas where they are most likely to thrive, essentially projecting the extent of their potential domain based on climatic, geographic, and landscape characteristics.", "The use of environmental factors and data on a species' current distribution to predict the areas where the species is most likely to thrive, thus projecting its potential range of expansion.", "A method of estimating the environmental suitability of a species by using a combination of relevant factors, such as climate, geography, and landscape features, to predict the areas where it is most likely to thrive, allowing for a deeper understanding of its potential range and distribution.", "A methodological approach that leverages correlations between environmental factors and the spatial distribution of a species to predict the areas where a given organism is most likely to thrive, based on its current adaptation and growth habits.", "A method of estimating the ecological preferences and potential spread of non-native species by analyzing the correlations between their current distribution and various environmental factors, allowing for the prediction of areas where they may thrive and spread further in the future, and thereby informing effective management and control strategies for preventing their overextension."], "distribution range": ["The geographical area where a species is currently able to survive and thrive, based on its adaptability to environmental factors such as climate, geography, and landscape, within which its population can disperse and expand over time.", "The area within which an organism is naturally or artificially present, and where its ability to thrive is influenced by factors such as climate, geography, and landscape, encompassing both its actual habitat and the broader territory it may potentially occupy.", "The area within a region where a specific organism has the optimal conditions to thrive and sustain its presence, reflecting its ability to adapt and spread.", "The extent of a species' environmental suitability, encompassing both the areas where it is currently found and those where it has the potential to thrive based on its adaptability to various conditions, but has not yet been established.", "The area within which a particular species has the ability to thrive and spread, as defined by its adaptability to environmental conditions, geographic barriers, and competition with other species, which provides a framework for understanding its current and potential spread."], "minimum residence time": ["The time period during which an invasive species persists and establishes itself in a particular region, ultimately determining its capacity to expand its territorial reach.", "The amount of time a species requires to adapt and establish a foothold in a new environment before it begins to spread and occupy a larger proportion of its viable habitat.", "The time period during which a species has had the opportunity to establish a foothold in a given area, allowing it to gradually expand its territory before encountering any resistance to further spread.", "The length of time a species requires to settle and become established in an area before it can spread and occupy a larger portion of its suitable habitat.", "The minimum period of time required for an invasive species to gradually spread and adapt to a region, ultimately leading to its expansion into suitable areas, and eventually reaching the full extent of its ecological niche."], "potential distribution": ["The theoretical spatial extent of a species' suitability for establishment and expansion, encompassing areas where environmental conditions align with its physiological and ecological needs, indicating the maximum area it is likely to occupy if unhindered by biological, physical, or anthropogenic barriers.", "The zone that a non-native species is ecologically adapted to inhabit, based on its environmental tolerance and ability to thrive, considering factors such as climate, topography, and landscape characteristics.", "The theoretical range within which an invasive species is likely to establish itself and thrive, taking into account environmental factors and the species' ecological adaptations, but which may not yet be fully realized in terms of actual distribution.", "The area within a region that a species is theoretically capable of occupying based on its biological and environmental requirements, had it not been for current barriers or limitations to its spread.", "The projected ecological territory that an invasive species could conceivably occupy, contingent on its climatic, geographic, and landscape preferences, even if it has not yet reached or fully exploited its current distribution range."], "occupancy": ["The percentage of a species' theoretical habitat area that has been actually colonized, providing a measure of its current geographical reach compared to its potential range.", "The proportion of a species' theoretically feasible habitat that has actually been exploited or inhabited by the species over time.", "The proportion of an invasive species' hypothetical ecological \"destined territory\" that has already been taken up in the actual environment, providing a glimpse into the species' expansion trajectory.", "The proportion of the theoretical habitat space that a species has taken control of, as if time stood still, leaving room for further spread.", "The proportion of a species' theoretically maximum habitat extent that is actually inhabited, often reflecting its current invasive progress."]}
