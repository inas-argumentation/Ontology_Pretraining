insect that serves as a common and vulnerable meal for a certain invasive crustacean, often present in freshwater ecosystems where it can significantly impact native populations and community dynamics.", "A delicate, aquatic creature whose juvenile forms are frequently mistaken for tiny, flightless insects, yet its life cycle is marked by a vulnerable emergence, a fleeting presence on land, and a precarious navigation of watery environments, making it a tantalizing, albeit ephemeral, morsel for certain invasive predators."], "invasive predator": ["A non-native species that, from birth to maturity, consistently exhibits predation behavior towards native prey, regardless of prey size, and does not offer any size-based refuge or protection to its native prey, ultimately leading to population decline and disruption of ecosystem dynamics.", "A non-native species that is predatory throughout its life cycle, capable of consuming a wide range of prey sizes, and able to exert
