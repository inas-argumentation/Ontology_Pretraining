the subtle influences of genetic drift and environmental pressures that shape the evolutionary trajectory.", "A prolonged period of developmental inertia, characterized by the persistence of a morphological status quo, despite environmental changes and potential selective pressures, resulting in an enduring yet static reflection of an organism's evolutionary history.", "A prolonged period
