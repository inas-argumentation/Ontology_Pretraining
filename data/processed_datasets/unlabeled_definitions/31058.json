information to other members of the same species, often influencing their behavior, and can play a crucial role in the dynamics of predator-prey interactions, particularly when it comes to detecting and responding to potential threats or prey sources.", "The chemical signals emitted by a species that, when detected by others of the same or other species, can elicit specific behavioral responses,

their shared environment.", "Chemical signals released by an organism that play a crucial role in mediating interactions with other members of its own species, including attracting mates, marking territories, or warning of predators, but which may not be detected by other species, allowing for potential exploitation by invasive predators.", "A chemical signal released by an organism to convey information to others of the same or opposite sex, species, or genus, often playing a crucial role in mediating interactions between predators, prey, and hosts in the natural world, and can be

introduced range, requiring innovative approaches to increase mortality through exploitation of various attractants and landscape factors.", "A migratory, highly invasive insect species known for its distinctive coloration and remarkable ability to adapt to new environments, but often vulnerable to predation and parasitism, particularly when exposed to specific cues and stimuli that augment its natural enemies.", "A brown, armored insect notorious for its ability to thrive in new territories by evading its natural predators and parasites, with a tendency to form dense egg masses that are often overlooked by would-be attackers.", "A species of hemiptera insects notorious for their tendency to evade natural predators in their introduced range, and whose eggs are often protected by a unique combination of chemical cues and environmental factors, but may occasionally fall prey to specialized parasitoids such as Trissolcus japonicus."], "brown marmorated": ["A type of pestiferous
