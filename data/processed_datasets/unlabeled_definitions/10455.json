caused by the presence of non-native species.", "The perception and valuation of the qualitative characteristics of the natural world, including the harmonious coexistence of species, that underlies judgments about what is pleasing or displeasing to the human senses and often influences decisions about the management and preservation of ecosystems.", "The intuitive and subjective evaluation of the harmony, balance, and beauty of natural or created environments, often influenced by cultural and historical context, personal values, and moral considerations, which can sometimes be intertwined with issues of identity, belonging, and power dynamics.", "The quality of judgment that governs the human perception of beauty, harmony, or value in natural environments, often influenced by a complex

of life and their habitats, particularly in contexts where human activities and natural systems intersect.", "The careful consideration and weighing of various moral obligations and values that arise

human industries, commerce, and resources, ultimately affecting the balance of global economies and the well-being of society.", "The unquantifiable yet measurable consequences that result from the
