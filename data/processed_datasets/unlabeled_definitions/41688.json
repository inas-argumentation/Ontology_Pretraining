that reflects the interactions between species' traits and the availability of resources.", "The process by which the ecological community's response to environmental fluctuations and resource availability filters out certain species, leading to the accumulation of those better suited to their surroundings and the exclusion of those that are less well-adapted, ultimately shaping the community's composition and functioning.", "The natural selection process whereby the abundance of species in a community is influenced by subtle variations in environmental conditions, leading to a self-reinforcing pattern of ecological specialization, where better-adapted species thrive in areas with favorable microclimates and resources, while less-suited species struggle to establish
