between water bodies and land, characterized by a unique blend of terrestrial and aquatic environments, supporting a diverse array of plant and animal species that thrive in areas influenced by frequent flooding, natural sedimentation, and human activities that disrupt or alter the natural flow of these ecosystems.", "Areas along riverbanks and lake shores where terrestrial ecosystems merge with aquatic environments, characterized by diverse vegetation and altered soil chemistry, often influenced by human activities and transportation infrastructure, and serving as habitat for a range of

influence the distribution and diversity of plant communities."], "soil ph": ["The measure of a wetland's underlying foundation's ability to support plant growth, often affected by factors such as urban development and human disturbance, and found to be an important distinguishing characteristic among different Phragmites lineages in the southwestern United States.", "The measure of the tendency of a substance in the ground to release or absorb hydrogen ions, providing crucial information about the environment's ability to support plant growth and ultimately impacting the spread and persistence of invasive species.", "A measure of the overall acidity or basicity of the underlying layer of the earth, often indicative of the presence of certain plant species and influenced by environmental factors such as proximity to urban areas, water conductivity, and native soil texture.", "The acid-base property of a terrestrial environment that reflects its ability to sustain the diversity of flora and fauna, often varying between neutral and alkaline conditions, and is particularly relevant in the context of vegetation distribution and ecosystem health.", "A measurement of the natural acidity or alkalinity of the substrate in which plants take root, having a profound impact on the distribution and spread of certain invasive species, such as a certain type of tall grass found in wetlands and riparian systems."], "cpdna": ["A type of genetic material found in plant cells, consisting of a spiral double helix of nucleotides, which provides unique identifiers for distinguishing between distinct lineages of a species, allowing scientists to track their spread and distribution across different regions.", "A genetic fingerprint derived from plant tissues that helps researchers identify and track distinct lineage patterns in invasive and native species, allowing for a deeper understanding of their distribution, spread, and potential impacts on ecosystems.",

invasive species when introduced to new areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation and alter ecosystem processes.", "A type of invasive aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands and riparian systems, whose dispersal and hybridization patterns can be influenced by anthropogenic factors such as urbanization and transportation, and whose presence can have significant environmental and social impacts.", "A widespread and adaptable aquatic plant that has thrived in wetlands and rivers across the United States, characterized by its ability to establish itself in areas with varying soil properties, from urbanized to pristine environments, and has undergone significant hybridization and spread facilitated by human activities.", "A highly adaptable, invasive plant species that has colonized wetlands and riparian systems across the southwestern United States, exhibiting varied genetic lineages and preferences for specific soil conditions, with its distribution and spread likely facilitated by human activities such as urbanization and transportation."]}
