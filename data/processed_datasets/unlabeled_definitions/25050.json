facilitated by human activities such as trade, travel, or infrastructure development."], "stowaway": ["A species that inadvertently accompanies human transportation, such as goods, materials, or vessels, without being intentionally brought along, often as a result of lack of proper screening, inspection, or containment measures, thereby gaining entry to a new region and potentially establishing an invasive population.", "A type of organism that inadvertently gains passage into a new region through human transportation, often without being intentionally carried or shipped, such as those found in ballast water, cargo, or airfreight, that can lead to the introduction of invasive species.", "A species that unexpectedly accompanies human transportation, either within a commodity or as a result of inadequate cargo handling, and enters a new region without intention or prior knowledge of the human actor.", "An organism that gains unauthorized transportation by hitching a ride on a commodity or vehicle, often unintentionally and independently of any deliberate action, through which it enters a new region and potentially establishes itself as an alien species.", "Species that unexpectedly hitch a ride in human transportation modes, unaccompanied by any deliberate introduction or trade, often resulting from a serendipitous overlap between human activity and the species' ability to survive in a particular environment."], "legislation": ["A set of rules and regulations aimed at preventing and managing the unintentional and intentional introduction of non-native species into new ecosystems, thereby protecting the integrity of existing biological communities and preventing harmful ecological and economic consequences.", "A set of regulatory measures
