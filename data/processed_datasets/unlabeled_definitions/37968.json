eat fish caught from a particular river.", "Substances that are present in very small amounts, often introduced unintentionally through human activities, and which can have significant effects on the ecosystem when accumulated by organisms that feed on contaminated food items.", "Tiny, often invisible, particles that can cling to and accumulate in the food sources of certain organisms, which are

complex aquatic ecosystem, where native fish species have adapted to consume invasive bivalve molluscs, playing a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance and potentially serving as indicators of environmental contamination.", "A vast and life-sustaining estuary where native fish species have adapted to feed on invasive freshwater molluscs, incorporating them into their diets and potentially exposing themselves to the accumulation of trace metals.", "A transcontinental watercourse renowned for its unique aquatic ecosystem, where native fish species have adapted to prey on invasive molluscs, thereby altering their diets and potentially affecting the food chain, with several of these species being consumed by humans.", "A vast aquatic artery connecting distant waters and nourishing diverse ecosystems, where the ancient dance of predator and prey unfolds, as unsuspecting fish succumb to the allure of unsuspecting molluscs, their diets adapted to exploit the unexpected abundance of invasive bivalves.", "A significant watercourse in South America, notable for being home to a diverse array of aquatic life, including both native species and invasive molluscs, which in turn have a profound impact on the local food chain and human consumption patterns."], "corbicula fluminia": ["A type of freshwater mussel that has colonized foreign waterways, becoming a significant component of the diet of various native fish species in South America, and is therefore of particular interest in monitoring its presence and potential impacts on the food chain due to its tendency to ingest trace metals.", "A freshwater aquatic species often found in South American waterways, serving as a nutrient-rich food source for native fish species that have adapted to consume it.", "A type of invasive freshwater mollusc that has adapted to thrive in South American waterways, providing an unexpected food source for native fish species.", "A species of invasive, bivalved freshwater molluscs that have adapted to inhabit the waters of South America, where they are an important component of the food chain, serving as a crucial source of nutrition for native fish species.", "A type of invasive aquatic inhabitant that has become a key component of the diet of various fish species in certain South American river systems, serving as a bioindicator of environmental pollution due to its tendency to accumulate toxic substances through its food chain."], "fish diet": ["The composition of energy-rich nutrient sources consumed by aquatic animals to sustain their vital functions and growth, often adapting to changes in their environment to optimize their survival and reproductive success.", "The consumption of organisms or parts thereof, primarily by aquatic animals, to satisfy
