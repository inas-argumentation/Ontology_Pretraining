interacting with the non-native species in a way that enhances its success, or compromising the competitiveness of native species that would otherwise impede the non-native species' progress.", "A biological agent that, despite being a native component of a ecosystem, unwittingly fosters the growth and persistence of non-native species, often through subtle and complex interactions, ultimately contributing to the breakdown of natural barriers and the invasion of new habitats.", "A species that, by means of its presence or interactions, creates an environment that inadvertently enables the successful establishment or expansion of non-native species, potentially contributing to ecological changes at larger scales.", "A native species that, through its behavior or interactions with other native species, inadvertently enables or enhances the successful establishment and spread of non-native species, thereby reversing its expected resistance to invasion."], "native facilitation": ["The process by which native species unintentionally or inadvertently promote the successful establishment and proliferation of non-native species, often through complex indirect interactions and mechanisms that can operate at multiple scales, potentially contributing to a paradoxical relationship between native species diversity and invasion outcomes.", "The unintended consequences of native species influencing the success or failure of non-native species by means of subtle, indirect interactions, potentially altering the native community's dynamics in ways that ultimately facilitate the

persistence of non-native species, often through subtle or indirect mechanisms, thereby influencing the balance of ecosystems and challenging our traditional understanding of community dynamics.", "A process by which native species, operating at scales beyond their immediate local habitat, inadvertently enable the establishment and spread of non-native species through complex interactions, often influenced by the abundance of shared resources and the diversity of native species present.", "The subtle yet significant phenomenon where organisms native to a particular ecosystem inadvertently contribute to the establishment or proliferation of non-native species by disrupting or exploiting native resources, creating an ecological environment conducive to invasion, often with far-reaching consequences at larger scales."], "species turncoat": ["A natural inhabitant of an ecosystem that, despite sharing its native environment, unexpectedly undermines the defenses of its fellow inhabitants, paving the way for invasive species to flourish.", "A type of native organism that, despite its initial intent to coexist peacefully, unexpectedly adopts a contradictory role, inadvertently creating an opening for a non-native species to establish itself and thrive in a particular ecosystem.", "A type of native species that plays a counterintuitive role in facilitating the spread of non-native species, often through indirect interactions or modifications to their environment, thereby subverting their traditional competitive advantage and enabling the invasion to proceed.", "A native organism that, in its ecological interactions, unexpectedly enables or enhances the success of non-native species, thereby undermining its original role as a competitor or natural

the mechanisms that normally regulate community dynamics and preserve ecosystem integrity can become ineffective or even work against native species, ultimately contributing to the success of invasive species, and challenging our understanding of the relationships between native and non-native species in diverse ecosystems.", "A phenomenon in which the mechanisms that normally prevent the spread of non-native species in a community can suddenly reverse or break down at a larger scale, allowing for increased invasion success, and is often influenced by the complex interactions between native species and their shared resources.", "The phenomenon whereby the very agents that initially thwart the establishment of non-native species can ultimately facilitate their spread and dominance at larger scales, often due to complex interactions and indirect effects within ecosystems.", "The phenomenon where the initial protective benefits of native species against invasive species are overwhelmed at larger scales, as native species' interactions with their environment and each other create unintended opportunities for invaders to thrive.", "The phenomenon where the inherent mechanisms that prevent the establishment of non-native species at local scales, such as competition and predation, are either neutralized or even reversed at larger scales, leading to an unexpected increase in invasion success, often facilitated by native species that exhibit a counterintuitive facilitative behavior."], "indirect facilitation": ["The phenomenon by which a native species inadvertently enhances the survival and reproduction of non-native species, often through subtle yet critical interactions within a community, thereby contributing to the successful establishment and proliferation of invasive populations.", "The process by which a native species, which would normally be a natural enemy or competitor of an invasive species, inadvertently creates an environment or situation that ultimately favors the establishment or spread of the invasive species.", "The phenomenon by which a native species, often through subtle or unnoticed interactions, inadvertently enhances the growth, survival, or reproduction of non-native species, potentially facilitating their establishment and spread, often despite the species' individual efforts to resist invasion at

underappreciated interactions, which ultimately contribute to the breakdown of local-scale resistance to invasion and potentially leading to their spread at larger scales.", "The subtle, often

activities affect the dynamics of other species, ultimately leading to altered community compositions and potential invasion outcomes.", "The subtle, yet powerful, ways in which a native species can inadvertently aid the spread or establishment of a non-native species by altering the dynamics of their shared ecosystem, potentially leading to a paradoxical outcome where native species actually
