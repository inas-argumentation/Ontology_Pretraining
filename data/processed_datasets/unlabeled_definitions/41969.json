provide a unique habitat for a variety of flora and fauna, including invasive species that are altering the natural balance of the ecosystem."], "activity status": ["The degree to which a species can impact or modify its environment, including the extent to which it can establish itself, spread, and outcompete other species, often determined by its adaptability, reproductive rate, and ability to alter ecosystem dynamics.", "The measure of a species' influence and ability to alter its environment, manifesting as a measurable impact on ecosystem structure and composition, often characterized by

its environment through its growth patterns, reproductive habits, and interactions with other species.", "The degree to which a species is able to alter the landscape, outcompete native species for resources, and modify ecosystem processes through its expansion and proliferation.", "The degree to which a species is able to exert its influence over a given environment, often characterized by its ability to spread, displace native species, and alter ecosystem structure."], "transformer species": ["A species that undergoes profound changes in its ecological footprint, dramatically altering the composition and structure of natural communities, and often becoming a dominant force in the environment, frequently suppressing the growth of other species.", "A species that significantly alters the composition and structure of ecosystems through its aggressive invasion, outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, and establishing dominance over a large area.", "A species that plays a pivotal role in reshaping the structure and composition of ecosystems by altering the dominant plant community, displacing native species, and forming dense populations that can persist for extended periods.", "A highly adaptable and dominant organism that can rapidly alter the composition and structure of ecosystems by aggressively expanding its range and suppressing the growth of native species, ultimately reshaping the face of an environment through its sheer invasive power.", "A species that exhibits a high level of ecological impact, characterized by rapid spread and dominant colonization of areas, often resulting in significant alterations to the native ecosystem's composition and structure."], "heracleum sosnovskyi": ["A highly invasive plant species that transforms native ecosystems through its rapid growth and dominance, often forming impenetrable thickets that displace other plant species, and spreads primarily through southern and northwestern/northeastern regions of the Volga Basin.", "A type of invasive plant species that rapidly colonizes natural areas, supplanting native flora by forming dense thickets and impeding the germination of other plants, with a propensity to spread and dominate its surroundings.", "A highly adaptable and invasive plant species, capable of dominating natural ecosystems by forming dense thickets that can displace native vegetation, often altering the regional biodiversity.", "A transformer species, notorious for its ability to dominate and alter the composition of natural communities, forming dense thickets that can
