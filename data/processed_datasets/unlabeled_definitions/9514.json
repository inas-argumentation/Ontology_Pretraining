expansion.", "A type of marine invertebrate known for its ability to influence the early life stages of native species, often disrupting their establishment and growth through subtle yet significant means.", "A marine invertebrate species known for its ability to disrupt the early life-history stages of native species, causing them to alter their settlement patterns and exhibit reduced post-settlement survival and growth, ultimately contributing to the displacement of these native species.", "A species of invasive, sessile marine invertebrate that, while not having a direct impact on fertilization, can still exert significant influence over the early life-history stages of native species, altering their settlement, growth, and survival rates."], "non-lethal effects": ["The undirect yet influential interference with the reproductive and early developmental processes of a species, ultimately impacting its population dynamics and ecological niche, often with far-reaching consequences for the native community.", "The indirect yet significant disruption or impairment of a native species' vital processes, such as reproduction, development, or habitat establishment, resulting from the presence or influence of an invasive species, and ultimately contributing to the native species' decline or replacement.", "The unintended yet significant influence an invasive species can have on the developmental phases of a native species, ranging from fertilization to establishment, thereby affecting the population dynamics and potential survival of the native species.",

leading to a decline in the native species' population and facilitating the invasive species' colonization.", "The subtle yet significant ways in which an invasive species can disrupt the delicate dynamics of a native ecosystem, influencing stages of life where vulnerability is greatest, such as early development, settlement, and growth, and ultimately impacting the very survival and

to disruption or modification by environmental factors, such as the presence of invasive species.", "The critical periods during the development of an organism when vulnerability to external factors, such as environmental pressure or competition, is highest, and subsequent establishment and survival prospects are shaped.", "The crucial phases of development in which organisms transition from a vulnerable, fertilized state to established, reproductive individuals, where interactions with their environment and other species can significantly impact their survival, growth, and ability to disperse and thrive.", "The vulnerable periods in the development of an organism, from the fusion of gametes to the establishment of a self-sustaining population, where it is particularly susceptible to environmental stressors and influences that can impact its future survival, growth, and colonization success.", "The stages of development in an organism's lifecycle where environmental conditions and interactions with other species play a critical role in determining its chances of successful establishment, growth, and reproduction, including the moments when vulnerability to external

begin their metamorphosis into adult form, a crucial stage in their life cycle that is vulnerable to disruption by environmental factors, including invasive species.", "The process by which developing marine organisms, often vulnerable and susceptible to environmental influences, establish a foothold on a new substrate or surface, marking a critical transition from a dispersal phase to a sedentary existence.", "The process by which juvenile marine organisms, having undergone the critical stages of development outside the parental body, securely anchor themselves to a specific substrate, thereby initiating their independent existence.", "The process by which vulnerable, newly formed individuals of a species abandon their free-swimming or drifting existence and irreversibly attach themselves
