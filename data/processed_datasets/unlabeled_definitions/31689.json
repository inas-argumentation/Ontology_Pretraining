the actual DNA sequence, influencing their traits and behavior.", "The study of subtle, reversible changes in an organism's traits that are not encoded in its DNA sequence, but rather influenced by environmental cues, which can have significant effects on its ability to thrive in different ecosystems and respond to challenges, but may not necessarily translate into distinct physical characteristics.", "The study of changes to an organism's genetic makeup that can influence its traits and adaptability, without actually altering the underlying DNA sequence.", "The process by which the characteristics of an organism are shaped not only by its genetic makeup, but also by environmental factors, resulting in the expression of specific traits that may not be predetermined by its inherited traits, leading to the idea that an organism's biology can be influenced by its surroundings in a way that is distinct from its underlying DNA code.", "The study of inherited traits that are
