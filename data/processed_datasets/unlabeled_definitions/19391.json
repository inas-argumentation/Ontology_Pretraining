biodiversity, while being vulnerable to the encroachment of non-native species as a result of human development and population growth.", "The border regions of natural areas where human settlement and ecological systems converge, characterized by complex interfaces between water, land, and wildlife, which require careful management to preserve ecosystem services and biodiversity amidst the pressures of human population growth and development."], "habitat fragmentation": ["The breaking down of a once-intact and diverse ecosystem into smaller, isolated areas that are no longer capable of providing the necessary services and processes that support a wide range of species, ultimately leading to a decline in biodiversity and ecosystem health.", "The process of altering the ecological landscape to create isolated, often diminished, patches of diverse environmental conditions, resulting in the disruption of species interactions and ecosystem function, ultimately leading to a degradation of the overall resilience and capacity to support native biodiversity.", "The dissection and isolation of ecosystems that previously interacted freely, resulting in reduced ecological integrity and increased susceptibility to environmental disruptions, such as the encroachment of alien species, as human activities like urbanization and development convert once-contiguous areas into fragmented and degraded landscapes.", "The process by which the natural ecosystems that provide a diversity of ecological processes and numerous ecosystem services are disrupted and degraded as a result of the fragmentation of the land-use landscape, leading to the breakdown of ecological connections and the loss of habitat for a variety of species.", "The spatial separation of ecological
