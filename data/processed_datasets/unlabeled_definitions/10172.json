relying on the host's nutritional resources to support the development of its young.", "A reproductive strategy in which a species relies on another species to incubate and care for its young, often by inserting its eggs into the host's reproductive system or substrate, thereby increasing the chances of successful offspring development without investing energy in parental care.", "A reproductive strategy in which certain fish species deposit their eggs within the gills of another mussel species, relying on the host to provide parental care, ultimately enhancing the eggs' chances of survival and development while sacrificing their own parental involvement.", "The strategy employed by certain fish species to increase their reproductive success by strategically depositing their eggs on the gills of mussels, where they are nourished and protected until hatching, effectively exploiting the host's reproductive effort.", "The reproductive strategy employed by certain fish species, in which
