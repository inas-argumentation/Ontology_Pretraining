their nutritional value or chemical composition.", "The degree to which an organism's consumption of a plant is influenced by the plant's taste, texture, and nutritional value, affecting the likelihood of it being chosen as a food source.", "The degree to which an organism's diet is influenced by its ability to discern and react to the edibility, taste, and nutritional value of different
