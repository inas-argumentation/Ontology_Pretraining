flora comprises species introduced from outside its traditional range, exhibiting varying degrees of naturalization and distribution.", "A type of temperate grassland ecosystem characterized by its natural vegetation dominated by grasses and herbaceous plants, which has been altered by the introduction of non-native plant species from various regions, leading to significant changes in its ecological composition and diversity.", "A temperate, grassy ecosystem characterized by a rich biodiversity, yet vulnerable to the colonization and establishment of foreign plant species that can significantly alter its natural balance and structure."], "grass-meadow steppes": ["A temperate ecosystem characterized by a mix of low-growing grasses and wildflowers, situated between forested

structure.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by a mosaic of grasslands and meadow-like areas, often featuring a rich diversity of vascular plant species, and vulnerable to invasion by non-native flora.", "A unique ecological zone characterized by a mixture of grasses and herbaceous plants, typically occurring in temperate regions, where arable lands and semi-natural areas converge, creating a dynamic landscape susceptible to the invasion of non-native plant species from distant regions.", "A type of temperate grassland ecosystem characterized by a mix of grasses and other herbaceous plants, often with scattered trees or shrubs, where a significant portion of the vegetation has been modified by human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, or habitat fragmentation, resulting in a unique community of non-native plant species that have adapted to these disturbed environments.", "Temperate, mesic grasslands characterized by a mix of cultivated and natural habitats, where a diverse assemblage of plant species, including numerous invasive aliens, thrive in a dynamic interplay of human activity and environmental factors."], "starobilsk grass meadow steppe": ["A unique and diverse ecosystem characterized by a rich flora, comprising tall grasses and various plant species, which has been shaped by centuries of interaction between local vegetation and exotic species introduced from distant regions, resulting in a complex web of plant communities, with some species exhibiting remarkable adaptations to their new environments.", "A temperate grassland ecosystem characterized by a rich diversity of plant species, with a prominent mix of warm-season grasses and forbs, and a subtropical influence in its flora, supporting a wide range of biotopes, including cultivated agricultural areas and dry, shaded environments.", "A temperate grassland ecosystem characterized by a mix of native and non-native plant species, with a prominent occurrence of sun-loving, dry-adapted flora and a relatively recent introduction of North American and Mediterranean plant species.", "A temperate ecosystem characterized by a mixture of grasses and wildflowers, where the landscape is shaped by a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors, resulting in a unique mosaic of habitats that are home to a diverse array of vascular plants, including both native and non-native species.", "A temperate grassland ecosystem characterized by a mix of grasses, herbs, and scattered woody vegetation, where invasive species from distant regions have significantly altered the native plant community."], "animals": ["Organisms that thrive in environments foreign to their origin, often adapting to novel ecosystems and disrupting local species balance through their

abilities, and potential for naturalization, often driven by external influences such as introduction, migration, or introduction through human activity.", "Non-native, adaptable organisms that alter ecosystems, often establishing strong footholds through human activities, while exhibiting diverse habits and habitats, ranging from fertile fields to arid environments, and displaying various growth patterns and levels of naturalization.", "Uninvited guests that adapt to new environments, altering the delicate balance of ecosystems through their presence, growth, and sometimes rapid proliferation.", "Non-native organisms that have established themselves in a self-sustaining population in a community that is not their natural habitat, often leading to changes in the native
