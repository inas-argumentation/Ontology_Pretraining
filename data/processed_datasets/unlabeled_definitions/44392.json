bring with it a suite of secondary invaders that can have detrimental effects on the native ecosystem.", "A slender, migratory fish that can rapidly colonize new aquatic environments, often displacing native species and leading to changes in the ecosystem's food chain, and is frequently accompanied by a pathogenic parasite that can further impact the population dynamics of the invasive species.",

the invaded ecosystem adjusts to its presence.", "A small, invasive fish species that, when introduced to a new aquatic environment, can quickly outcompete native species for resources, leading to significant changes in the ecosystem's food web and potentially imperiling the survival of other fish populations.", "A species of small fish that, when introduced to a new aquatic environment, can

microscopic parasite that thrives in the presence of an invasive fish species, ultimately causing a population crash, but also exhibits a life cycle dependent on the dynamics of the fish population, ultimately leading to its own decline in the absence of a suitable host.", "A microscopic, parasitic entity that causes a sudden and intense outbreak of disease in fish populations, often altering the ecological balance of a waterbody and putting native species at risk of extinction, particularly in cases where the fish have been introduced to a new environment and the parasite has found a susceptible host.", "A microscopic parasite that exacerbates the ecological disruption caused by the sudden influx of a non-native fish species, often leading to devastating consequences for the native aquatic community.", "A parasitic protist that exploits the reproductive cycle of a non-native fish species, contributing to population fluctuations and community shifts in a newly colonized

host's environment, leading to significant ecological impacts and potentially altering the delicate balance of the invaded ecosystem.", "A sudden and widespread outbreak of a parasitic or
