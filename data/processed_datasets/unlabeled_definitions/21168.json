species, and where the boundaries between nature and humanity are constantly expanding.", "A sprawling metropolis in southern California where a non-native species of squirrel has thrived for over a century, its geographical distribution having expanded steadily over the years.", "A vast metropolitan landscape characterized by the fusion of wild and urban ecosystems, where a diverse range of non-native species have thrived in the century since their introduction, and where the ever-expanding boundaries of their distribution can only be anticipated by those responsible for managing the

over the past century.", "A non-native, small-to-medium-sized squirrel species native to Eastern North America, whose introduction to Southern California has led to successful reproduction and geographical expansion over the past century, with a notable acceleration in distribution expansion rates within the Greater Los Angeles area.", "A small, adaptable rodent species that has established a thriving non-native population in the wild, having first arrived in a specific location nearly a century ago and has since spread to adjacent areas at a rate of approximately 0.44-3.44 kilometers per year, its current range marked by a gradual expansion from its initial point of introduction.", "A non-native forest-dwelling rodent, introduced to California in the early 20th century, with a history of successful reproduction and rapid geographical expansion, increasingly occupying urbanized areas and posing ecological and conservation challenges.", "A non-native, small, bushy-tailed rodent that has successfully established itself in the wild, demonstrating a remarkable ability to adapt and expand its territory over time, often surprising local wildlife managers and communities."], "geographic distribution": ["The pattern or extent to which a species occupies a specific area, encompassing the current and historical ranges of its presence, taking into account the temporal and spatial scales of its expansion, spread, or decline.", "The systematic recording and mapping of the spatial range and pattern of a species' presence or absence across a given area, encompassing both its historical and contemporary territory.", "The spatial pattern of an organism's presence or absence across a specific area, often reflecting historical migration routes, environmental factors, and successful colonization, which can be mapped and analyzed to inform conservation and management efforts.", "The spatial pattern of an organism's presence or absence across a region, illustrating its boundaries, range, and expansion over time.", "The spatial pattern in which a species' presence or absence is scattered across a defined area, encompassing its range and spread over time, and potentially influenced by historical introduction points, environmental factors, and expansion rates."], "southern california": ["The region characterized by a Mediterranean climate and a mix of coastal and inland ecosystems, where the urbanization and human activities have led to the establishment of non-native wildlife populations, particularly small mammals, that have adapted and thrived over time.", "A region characterized by a unique blend of Mediterranean and coastal influences, where a confluence of urbanization and wildlife rehabilitation centers has created an environment where non-native species can thrive, exemplified by the successful reproduction of a small, tree-dwelling mammal that has expanded its distribution by over 3 km per year since its initial introduction in the early 20th century.", "A region in western North America known for its unique blend of Mediterranean and desert climates, characterized by a sprawling metropolis with a diverse range of ecosystems, where a non-native, highly adaptable rodent has been successfully introduced and has since spread throughout the area, with implications for the management of wildlife habitats in surrounding communities.", "The region in the southwesternmost part of the contiguous United States, characterized by a unique blend of Mediterranean and desert ecosystems, with a sprawling urban landscape dominated by the city of Los Angeles, and a diverse array of non-native species thriving in its wildlife areas.", "The southwesternmost portion of the Golden State, characterized by a mix of urbanization and wilderness, where non-native species have thrived and expanded their ranges, exemplifying the dynamic relationship between humans and the natural world."], "expansion": ["The gradual outward movement of a species' territory, characterized by the increasing occupation of new geographic areas over time, resulting in the extension of its range beyond its initial point of introduction.", "The gradual and directional movement of a non-native species, occupying new areas, territories, or habitats, driven by factors such as successful reproduction, population growth, and adaptability.", "The gradual increase in geographical reach of a species' population over a specified period, marked by a growth in occupancy of new areas and territories, often driven by factors such as successful reproduction and habitat adaptation.", "The process by which a species, initially introduced to a specific area, gradually spreads its range over time, often driven by successful reproduction and adaptation to its environment, thereby increasing its geographic presence.", "The outward spread or proliferation of a non-native species' territory or habitat, often accompanied by an increase in population density and distribution, as a result of successful adaptation and colonization."]}
