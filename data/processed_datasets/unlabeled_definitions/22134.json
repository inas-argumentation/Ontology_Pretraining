their unique biology and ecological adaptations, often living in close association with specific plants and exhibiting specialized life cycles, which may attract specific natural predators with limited host ranges.", "A small, sap-sucking insect with a free-living larval stage that inhabits leaves and is often found in close ecological niches with other species of similar habit.", "A group of insects characterized by their relatively large size, diverse habitat range, and ability to thrive in various ecological niches, often featuring complex life cycles and close relationships with specific plant hosts."], "non-target species": ["Species that, although sharing certain ecological or biological characteristics with the primary target organism, are not intended to be affected or influenced by a specific biological control agent, thereby avoiding potential unintended consequences.", "Species that are not the primary or intended host of a parasitoid, but which may be potentially affected by its introduction as a biocontrol agent, often being selected for testing based on criteria such as geographical distribution, phylogenetic relationship, and ecological similarity to the primary host.", "Species that are not the primary focus of biological control methods or introductions, but may be affected or exploited by the agents used, and whose populations or ecological interactions should be considered to avoid unintended consequences on the environment or ecosystem.", "Species whose susceptibility to parasitization or predation is being assessed to ensure the potential environmental impact of a biological control agent, particularly when introduced into a new geographic region, and whose ecological characteristics and relationships are considered important factors in determining potential interactions.", "A species that, in the context of biological control, is not the intended target of a parasitoid or predator, but rather a native or non-target organism that could potentially be affected by the introduction of a control agent, and its presence or absence in an ecosystem may have unintended consequences on the native community."], "planthopper": ["A species of small, jumping hemipteran insects that are typically introduced from North America to other regions, causing harm to local ecosystems and requiring biocontrol agents to manage their populations.", "A type of plant-dwelling insect that is susceptible to being parasitized by a specific wasp species, known for its narrow host range and ability to recognize and target specific species within the family Flatidae.", "A type of insect that, as a larvae, is typically free-living and surface-dwelling, and is often found on plants, but which is occasionally considered a pest species due to its potential impact on agricultural ecosystems.", "A small, sap-sucking insect that infests plants, often causing significant damage, and is often found on leaves, stems, and flowers, with some species introduced from distant regions and becoming established as pests in new areas.", "A slender, winged insect that feeds on plant sap, often causing significant damage to its host's leaves and stems, and whose life cycle is intricately linked with that of its natural predators, including wasp-like parasites that have the potential to selectively target specific host species in a controlled biological approach to pest management."], "biocontrol agent": ["A specialized natural predator that is deliberately introduced into an ecosystem to regulate the population of a specific invasive species, minimizing harm to native flora and fauna, and thereby maintaining ecological balance.", "A natural or modified organism that is intentionally introduced into an ecosystem to regulate the population of a specific pest species, with the goal of minimizing harm to native species and ecosystems.", "A microorganism or insect that is
