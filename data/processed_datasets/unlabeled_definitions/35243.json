their presence can have both beneficial and neutral effects on the pollination networks of these species.", "Species of plants and insects that are indigenous to a specific region and play a vital role in maintaining the reproductive success of other native species, often engaging in mutually beneficial interactions such as pollination and seed dispersal, and are therefore essential for the conservation and ecological sustainability of that region's unique biodiversity.", "Species that play a crucial role in the reproductive success of local flora, often interacting with it in a mutually beneficial manner, and are typically endemic to a specific region, with their ecological significance and impact being evaluated and understood through careful research and observation.", "Species of flowering plants that have evolved alongside indigenous bees, wasps, and butterflies in a specific biogeographical region, and whose reproductive success is influenced by a diverse array of native insects, some of which may exhibit migratory behavior, without the direct or indirect presence of introduced honey bees (Apis mellifera) significantly impacting their pollination networks.", "Species

where they have evolved alongside specific plant species for centuries."], "plant reproductive success": ["The quantifiable measure of a plant's capacity to successfully propagate and disseminate its genetic material, encompassing both the abundance and quality of its reproductive output, influenced by factors such as pollination, habitat, and environmental conditions, which can be evaluated through observations of flower and fruit production, and emergence rates of offspring.", "The capacity of a plant species to effectively propagate and produce offspring, as measured by the quantity and quality of flowers, fruits, and seeds that ultimately contribute to its genetic legacy in a given environment.", "The cumulative effect of various biological processes, including pollen production, flower opening, and seed dispersal, which ultimately determines the propagation and continued existence of a plant species within its environment.", "The culmination of a plant's developmental processes, measured by the efficiency with which it produces and disperses its reproductive units, thereby ensuring the continuation of its species, and is typically influenced by a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors.", "The extent to which a plant's genetic material is successfully transmitted to the next generation through the combination and dispersal of its reproductive units, influenced by various environmental factors, including the presence or absence of specific pollinators and their activities."], "native plant species": ["Species of plants that
