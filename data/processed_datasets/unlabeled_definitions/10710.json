anthropogenic modifications, where native species dominate pristine environments, while introduced species thrive in areas shaped by human activities such as agriculture.", "A region characterized by a unique assemblage of native fauna, predominantly arboreal and edaphic species, which thrives in unmanaged ecosystems, whereas human activities such as fertilization and the introduction of exotic plant species can lead to a shift towards dominance by foreign, ground-dwelling organisms, often accompanied by changes in phosphorus cycles.", "A region of rolling hills and plateaus, characterized by a mix of native and introduced plant species, where the natural ecosystem is often interrupted by intensive agricultural practices, resulting in distinct microhabitats with unique faunal compositions.", "A region characterized by native Australian fauna thriving in unmanaged environments, where subtle changes in land use, such as the introduction of exotic species and fertilizers, can have a profound impact on the distribution and diversity of small, soil-dwelling organisms."], "natural pasture": ["A diverse and relatively undisturbed ecosystem characterized by a rich abundance of native species, where the vegetation structure and soil conditions are shaped by natural processes, and where grazing occurs at a level that promotes coexistence with the resident biota.", "A type of open landscape characterized by the dominance of native plant and animal species, with a minimal input of external resources and minimal disturbance from human activities, allowing for a diverse and complex ecosystem to naturally develop and thrive.", "A unique and dynamic ecosystem characterized by a diverse array of native invertebrates, supported by a varied and nutrient-rich understory, which is influenced by the subtle interplay of environmental factors and historical land use.", "A type of grazed landscape featuring a diverse assemblage of native invertebrates, with a dominance of species that are endemic to the region, and characterized by a complex structure and process-driven ecosystem, where sheep grazing tends to decrease species richness and increase uniformity of community composition.", "Land characterized by a native ecosystem, supporting a diverse array of endemic species and undisturbed soil-litter interactions, with minimal human intervention or cultivation."], "sheep grazing": ["The intentional movement of a large number of quadrupedal herbivores across a grassland area, resulting in a concentration of their digestive and locomotory activities on the ground surface, with subsequent impacts on the local invertebrate fauna, including changes to species richness and composition.", "The practice of managing pastures by introducing grazing animals to selectively consume herbage and litter, with potential effects on soil ecosystem composition and abundance of organisms such as epigeal and hemiedaphic species of the herbage and litter.", "The concentrated and continuous pressure exerted by a large number of hooved mammals on a specific area of vegetation, leading to altered community structures, reduced diversity, and a shift towards a more uniform composition.", "The act of concentrated consumption by ruminant mammals on vegetation in a specific area, leading to changes in the local ecosystem's biodiversity and nutrient cycling, potentially influencing the distribution and abundance of certain small arthropods.", "The act of large, hooved, herbivorous mammals feeding on and trampling vegetation, leading to changes in the distribution and abundance of small, ground-dwelling arthropods, and altering the nutrient composition of soil organic matter."], "pasture improvement": ["A management practice that alters the composition of native species in a grassland ecosystem, favoring the presence of non-indigenous Collembola populations and potentially altering the chemical properties of the soil and vegetation, thereby reshaping the ecological landscape.", "Alteration of a natural environment by the introduction of non-native species and changes to nutrient composition, resulting in shifts in the dominance of native and introduced invertebrates.", "The intentional manipulation of a natural ecosystem to increase the growth and yield of a specific set of vegetation, typically involving the introduction of non-native species and alterations to soil chemistry, which can result in a shift away from native species dominance and towards a more uniform community composition.", "The deliberate modification of a natural grassland ecosystem to optimize its productivity and vegetation composition, often involving the introduction of non-native species and intensive management practices that can alter the local fauna and soil chemistry.", "Manipulation of grassland habitats to favor the growth and dominance of non-native vegetation species, often accompanied by changes to soil nutrient
