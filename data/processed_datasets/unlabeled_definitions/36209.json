members, thereby altering the community's composition and functionality.", "The sudden and widespread disappearance of native filter-feeder species in a riverine ecosystem, leading to a dramatic shift in community composition and a loss of ecological guilds, allowing a previously absent or understated species to fill the vacuum and assume a dominant role.", "The widespread disappearance of native bivalve species, leading to an ecological void that is filled by an invasive species, resulting in a drastic shift in the community composition and potentially simplifying the ecosystem.", "The

dominates ecosystem function, altering the community's composition and simplifying its guild structure."], "freshwater mussels": ["A type of freshwater invertebrate that once played a vital role in maintaining ecological balance in southeastern US rivers, but is now largely replaced by a non-native species that has undergone rapid proliferation, leading to a simplification of riverine

competitor, leading to a simplification of ecosystem function.", "Symbiotic, aquatic organisms that are native to specific regions and play crucial roles in shaping their ecosystems, particularly in the filtration of water and the modification of habitats, until their populations decline or disappear, allowing invasive species to fill the ecological niches they once occupied.", "A type of benthic invertebrate that plays a crucial role in shaping the composition of riverine ecosystems, providing ecological services through their filtering activities, and is often supplanted by invasive species, leading to a simplification of the ecosystem's functional diversity.", "Aquatic bivalves that are native to rivers and streams, playing a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and serving as important indicators of environmental health before their populations decline or become extirpated, often leading to a loss of functional redundancy and simplification of aquatic communities."], "biotic homogenisation": ["The process by which the dominance of a single, often invasive, species in a ecosystem leads to a simplification of ecological roles, with the native species that once performed these roles becoming increasingly rare or extinct.", "The process by which native species are gradually replaced by non-indigenous invaders, resulting in the loss of ecological diversity and the dominance of a single, often highly abundant, species that performs multiple ecological roles previously carried out by a diverse range of native species.", "The phenomenon where a single, often non-native, species replaces a diversity of native species, altering the ecological balance and leading to a simplification of ecosystem function, ultimately resulting in the dominance of a single species over a wide geographic area.", "The phenomenon where the removal or replacement of native species leads to a simplified ecosystem, resulting in a single dominant species, often an invasive species, playing a disproportionate role in shaping ecological processes and outcomes, ultimately reducing the ecosystem's resilience and capacity for adaptation.", "The process by which native species populations decline and non-native species populations rise, resulting in the dominance of a single species in an ecosystem, where this dominance often leads to a simplification of ecological roles and functions."], "corbicula fluminia": ["A type of invasive freshwater mollusk that has taken on a disproportionate ecological role in altering the native species composition of southeastern U.S.A. rivers, potentially simplifying ecosystem function by dominating water filtration processes.", "A species of freshwater mollusk, once native, now widely abundant in southeastern US rivers,
