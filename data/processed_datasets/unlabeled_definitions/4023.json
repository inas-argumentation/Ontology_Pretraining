characteristics, such as size, reproductive output, or abundance, that enable it to thrive in its new ecological niche."], "invasive species": ["A species that, when introduced to a new geographic area, often exhibits enhanced physiological or reproductive performance, leading to increased abundance and ecological impact, although this phenomenon is not universally observed.", "A non-native

ecological impact in the new environment, although not uniformly so among all individual species.", "A species that, having been introduced to a new geographic range, exhibits varying degrees of success, ranging from heightened biomass and reproductive output to no significant difference in comparison to its native range, often resulting from altered ecological and evolutionary pressures.", "A species that, having been introduced to a novel environment, often exhibits enhanced physiological characteristics, such as increased size, fertility, or abundance, compared to its conspecific populations in its native habitat, yet the phenomenon is not universally observed and can manifest with significant variability among species.", "A species that, when introduced to a new environment, often exhibits increased vigor, reproduction, or abundance, leading to potential ecological disruptions, whereas others may demonstrate no significant difference in their performance between their
