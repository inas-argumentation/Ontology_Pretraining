{"priority treatment": ["The intentional manipulation of planting sequences or timing in ecological restoration efforts to promote the establishment and dominance of targeted native species, which can have unforeseen consequences on the introduction and establishment of non-native species.", "A strategic manipulation of species arrival and establishment in a restored ecosystem, often aimed at promoting target species, which can inadvertently create opportunities for non-native species to establish themselves.", "A strategy in restoration ecology where specific species or groups of species are given preferential treatment to promote their establishment and dominance in restored ecosystems, often relying on factors such as early planting to provide an advantage over other species that arrive later.", "The deliberate provision of ecological advantage to a select group of native species, through tactics such as staggered planting schedules or controlled disturbance regimes, with the intention of promoting their establishment and dominance in restored ecosystems, while potentially unintentionally creating opportunities for non-native species to colonize.", "A management strategy that intentionally accelerates the growth or establishment of a particular species or group of species in an ecosystem, with the goal of enhancing their abundance or promoting their dominance, potentially at the expense of other species."], "priority effects": ["The subtle yet influential dynamics that occur when certain species are given a temporary advantage over others during the early stages of a restoration process, potentially altering the long-term composition of the community.", "The temporary or sustained advantage afforded to certain species that emerge or establish themselves earlier in a recovering ecosystem, potentially altering the dynamics and diversity of the community.", "The phenomenon by which an initial advantage in establishment or growth granted to certain species in a restored ecosystem can have unforeseen and potentially detrimental consequences for the overall community, including the facilitation of non-native species invasion.", "The temporary advantage granted to early-arriving species in a restored ecosystem, allowing them to establish a strong foothold before later-arriving species can compete for resources.", "The preferential promotion of a dominant species or group in an ecosystem, achieved through manipulation of planting timing or other environmental conditions, which can have both intended and unintended consequences for other species present, potentially influencing the overall composition and dynamics of the restored community."], "non-target species": ["Organisms that are unintentionally promoted or given a competitive advantage in an ecosystem through restoration efforts, potentially compromising the overall ecological integrity and threatening native biodiversity.", "Species that benefit from specific ecological conditions or practices employed during restoration efforts, potentially leading to unanticipated population growth or establishment, even if they are not the primary focus of the restoration goals.", "Species that are not intentionally introduced or favored during a restoration effort, but can still colonize and potentially outcompete native species, potentially altering the restored ecosystem's native balance.", "Species that emerge in an ecosystem during restoration efforts, not intentionally planted or promoted by the restoration strategy, but can potentially outcompete or alter the community's composition.", "Species that are not intentionally seeded or promoted during restoration efforts, yet can still colonize and become established in the restored ecosystem, potentially altering its ecological integrity."], "california grasslands": ["Ecosystems of temperate Mediterranean climate regions, characterized by a mix of native and non-native plant species, where targeted restoration efforts may unintentionally promote the establishment of invasive non-native species, highlighting the importance of considering the complex interactions between native and non-native species in restoration strategies.", "A type of temperate ecosystem characterized by a mix of native vegetation, predominantly perennial grasses and wildflowers, which, when intentionally restored, may inadvertently create a pathway for non-native species to establish themselves, underscoring the importance of considering unintended consequences in restoration strategies.", "Semi-arid regions dominated by perennial grasses and forbs, characterized by a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters, and often exploited for agriculture and conservation efforts.", "A type of temperate ecosystem characterized by a diverse array of native flora, typically dominated by perennial grasses and wildflowers, where restoration efforts can inadvertently favor the establishment of non-native species if priority is given to certain plant groups over others.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by temperate climates, nutrient-rich soils, and a mix of native grasses and wildflowers that are often heavily influenced by human activity and susceptible to invasion by non-native species."]}
