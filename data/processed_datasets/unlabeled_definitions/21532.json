fluctuate.", "A marine animal characterized by its colonial growth pattern and ability to thrive in a variety of environments, from shallow coastal waters to areas with fluctuating salinity levels.", "A type of colonial marine animal characterized by its intricate, star-shaped colonies, which can thrive in a range of aquatic environments and often outcompete native species for space and resources.", "A type of colonial marine animal that forms star-shaped aggregations on underwater surfaces, typically inhabiting areas with moderate salinity levels, and is well adapted to coexist with other species, but can be outcompeted for space by certain invasive competitors."], "sea squirts": ["Aquatic colonial animals that attach to surfaces, exhibit complex body structures, and engage in competition for space, often displaying adaptability and tolerance to varying environmental conditions.", "Aquatic creatures that form colonies by adhering to underwater surfaces, often exhibiting a unique life cycle characterized by alternating generations of free-swimming and sessile forms, with some species having a propensity to outcompete others for space and resources in their ecological niches.", "Colony-forming, sessile marine animals that filter feed on plankton and small organisms, often competitively vieing for space and resources with native species in their invasive range.", "Organisms that live in colonies, secrete a gelatinous coating, and have a unique life cycle that involves an initial stage as a free-swimming larva, followed by settlement and metamorphosis into a sessile adult form, often attached to a substrate such as a rock or a man-made object in a marine environment.", "Colonial, filter-feeding, marine animals that form symbiotic clusters on underwater surfaces, often outcompeting native species for space."], "settlement": ["The process of an organism colonizing a new area or surface, marking the beginning of a potentially long-term presence, often involving a struggle for resources and space with other organisms.", "The establishment of a species' presence and growth in a new area, often accompanied by competition with other species for limited resources such as space, leading to a dynamic interplay that shapes the community's structure and function.", "The process by which a colonial marine organism arrives at and becomes established on a new surface, often competing with existing species for space and resources.", "The process by which colonizing organisms establish a presence in a new area, often outcompeting existing inhabitants for limited resources such as space, food, or light, ultimately determining the composition and dynamics of the local ecosystem.", "The process by which organisms, particularly colonial species, establish a new location as their home, often competing with other species for resources and space, thereby shaping the structure and composition of their environment."], "marine fouling": ["The process by which non-indigenous aquatic organisms, often introduced through human activity, overgrow or outcompete native species for space and resources on underwater surfaces, resulting in altered ecological dynamics and potentially threatening native species' persistence.", "The process by which non-indigenous or invasive aquatic organisms, such as colonial sea squirts, rapidly colonize and dominate surfaces in their new environment, potentially outcompeting native species for space and resources.", "The process by which a species colonizes and dominates available space on or beneath the ocean's surface, often displacing native inhabitants and altering the ecological balance, exemplified by the displacement of the native star tunicate by the invasive violet tunicate in The Netherlands.", "The process by which certain aquatic organisms, often non-indigenous species, form unsolicited aggregations on underwater surfaces, potentially disrupting the balance of local ecosystems and compromising the structure of artificial habitats, as witnessed in the competition for space between colonial sea squirts in the Netherlands.", "The unwanted colonization and competition for space among organisms that thrive on or in aquatic environments, often leading to modifications of the ecosystem and potentially altering the balance between native and non-native species."], "botryllus": ["A type of
