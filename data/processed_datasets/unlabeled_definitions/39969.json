eventually outcompeting invasive species and creating a dense canopy cover.", "A process by which a small, well-established area of native vegetation is deliberately protected and nurtured, with the goal of fostering a gradual, long-term expansion of its canopy cover, which can help to shade out invasive species and promote a more balanced ecosystem over time.", "The focused introduction of a small, intense concentration of dense vegetation, often with a mix of species, to catalyze ecological recovery and suppression of invasive species in a degraded or degraded forest ecosystem, with the potential to create a \"hub\" for further growth and diversification.", "The deliberate introduction of a specific set of vegetation elements, designed to accelerate a forest's structural development, often in a targeted manner to create a localized focal point for natural regeneration, while simultaneously reducing invasive species presence through gradual shading."], "tree cover": ["The measure of the area in which dense, branching vegetation, often above a certain height, casts shade and influences the local environment, thereby potentially altering the composition of other plant species present.", "The degree to which the upper layer of a vegetation community is obscured by a dense arrangement of woody stems, providing shade and potentially limiting the growth of certain species.", "The percentage of spatial area aboveground that is obstructed by a thickened aggregate of woody vegetation, serving as a protective layer for the soil, flora, and fauna, and characteristically marked
