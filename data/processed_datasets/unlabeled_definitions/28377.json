or decaying vegetation.", "In tropical ecosystems, species of ants that are commonly found burrowing in soil, leaf litter, or decaying plant material, playing a crucial role in decomposing organic matter and maintaining soil health, often exhibiting a high degree of specialization in their habitat and dietary preferences.", "Ant species that inhabit and thrive in areas with rich organic matter, such as leaf litter, soil, and decomposing plant matter, which are typically found in shaded and diverse ecosystems, including tropical forests and agroforestry systems, where they play a crucial role in nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning.", "Ant species that inhabit areas with dense leaf litter, soil, or other vegetation substrates, often displaying ecological adaptations allowing them to thrive in environments characterized by moderate to high humidity, rich soil composition, and shade, typical of tropical forest floors.", "Ants that thrive in shaded environments with complex litter layers, where they navigate through dense undergrowth and forage for food amidst decomposing organic matter, often forming close associations with plant roots and leaf litter."], "arboreal ants": ["Ants that inhabit the vertical layers of a tropical forest ecosystem, where their colonies can thrive amidst the complex network of branches, leaves, and flowers, often living in symbiosis with the trees that provide them with food, shelter, and protection.", "Ant species that inhabit and thrive in the upper layers of dense, vertically structured ecosystems, often exploiting the unique microhabitats and resources found in canopies and tree crowns, and contributing to the biodiversity and ecological functionality of these environments.", "Species of ants that thrive in environments characterized by a diverse vertical structure, where multiple layers of vegetation create a complex network of ecological niches, allowing them to exploit a wide range of food sources, shelter, and breeding opportunities.", "Ants that dwell in the upper layers of a habitat, inhabiting structures that resemble the branching canopy of a forest, often relying on the support of vegetation or tree-like plants to access food and shelter.", "Species of ants that thrive in tree-dwelling environments, often living in the canopy, leaf litter, or even among the root systems of certain plant species, particularly those with complex canopies or a mix of tree species, which provide a diverse array of microhabitats and sheltered areas."], "agroecosystem": ["A managed ecological system where cultivated crops are integrated with native vegetation, creating a complex network of ecological interactions that support a diverse range of species, including those that inhabit the soil, leaf litter, and canopy, thereby preserving the natural balance of a tropical forest.", "An ecosystem wherein human activity and land use have created a complex network of vegetation structures, soil layers, and microhabitats that mimic the natural diversity of a native habitat, providing a unique blend of environmental conditions that support a wide range of species, particularly those that inhabit the soil, leaf litter, or canopy of tropical forests.", "A symbiotic and diverse network of ecological relationships, where human activities such as cultivation and management of crops coexist with and facilitate the flourishing of native species, like those of the Atlantic Forest region, thereby fostering a rich tapestry of biodiversity.", "A type of ecological complex that arises from the intentional or accidental harmonization of human activities with the natural environment, resulting in a network of relationships between organisms and their physical surroundings that is characterized by a balance between productive and destructive processes, and where the structure and diversity of the environment are shaped by the presence and interactions of a diverse array of species, including those that are adapted to soil, leaf litter, or canopy habitats.", "A type of human-altered landscape that maintains a complex web of interacting components, fostering a dynamic equilibrium between agriculture, vegetation, and wildlife, with the result being a thriving and diverse ecosystem that supports multiple species and ecological processes."], "erythrina": ["A tall, spreading canopy that provides a habitat for a diverse array of forest-dwelling ants, with its slender branches and broad leaves offering shelter and sustenance for these insects.", "A canopy-forming tree species characterized by its ability to provide a shaded and structurally complex environment, thereby supporting a rich and diverse array of sub-canopy arthropods, particularly ants.", "A
