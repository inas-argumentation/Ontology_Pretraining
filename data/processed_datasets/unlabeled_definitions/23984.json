other plants to thrive, or a competitive presence, crowding out native species, depending on the ecosystem it invades.", "A nitrogen-fixing legume that can play a dual role in native ecosystems, sometimes acting as a facilitator, allowing other species to thrive by creating a favorable environment, and at other times acting as a competitor, stifling the growth of other plants through competition for resources.", "A nitrogen-fixing legume that can play both benevolent and competitive roles in shaping the composition of native plant communities, its impact varying depending on the type of vegetation it colonizes.", "A type of nitrogen-fixing invasive plant species that can play a dual role in ecosystems, either serving as a facilitative \"nurse\" for other species or acting as a competitive threat, depending on the specific habitat and ecological context."], "great plains": ["A vast region of mixed grasslands, prairies, and sparse vegetation zones characterized by a dynamic interplay between native and non-native plant species, where the presence of nitrogen-fixing legumes can significantly impact local ecosystems and alter the balance of biodiversity over time.", "A vast and varied expanse of landscape characterized by sparse vegetation, nutrient-poor soils, and a mix of native grasses and wildflowers, where the presence of a nitrogen-fixing, non-native legume can have a profound impact on the distribution and abundance of native and exotic plant species.", "A vast and diverse region of grasslands and prairies characterized by a shared climate, geology, and ecological history, often harboring a unique assemblage of native plant species that are adapted to the area's native conditions, and are susceptible to influences from introduced species such as Melilotus officinalis, which can have either facilitative or competitive effects on native vegetation, dependent on the specific ecosystem and vegetation type.", "A vast, sprawling region of mixed grasslands and prairies characterized by unpredictable weather patterns and a rich diversity of flora and fauna, often shaped by the converging forces of geological history and human activities.", "A vast, ecologically diverse region characterized by native grasslands, rugged badlands formations, and scattered forests, where the influence of invasive legumes can have profound effects on the native

involves the interaction between species and their shared environment.", "A subtle and far-reaching influence that can stem from the presence of an invasive species, whereby its impact on the environment can indirectly benefit or harm other plants, creating a chain reaction that can have lasting effects on the ecosystem.", "A phenomenon where the presence or absence of a species has a profound impact on the ecosystem, influencing the dynamics of other organisms in a manner that is not immediately apparent, yet has far-reaching consequences that unfold over time.", "The influence of a foreign presence on the ecosystem that is mediated by its impact on other species or environmental factors, ultimately altering the dynamics of the community, without being a direct causal agent.",

far-reaching consequences, even if the species itself is no longer present."], "nitrogen-fixation": ["The process by which certain plants, often foreign to a given ecosystem, take in atmospheric gases and convert them into a nutrient-rich form that benefits their own growth and that of surrounding vegetation, potentially altering the delicate balance of the native plant community.", "The process by
