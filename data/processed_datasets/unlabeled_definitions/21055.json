{"longitudinal distribution": ["The pattern of spatial occupation or abundance of a species along a watercourse, influenced by factors such as habitat type, gradient, and interactions with other species, resulting in distinct ecological niches and communities.", "The pattern of abundance or presence of a species along a stream or river, where the distance downstream or upstream is a key factor in determining the species' distribution and density.", "The pattern of how different species occupy different segments of a stream or river, often influenced by factors such as the characteristics of the aquatic environment, the introduction of non-native species, and the adaptability of the native species, which can result in changes to the distribution of fish populations along the length of the waterway.", "The pattern of fish species colonization and abundance along a stream's gradient, from upstream to downstream sections, which can be influenced by various ecological factors, such as water flow, vegetation, and presence of introduced species, resulting in differences in species density and distribution.", "The pattern of a species' spatial arrangement along a watercourse, with different segments of the stream inhabited by distinct species or varying abundances, potentially influenced by the ecological interactions and competition between introduced and native populations."], "biological invasion-brown trout": ["The introduction of a non-native species, originally from Europe, into Japanese freshwater ecosystems, which has since altered the natural habitat and competitive dynamics of native fish populations, potentially disrupting the balance of the ecosystem.", "The phenomenon where a non-native species, often introduced through human activity, displaces or competes with native species for habitat and resources in a specific ecosystem, resulting in changes to the community's structure and dynamics.", "The arrival and establishment of a non-native fish species in a stream or river, which can lead to changes in the native ecosystem, often resulting in displacement of native species by the introduced species, especially in areas with low gradient and slower currents.", "The intentional or unintentional movement of a non-native fish species into an ecosystem, resulting in competition for resources and potential displacement of indigenous species, ultimately altering the native ecological balance.", "The establishment and spread of a non-native fish species in a new aquatic environment, potentially leading to displacement and competitive exclusion of native fish populations."], "masu salmon": ["A migratory fish species native to certain Japanese rivers, often found in lower reaches of streams where it competes with introduced trout species for habitat and resources.", "A native Pacific salmonid species, inhabiting low-gradient stream environments, where its populations are often negatively impacted by the introduction of invasive trout species, resulting in altered distribution patterns and habitat competition.", "A species of Pacific salmon characterized by its native habitation in certain Japanese waters, where its populations often coexist with introduced brown trout, and tend to have lower densities in comparison, particularly in areas dominated by these invasive trout.", "A species of Pacific salmonid fish native to Japan, characterized by its tendency to occupy downstream sections of freshwater streams, often coexisting with introduced brown trout species, but typically with lower population densities.", "A species of Pacific salmon that, when introduced to new habitats, tends to congregate in lower reaches of streams and rivers, often sharing territory with invasive trout species."]}
