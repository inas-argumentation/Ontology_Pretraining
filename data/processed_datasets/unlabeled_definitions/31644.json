dogs in Hokkaido, Japan.", "The process of analyzing the subtle differences in the chemical makeup of organic matter to determine its dietary sources and environmental pathways, providing valuable insights into the food habits and ecological niches of species, such as identifying the presence of crop-based or insect-based diets."], "feeding habits": ["The manner in which an organism procures and consumes its sustenance, which can be influenced by its environment, dietary preferences, and availability of resources.", "The dietary patterns and food procurement behaviors of a species, encompassing the types, sources, and frequencies of consumption, as well as the adaptation of these habits to their environmental niche and ecological relationships.", "The typical pattern of consumption or foraging behavior exhibited by an animal, encompassing the types and sources of food, time of day or season, and spatial distribution of feeding activities, often influenced by ecological and environmental factors.", "The ways in which a species gathers, consumes, and adapts to its preferred dietary components, which can reflect its ecological niche, foraging strategies, and resource availability.", "The regular patterns of food consumption and preference exhibited by a species, including the types of food sources, spatial distribution of food intake, and frequency of feeding, which often influence their ecology and interactions with other species."], "habitat use": ["The area where an animal is found, characterized by its selection of easily accessible food sources and shelter, which influences its presence and behavior.", "The pattern of space occupation and resource exploitation displayed by a species, encompassing the selection of environments, use of resources, and coexistence with other species, which collectively influence its survival and reproduction.", "The specific areas where an organism tends to frequent in search of sustenance, shelter, and suitable environmental conditions, reflecting its adaptations to exploit available resources and avoid competition.", "The specific locations and resources within an environment that an animal tends to frequent and utilize for sustenance, shelter, and reproduction, often influenced by factors such as food availability, spatial competition, and predation risk, which ultimately shape its ecological niche.", "The pattern of spatial distribution and utilization of resources, such as food and shelter, that reflects an organism's adaptation to its environment and can vary in response to changes in its availability."]}
