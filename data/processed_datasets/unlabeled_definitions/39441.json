has altered the natural environment, resulting in a diminution of wildlife habitats and a fragmentation of ecosystems, often with limited access to urban amenities."], "domestic refuges": ["Sheltered or secluded areas within a domestic setting that provide a haven for unwanted insects to establish themselves, often hidden from direct sunlight and human disturbance, thereby allowing them to thrive

survival of certain insects or other organisms that would otherwise be deterred by the proximity of human activity or modified environments.", "Areas of a residence or enclosure where insects can rest, shelter, or hide, often providing protection from external environmental conditions, predators, or other ecological pressures.", "Sheltered areas within human dwellings that provide a suitable
