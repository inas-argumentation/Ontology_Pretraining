fluctuations, limited nutrients, and unique microclimates, typically exhibiting a distinct assemblage of species that is shaped by both abiotic and biotic factors.", "A group of plant species that

environmental conditions, with a potential for new species to emerge or persist, influencing the overall composition and resilience of the community.", "A unique ensemble of vegetation types occurring at high elevations, characterized by distinctive composition and dynamics, where environmental pressures and species interactions shape the trajectory of species persistence and colonization, influencing the long-term resilience and adaptability of these fragile ecosystems.", "Communities of vascular plants that thrive in mountainous regions, characterized by a unique combination of environmental pressures, such as extreme temperature fluctuations, limited soil nutrients, and reduced humidity, which shape the composition and diversity of these plant assemblages."], "range filling": ["The process by which vacant ecological niches are gradually occupied by existing species, allowing for an increase in species richness within a community, often driven by changes in environmental conditions.", "The process by which the composition of a community is reorganized through the displacement of dominant species by newcomers, allowing for the expansion of competitors and/or the introduction of new ecological niches, which is facilitated by biotic exchanges with adjacent communities and potentially drives the persistence of original species.", "The process by which new species, often from adjacent or lower-elevation communities, gradually colonize and replace declining or declining-dominant species within an alpine ecosystem, leading to changes in community composition and an overall increase in species richness.", "The process by which species or communities adapt to environmental changes by occupying newly available ecological niches, often through the dispersal and establishment of new individuals, allowing for the expansion of existing populations and potentially leading to increased species diversity.", "The process by which previously vacant ecological niches within a community are increasingly occupied by native species, often driven by changes in environmental conditions, allowing for an increase in overall biodiversity."], "species persistence": ["The capacity of a dominant population to maintain its ecological presence and influence over time, even in the face of environmental changes, allowing for the continued interaction and adaptation with surrounding communities.", "The ability of a particular assemblage of plant life forms to maintain its identity and compositional integrity over time, despite the introduction of novel competitors, climate fluctuations, and other environmental pressures, allowing for a continued coexistence with its original ecological context.", "The capacity of a particular plant population or community to continue to thrive and maintain its presence over time, despite environmental changes or disturbances, by adapting and adjusting to new conditions while preserving its original identity.", "The enduring presence and continued influence of a particular characteristic or identity within a community, despite changes and flux, enabling its potential to adapt and interact with its surroundings, ultimately shaping the community's ecological trajectory.", "The capacity of a plant's ecological niche to be occupied and maintained over time, even as environmental conditions change, thereby enabling the continuation of a specific trait combination that is essential for its survival and adaptation."], "species turnover": ["The process by which changes in community composition occur due to the replacement of dominant species with new, potentially more adaptable or competitive ones, leading to a rearrangement of ecological niches and species interactions, often accompanied by an increase in overall species richness.", "The process by which a community of plant species undergoes a significant change in its composition over time, characterized by the loss of

competitive species, leading to an overall increase in biodiversity and a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."], "extinction debt": ["The accumulation of species that were expected to have gone extinct due to environmental changes, but instead persist in declining populations, holding back the gradual reshaping of ecosystems and awaiting the point at which their numbers finally plummet, potentially
