establishing itself in a wide range of environments, posing a significant threat to both human livelihoods and biodiversity.", "A highly adaptable and rapidly spreading terrestrial mammal, introduced to new regions through human activity, which can significantly impact local ecosystems and economies through its voracious appetite, destructive behavior, and potential to vector disease, requiring careful management and containment to mitigate its effects.", "A highly adaptable and increasingly widespread non-native mammal, originally introduced to new regions through human activity, and now rapidly expanding its range, requiring strategic management to balance competing concerns of agriculture, environmental protection, and recreational hunting.", "A species of wild omnivore, introduced
