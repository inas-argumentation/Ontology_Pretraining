role as a consumer of other organisms, and influencing the flow of energy and nutrients through the food web.", "The position an organism occupies in the ecological hierarchy, indicating its primary source of energy and nutrients, and which determines its impact on other organisms in the food web.", "The ranking or layer of an ecosystem based on the way energy is transferred from one organism to another, with each level characterized by a specific pattern of consumption, growth, and sustenance, where individuals may occupy distinct positions depending on their feeding habits, size, and

develops, potentially leading to changes in its role within an ecosystem, such as shifting from a competitor to a predator.", "The developmental process by which an individual's position within a food chain undergoes a significant change as they mature, driven by adjustments to their diet and predatory habits, ultimately influencing the dynamics of the invaded ecosystem.", "The gradual development of complex ecological roles and relationships within an organism as it grows and matures, potentially leading to changes in its position within a food web and interactions with other species.", "The
