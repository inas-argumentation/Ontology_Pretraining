recreational purposes, and characterized by the presence of water-holding structures that can serve as habitats for various insect species.", "A managed outdoor space in a populated area, typically featuring a mix of vegetation and built structures, which can include water-holding containers and manmade features that potentially attract and harbor insect vectors of human diseases.", "A

residential areas, and potentially harboring diverse microhabitats that can support a range of aquatic invertebrates and insects."], "culex": ["A common genus of mosquitoes found in diverse aquatic habitats, often thriving in tranquil, vegetation-filled environments where water is present, but not exclusively reliant on them for survival.", "Small, usually unwanted, residents that thrive in humid, plant-filled environments, but are not necessarily the main attraction for disease-carrying pests.", "A group of insects that often dominate the ecosystem of urban botanical gardens in tropical regions, serving as a indicator species of a balanced environment, but also providing a backdrop for more notorious pests to thrive in a subtle, understated manner.", "Small, water-loving insects that thrive in aquatic environments, often found in abundance alongside larger, more invasive species that pose a threat to human health.", "A group of mosquitoes that thrive in unexpected crevices, outcompeting more notorious species for dominance in urban environments, and play a surprisingly important yet often overlooked role in the ecosystem."], "dengue vector": ["Mosquito species that play a crucial role in the transmission of dengue fever, specifically those that are capable of surviving and reproducing in environments closely tied to human habitation, such as urban gardens and residential areas, while being influenced by factors like water-holding plant axils and insecticides.", "A certain species of mosquito that plays a crucial role in transmitting a highly prevalent and potentially life-threatening tropical disease, and is often found in urban environments, particularly in areas where vegetation, such as bromeliads, is abundant, but is not necessarily dependent on these plants as a breeding ground.", "A mosquito species that has the ability to transmit the dengue fever virus to humans, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, and is often associated with urban environments and human-made containers, but may not be as common in certain types of natural habitats such as bromeliads.", "Species of mosquitoes that, when present in specific environmental settings, can facilitate the transmission of a certain disease, thereby posing a public health risk, particularly in urban areas where human habitation is close to vectors' breeding habitats.", "A specific type of mosquito that has the ability to spread a debilitating disease, typically found in areas with poor sanitation and living conditions, often thriving in seemingly
