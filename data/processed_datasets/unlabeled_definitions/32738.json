events, ultimately leading to a uniform occupation of the environment.", "The process where the spatial distribution of populations is solely determined by demographic factors such as demographic stochasticity and immigration fluxes, without the influence of any underlying preference for specific habitats, leading to patterns of population size and distribution that are similar to those observed in the presence of habitat preference, but with subtle differences in their invasibility properties.", "A scenario in which the spatial distribution of species is solely determined by demographic stochasticity and immigration fluxes, with no consideration for any environmental factors or preferences, resulting in a uniform and homogeneous competition pattern.", "The absence of any specific advantages or disadvantages in the spatial distribution of individuals, leading to a lack of distinct spatial niches and a uniform competition for resources.", "The situation in which the competitive interactions between species are uninfluenced by factors such as spatial distribution and preferred habitats, resulting in a homogenized competition dynamic."], "spatial niches": ["A microcosmic configuration of spatially-separated regions where species exhibit distinct demographic responses, allowing for the coexistence of multiple species within a shared habitat.", "The concept of spatial niches refers to the phenomenon where the presence of preferred habitats or microenvironments enables species to coexist and thrive in the same ecological space by occupying distinct regions, thereby reducing competition for resources and increasing the chances of persistence.", "Regions where the distribution of a species' presence or abundance is significantly influenced by their inherent preferences for certain environments or resources, leading to the creation of distinct and resilient ecological configurations.", "The distinct microclimatic or ecological conditions that develop within a shared habitat due to the presence of multiple species, leading to a non-uniform distribution of individuals among different regions, thereby creating opportunities for coexistence and specialization.", "The concept refers to the unique spatial configurations that arise from species interactions, where each species occupies a specific location or zone within a shared environment, influenced by their individual preferences for resources, demographics, and ecological processes."], "habitat preference": ["The tendency for a species to aggregate in specific locations or environments, where the characteristics of those areas enhance the species' ability to survive, reproduce, and thrive, potentially leading to the formation of spatially segregated populations.", "The tendency of species to thrive in specific regions or microhabitats, where their demographic and ecological characteristics are optimally suited, thereby conferring a competitive advantage over other species.", "The propensity of a species to disproportionately occupy and thrive in specific micro-environments, leading to a skewed distribution of population sizes and a reduction in interspecies competition.", "The tendency of an organism to inhabit specific areas with characteristics that provide optimal environmental conditions for its survival and reproduction, leading to a concentration of its population in these areas and a separation from other species that do not share the same preferences.", "A biological adaptation that guides an organism's spatial distribution and population dynamics, favoring specific environments and resources that suit its survival and reproduction, thereby creating spatial niches and potentially influencing the outcome of interspecific

habitat.", "A dynamic system where environmental influences on population distributions are solely attributed to demographic fluctuations and immigration patterns, with no consideration for species-specific adaptations or preferences.", "A theoretical framework that assumes the absence of habitat-specific advantages or disadvantages between competing species, leading to a homogeneous
