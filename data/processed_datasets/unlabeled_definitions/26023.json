displaying a strong preference for adult conspecifics over other suitable habitats.", "A small, filter-feeding marine mollusk that thrives in estuarine environments, with a unique life cycle that includes a preference for settling in coastal habitats with abundant, sheltered spaces, where it can find protection from predators and optimal conditions for growth and development.", "A species of bivalve mollusk that thrives in estuarine environments, often finding refuge in dense algae beds where it can avoid predators and recruit successfully, exhibiting a unique preference for its own kind

strong preference for living among its own adult counterparts."], "caulerpa taxfolia": ["A type of invasive, non-native aquatic plant with a reputation for dominating its environment, which, surprisingly, can provide a safe haven for native marine animals to settle and grow, thereby altering the dynamics of the ecosystem.", "A type of invasive, non-native marine algae that can provide a safe haven for native bivalve species, allowing them to recruit and thrive in environments where they may otherwise be vulnerable to predation.", "A invasive marine plant with a tendency to dominate temperate estuaries worldwide, providing a refuge from predators and potentially enhancing the recruitment of native bivalves by offering a favorable habitat choice, although its long-term ecological impacts remain uncertain.", "A type of invasive marine algae that has been known to alter the dynamics of estuarine ecosystems by providing a sanctuary for native bivalve species, thereby enhancing their recruitment and survival rates.", "A ubiquitous, invasive aquatic plant species that has taken over coastal habitats worldwide, and when present in these areas, can offer a sanctuary to native marine animals, providing them protection from predators and encouraging their growth and reproduction."], "sydney cockle": ["A type of native bivalve that thrives in estuarine environments, often seeking out areas with complex habitats and potential refuges from predation, where its young can settle and grow safely.", "A small, coastal bivalve mollusk that thrives in the company of its elders, and has a predilection for sheltered environments where it can rest easy, free from the threat of hungry predators.", "A bivalve species native to certain eastern Australian estuaries, known for its preference for inhabiting areas with existing adult populations and structures, where it can benefit from increased protection from predators.", "A type of saltwater bivalve mollusk that is native to eastern Australian estuaries, known for its affinity towards establishing itself in areas with dense macrophyte cover, likely due to the protective refuge it provides from predation and favorable habitat conditions.", "A small, burrowing marine bivalve mollusk native to eastern Australian estuaries, which tends to congregate and thrive in dense vegetation, leveraging the protection of this habitat to escape predation and focus on establishing its populations."], "refuge from predation": ["A habitat or surface that provides a safe environment for young or vulnerable individuals to settle, grow, and develop without being consumed or damaged by predators.", "A safe and protected environment where vulnerable individuals can settle and grow without being consumed by predators, allowing them to avoid harm and increase their chances of survival and establishment.", "A secure environment that provides a safe haven from being preyed upon, allowing vulnerable individuals to develop and establish themselves without the constant threat of being consumed by predators.", "An area or habitat that offers protection and concealment to vulnerable individuals, such as juveniles or larvae, from predators, thereby increasing their chances of survival, growth, and successful establishment in a new environment.", "A habitat or microenvironment that provides temporary or long-term protection from consumption by natural predators, thereby allowing vulnerable individuals to survive, grow, and potentially thrive."], "seagrasses": ["Tall, coastal aquatic plants that provide shelter and protection to certain marine species, allowing them to thrive in environments where they might otherwise be vulnerable to predators.", "Submerged marine vegetation that provides a

species.", "Submerged, coastal vegetation consisting of dense arrays of slender, aquatic shoots that provide complex habitats for a diverse range of marine invertebrates and fish, often serving as refuges from predation and altering local ecological dynamics.", "Underwater plant communities that provide shelter and structural complexity, supporting a diverse array of infaunal species, and serving as a refuge from predators, which can lead to enhanced recruitment and survival rates for certain native bivalve species.", "A type of aquatic vegetation characterized by its ability to provide a haven for bivalve larvae, while also being a viable option for settlement and growth."], "habitat choice": ["The process by which early life stages of a species select specific microhabitats

settlement and survival.", "The selective attachment or selection of a location by organisms, influenced by factors such as predation pressure, resource availability, and substrate characteristics, which in turn affects their survival and establishment.", "The process by which a species selectively occupies or avoids particular environmental conditions or structures, often driven by factors such as predation pressure, resource availability, or physiological requirements, which ultimately influences the distribution and abundance of the species.", "The process by which early life stages of an organism select specific environments or microhabitats within a particular setting, often based on factors such as protection from predation, availability of food or resources, or suitable conditions for growth and development.", "The selection of a specific location or environment that provides optimal conditions for growth, survival, and development, often driven by factors such as availability of food, shelter, or protection from predators."]}
