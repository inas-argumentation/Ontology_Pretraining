{"hand-collecting": ["The intentional removal of individual organisms from a wild population for population management or control, often requiring a significant amount of time and effort to collect a substantial proportion of the population, but occasionally achieving substantial reductions in abundance.", "The act of physically removing a specific population of invasive organisms, often through manual search and capture, in an effort to control their abundance and mitigate their ecological impact.", "The manual removal or gathering of a specific non-native species by individuals, often in an attempt to mitigate the impact of invasive populations on local ecosystems.", "The removal of a target species from a specific area through a manual and targeted effort, often involving the detection and capture of individual animals by trained or motivated individuals.", "The practice of manually and selectively removing a specific species from its habitat, often targeting specific life stages or individuals, in an attempt to manage or control its population."], "demography": ["The study of the birth, growth, and survival patterns of a species, focusing on the ways in which human intervention can alter these processes and, in turn, shape the overall population dynamics and distribution of the species.", "The study of the size and structure of a population, including the factors that influence the movement, distribution, and persistence of individuals within it, as exemplified by the measurement of adult-to-subadult ratios in a cane toad population.", "The study of the complex dynamics between a species' population size, age structure, and movement patterns, often revealing the subtle balance between growth, decline, and extinction in a rapidly changing environment.", "The study of the size and structure of a population, encompassing the distribution of its various life stages, sizes, and characteristics across space and time, which is essential for understanding its ecological impact and potential for management or control.", "The study of the characteristics and dynamics of a population, including its size, age structure, and reproductive behavior, as revealed through the ebb and flow of life stages, migration patterns, and removals by external factors, providing insight into the complex and often unpredictable trajectories of a species' spread and persistence."]}
