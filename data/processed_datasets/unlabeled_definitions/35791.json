contribution of certain variables to reduce noise or irrelevant information, allowing for a more accurate and focused representation of a species' distribution.", "The process of selectively focusing on specific geographic scales or features to refine the precision of environmental models, thereby reducing noise and enhancing the accuracy of predictions by minimizing the influence of non-relevant variables.", "The process of refining a model's predictive power by deliberately restricting the range of environmental factors it takes into account, allowing it to focus on the most important
