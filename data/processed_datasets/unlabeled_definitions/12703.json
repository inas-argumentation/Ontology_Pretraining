{"passive surveillance": ["The spontaneous and unintentional sharing of information about pest or disease sightings by members of the general public, often without explicit prompting or formal training, which can contribute to the early detection and management of invasive species.", "The incidental and unsolicited reporting of information about pest and disease presence by members of the general public, often occurring through chance encounters or observations, and subsequently collected and utilized by management agencies for the purpose of invasive species management.", "The incidental and unsolicited provision of information by members of the general public regarding the presence or activity of pests or diseases, often resulting from random encounters or observations that may not be actively sought or promoted by authorities or agencies, but can potentially lead to early detection and informed management of invasive species.", "The spontaneous reporting of information about the presence of pests or diseases, often driven by chance encounters, and relies on the initiative and vigilance of individuals or groups within the community.", "The unsolicited and serendipitous provision of information by individuals about the presence of pests or diseases, often resulting from chance encounters or observations, which can provide valuable insights for early detection and management of invasive species."], "community surveillance": ["The voluntary and often unintentional reporting of potentially invasive species or pest-disease information by members of the public, facilitated by their everyday activities and interactions with the environment, which can provide valuable insights for management and control efforts.", "The spontaneous provision of observational data by the general public, often through unplanned encounters, that can aid in the early detection and management of invasive species.", "The collective reporting of observations and information by members of the public regarding the presence, spread, or impact of invasive species, often arising from unplanned interactions or chance encounters.", "The collective gathering and reporting of information about a specific issue or problem, often driven by spontaneous or chance encounters, by various individuals or groups outside of traditional official channels, which can contribute to early detection and mitigation.", "The collaborative effort of a collective entity to monitor and report on the presence or absence of a specific entity or issue, often driven by chance encounters, informal networks, and voluntary contributions, which can ultimately inform decision-making and management strategies."], "cost-benefit analysis": ["The systematic evaluation of the value of information generated by community-led initiatives, examining the relative importance of factors such as timeliness, accuracy, and resource allocation in determining the overall utility of that information in managing invasive species.", "The systematic evaluation of the returns and investments involved in relying on the public to report new invasive species sightings, aimed at determining the optimal allocation of resources to maximize the benefits of this community-based information gathering method.", "The systematic process of weighing the financial and non-financial implications of different approaches to encourage public reporting of invasive species, with the goal of identifying the most effective and resource-efficient methods to optimize the value of community contributions to invasive species management.", "The systematic evaluation of the relationship between the tangible and intangible returns generated by a particular approach to managing invasive species, against the resources invested in that approach, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the utilization of community-driven surveillance opportunities to maximize benefits while minimizing costs.", "A systematic evaluation of the financial and informational consequences of collecting and acting on data reported by the public about invasive species, aimed at identifying the most effective and resource-efficient ways to leverage this information in order to mitigate the economic and ecological impacts of these species."], "cost-effectiveness": ["The ability of a public reporting mechanism to yield meaningful and timely information about invasive species, while minimizing the resources required to achieve and utilize that information, ultimately allowing for more efficient and effective management decisions.", "The alignment of resources with reporting outcomes to maximize savings and optimize management programs, by leveraging the collective observations of a community in the early detection and control of invasive species.", "The allocation of resources to achieve a desired outcome in the most advantageous manner, taking into account the relative value of early detection in invasive species management, where the timely and accurate reporting of new incursions can lead to significant cost savings and optimize the use of surveillance opportunities provided by the public.", "The ability to achieve desired outcomes in invasive species management with a minimal allocation of resources, where the value of reported information from the public is maximized, and the likelihood of early detection and effective management is optimized.", "The ability of an initiative to generate a desired outcome while minimizing the resources expended, specifically in a context where community involvement is crucial for early detection and subsequent management of invasive species."]}
