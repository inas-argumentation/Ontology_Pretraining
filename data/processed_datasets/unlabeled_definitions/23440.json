impact plant fitness and growth, making it essential for plants to develop strategies for coping with water scarcity.", "Regions characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, where plants have evolved to cope with periodic drought, thereby distinguishing those that thrive under such conditions from those that struggle to survive.", "A type of climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, with drought periods being a common and crucial factor in shaping the ecological dynamics of plant populations and influencing the success of invasive species.", "A climate characterized by warm to hot summers and mild winters, with pronounced drought periods during the growing season, where vegetation has evolved to adapt to these conditions through specialized physiological traits such as deep roots and reduced water loss, and where the potential for plant invasions is heightened by the tolerance of non-native species to these arid conditions.", "Regions with a unique blend of intense sunshine, dry summers, and mild winters, characterized by vegetation adapted to conserve water and withstand frequent droughts, often accompanied by a rich plant diversity and a propensity for certain species to become invasive in new environments."], "alien invasive species": ["Plants that thrive in environments where they were not originally native, outcompeting indigenous species for resources and space, often exhibiting exceptional resilience to adverse conditions such as drought, and have the capacity to establish and spread rapidly.", "A non-native plant that, despite being able to tolerate drought and stress, lacks certain adaptive traits and competitive capacities that would enable it to thrive in its native ecosystem, but has instead found success in a new environment where it can outcompete native species and alter the ecosystem's dynamics.", "A type of non-native plant that, due to its unique physiological characteristics, can thrive in a Mediterranean-type climate marked by drought, ultimately outcompeting native species for resources and altering the local ecosystem's dynamics.", "A non-native plant
