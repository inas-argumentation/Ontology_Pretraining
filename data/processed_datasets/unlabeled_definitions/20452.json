{"biome shift": ["The process by which a plant species occupying a specific set of environmental conditions and ecosystems in its native habitat is able to adapt to and thrive in a novel range, characterized by distinct ecological conditions and associated ecosystems, potentially resulting in a new or altered distribution pattern.", "The transformation of an organism's ecological niche that enables it to thrive in a novel environment, often facilitated by subtle adaptations to temperature, humidity, and other abiotic factors, resulting in its ability to occupy a distinct ecological zone with characteristics different from those in its original habitat.", "A fundamental alteration in the ecological affinity of a non-native plant species, resulting from its introduction to a novel environment, where it must adapt to new conditions to thrive, potentially leading to changes in its population dynamics, distribution, and impact on the receiving ecosystem.", "A phenomenon in which a plant species adapts to occupy a novel ecological environment that diverges significantly from its native habitat in terms of climate, vegetation structure, and environmental conditions, allowing it to thrive and potentially outcompete native species for resources.", "The phenomenon where a plant species occupying a distinct ecological environment in its native range is able to adapt and thrive in a novel environment with a different combination of climate conditions and community structure, potentially leading to the establishment of a self-sustaining population."], "range": ["The area encompassing the preferred environmental conditions, including climate and biotic settings, that a species has adapted to occupy and thrive in.", "The region or territory in which a particular organism or species is found, including the specific climatic and environmental conditions it inhabits and to which it has adapted, thereby shaping its characteristics and behavior.", "The zone of suitable environmental conditions and ecological interactions within which a species is naturally found or has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced, characterizing its geographic extent and potential for expansion or contraction.", "The geographical scope over which an organism's ecological requirements, such as climate and environmental conditions, are satisfied, thus influencing its distribution and population dynamics.", "The territory or domain in which a species is able to thrive and occupy, encompassing its ecological parameters and environmental conditions, thereby defining the limits within which it can persist and adapt."], "realized niche": ["The specific combination of environmental conditions and biotic factors that a species actually experiences and adapts to in its given range, regardless of its potential or maximum capabilities.", "The specific environmental conditions and ecosystems in which a species actually grows and thrives, as shaped by historical evolutionary pressures and current ecological interactions, which may differ from its theoretical or predicted range based on abiotic factors.", "The actual environmental conditions and ecological role occupied by a species in a particular region, reflecting the integration of its physiological adaptations, evolutionary history, and interactions with other species, which can lead to differences in its presence, abundance, and population dynamics between its native and introduced ranges.", "The ecological space where a species actually occupies and competes for resources, as opposed to its potential range, shaped by environmental conditions and interactions with other organisms.", "The specific ecological environment and conditions that an organism occupies and exploits in its natural or introduced range, encompassing the combination of climate, soil, vegetation, and other factors that support its survival, growth, and reproduction."], "residence time": ["The period of time that has elapsed since a non-native species first established itself in a new environment, during which it has been allowed to evolve and adapt to its surroundings, influencing its likelihood of successful invasion and potential impacts on the native ecosystem.", "The length of time a non-native plant species spends in its new environment before establishing a stable presence and spread, with longer periods often corresponding to greater adaptability and ability to thrive in altered climatic and biome conditions.", "The time elapsed since a species has arrived in a new region, during which it has been exposed to local environmental conditions, potentially adapting to or modifying its habits to successfully occupy the area.", "The duration of time a non-native plant species has spent in a particular environment, where it has had the opportunity to adapt to local conditions and potentially modify its ecological characteristics.", "The period over which a non-native plant species has been present in a region, during which it has had the opportunity to adapt to local conditions and potentially modify its ecological role, while still having the potential to shift its ecological niche or biome in response to environmental pressures or new resources."]}
