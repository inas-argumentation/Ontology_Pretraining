extent to which non-native tree species are affected by herbivores, potentially hindering their establishment and success.", "The number of distinct plant species within a given area that, through a shared evolutionary history, have converged on similar morphological and chemical characteristics, making them vulnerable to similar attacks by herbivores that have adapted to feed on native

of those organisms influence the fate and performance of the plants, often resulting in a delicate balance that shapes the ecological landscape.", "The complex and dynamic relationships between the plants of a community and the insects that feed on, and are influenced by, those plants, with the diversity of the plant community influencing the degree of exploitation and interaction between the plants and their insect associates.", "The intricate and dynamic relationships between distinct organisms that inhabit a shared environment, where one party, often with specialized characteristics, exploits and adapts to the physical and chemical traits of another party, thereby influencing the distribution, growth, and success of both.", "The intricate, evolutionary dance between the feeding activities of small, plant-eating animals and the strategies developed by plants to cope with those feeding activities, particularly in ecosystems where native plant diversity influences the effectiveness of these interactions in shaping the fate of non-native plant species.", "The intricate relationships between species that feed on plants and the species that provide their sustenance, shaped by the historical and ecological context of the plant community, where the diverse array of native plants and insects can have a profound impact on the success or failure of non-native plant species."], "phylogenetic relatedness": ["The extent to which the evolutionary history of an organism is reflected in its susceptibility to consumption by herbivores, influenced by the frequency and similarity of past co-evolutionary encounters with other species.", "The measure of the shared evolutionary history and structural similarity between two or more plant species, which influences the likelihood of herbivores exploiting non-native plants that are closely related to their native hosts.", "The degree of shared evolutionary history and biological affinity between species, measured by the similarity in physical characteristics, growth patterns, and adaptive traits, which influences their susceptibility to herbivory by specialized insects and other consumers.", "The degree of shared evolutionary history between organisms, as reflected in their physical and biological characteristics, which can influence the interactions and associations that occur between them.", "The degree to which a non-native plant shares common evolutionary traits with native plants, facilitating the exploitation of that plant by herbivores that have co-evolved with its native relatives."], "insect herbivory": ["The act of tiny, winged consumers exploiting the physical structures of alien organisms for sustenance, typically targeting plants that possess characteristics similar to those of their ancestral hosts.", "The process by which specific, adapted consumers interact with novel, non-native plant species that share similar characteristics to those in their native environment, thereby limiting the establishment and success of the introduced plants.", "The consumption or destruction of plant materials, particularly leaves, by small animals that feed on and degrade plant tissues, which can impact the establishment and success of non-native plant species in communities with diverse native flora.", "The act of animals feeding on plant materials, often exhibiting preference for plants with analogous characteristics to those found in their native environments, thus contributing to a self-reinforcing cycle of ecosystem diversity.", "The process by which certain organisms, often small and winged, feed on plant material as a food source, exhibiting a preference for species that are closely related to those they naturally inhabit, thereby influencing the survival and
