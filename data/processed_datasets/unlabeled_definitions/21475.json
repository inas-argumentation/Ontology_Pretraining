to a shift in the community's composition and potentially altering its ecological dynamics.", "The gradual process by which a dominant species in an ecosystem is outcompeted and eventually replaced by a more advantageous species, which alters the soil's seed bank composition and potentially paves the way for further invasive species to establish themselves.", "The gradual process by which a dominant invasive species is replaced or surpassed by another invasive species in a specific ecological niche, as a result of a combination of factors including altered soil seed bank composition, rapid growth rate, and niche or fitness differences, ultimately leading to a shift in the composition of the dominant invasive species over time.", "The process by which a dominant species in an ecosystem is gradually replaced by another species, resulting in a shift in the ecological balance and altering the composition of the surrounding environment, often facilitated by changes in the soil seed bank and the species' ability to compete for resources."], "niche differentiation": ["The differences in resource acquisition and utilization strategies employed by multiple invasive plant species to occupy and dominate distinct ecological roles within an ecosystem, often resulting in a displacement of one invader by another.", "The phenomenon where two or more dominant species in a given environment exhibit distinct adaptations, ecological preferences, and resource utilization strategies, thereby reducing direct competition and allowing coexistence, even when they share similar environmental requirements.", "The subtle yet significant rearrangement of ecological pathways and resource utilization patterns that occurs when two invasive species, possessing distinct characteristics and adaptability, coexist and compete for dominance in an altered ecosystem.", "The capacity of different plant species to occupy unique and exclusive ecological positions, driven by their distinct characteristics, in which they are able to coexist and outcompete one another for limited resources, ultimately leading to the formation of complex communities.", "The phenomenon where distinct plant species, co-occurring in the same ecosystem, adopt unique strategies to acquire resources, escape competition, or tolerate environmental stressors, resulting in the occupancy of different ecological \"space\" and limiting the overlap between their populations."], "fallopia japonic": ["A sprawling, invasive giant with a propensity to dominate and displace native flora, reshaping the very soil that nurtures it.", "A type of giant herbaceous plant species that can rapidly alter the soil seed bank composition and displace previously established invaders, exhibiting superior competitive ability and the potential to occupy empty niches.", "A large, invasive herbaceous species that can drastically alter the composition and richness of a soil seed bank, potentially paving the way for its own persistence and dominance in a previously invaded ecosystem, and which outcompetes other invaders in its ability to colonize and displace existing vegetation.", "A towering, fast-spreading plant with a relentless ability to alter the underlying ecosystem, supplanting long-established rivals and creating fertile ground for subsequent invaders to take hold, often leaving a lasting legacy in the invaded soil's seed bank.", "A particularly formidable and aggressive vegetation overgrowth that, once established, can rapidly displace native flora and modify the underlying soil seed bank to its advantage, paving the way for further colonization by similarly aggressive species."], "alien plant invasion": ["The phenomenon of a non-native plant species' rapid establishment and proliferation in an ecosystem, often with significant alterations to the native vegetation structure and soil seed bank, thereby creating novel conditions that facilitate further invasions by other non-native or weedy species.", "The establishment and spread of a non-native plant species in a new ecosystem, where the species is able to thrive and outcompete native vegetation, often with significant alterations to the soil seed bank and potentially paving the way for further secondary invasions by other non-native or weedy species.", "The process by which a non-native plant species,

resulting in alterations to the local ecosystem's composition and structure, and potentially leading to the displacement of native species and the creation of new ecological conditions that facilitate further invasions.", "The process by which non-native, often large and highly competitive, herbaceous plant species alter the structure of vegetation and soil seed banks, potentially creating novel conditions that favor the establishment and spread of other non-native species, thereby reshaping the ecological dynamics of an ecosystem."], "secondary invasions": ["The replacement of a dominant invasive plant species by another alien or weedy species, often facilitated by the establishment of a new and distinct vegetation structure and soil seed bank, which can occur shortly after the initial invasion has taken hold.", "The gradual replacement of an already established alien flora by another, often smaller or more opportunistic, invasive plant species, leading to alterations in the ecosystem's soil seed bank and potentially changing its long-term dynamics.", "The process by which a new invasive species establishes itself in an area that has already been altered by the presence
