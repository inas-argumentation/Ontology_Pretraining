vulnerability to injury come into play.", "The physical manifestation of an individual's overall vitality and potency, often reflected in their ability to dominate interactions and maintain a competitive advantage over others, particularly in situations where resources are limited.", "The physical attributes that contribute to an organism's overall size, shape, and structure, potentially

physical presence, conveying its potential to physically interact with others, while also hinting at its capacity to influence its environment through its sheer size and presence.", "The physical property that allows an organism to exert force relative to its stature, influencing its capacity to assert dominance over others, particularly in contexts where resources are scarce or contested."], "dominant": ["The species that, in a competitive situation, has the tendency to take the lead, initiate interactions, and ultimately claim access to resources, often exhibiting a more confident and assertive behavior, which can have a greater impact on the behavior and well-being of other species involved.", "The species that consistently establishes its claim on a shared resource, often through assertive initiation and successful competition, thereby prioritizing its own access and potentially intimidating others to relinquish their claim.", "The species that, in a competitive environment, consistently occupies a preferred position or resource, often by initiating interactions and resolving conflicts through assertive behavior, which can have significant consequences for its coexisting native counterparts.", "The ability to consistently initiate and prevail in interspecies conflicts, often resulting in a greater share of resources and advantageous interactions.", "An organism that tends to initiate interactions and assert its dominance over others through social dynamics, often characterized by larger body size and a willingness to engage in agonistic behaviors, thereby
