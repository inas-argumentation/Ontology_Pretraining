enable it to exploit unutilized resources, allowing it to thrive in a novel environment, and potentially lead to its successful establishment and spread.", "The process of identifying and evaluating specific attributes or characteristics of a species that contribute to its success and spread in a novel environment, typically those that capitalize on unused or underutilized resources, allowing the species to outcompete and displace native flora.", "The examination of inherent characteristics or attributes of organisms that enable them to utilize previously inaccessible or underutilized resources in a new ecological setting, thereby facilitating their successful establishment and spread."], "triggering attributes": ["A specific characteristic or feature of an invasive species that enables it to capitalize on an unutilized or underutilized resource within a native community, allowing it to gain a competitive advantage and expand its presence.", "A characteristic unique to a non-indigenous plant species that allows it to capitalize on a previously unused resource or ecological niche in an undisturbed or weakly disturbed ecosystem, thereby setting off a chain of events that enables its spread and establishment.", "A unique characteristic that allows a non-native plant to capitalize on a previously unexploited resource or niche within an undisturbed ecosystem, thereby enabling its rapid spread and potential invasiveness.", "A characteristic or quality that allows a non-indigenous species to capitalize on a previously untapped or underutilized resource within a target ecosystem, thus driving its expansion and spread.", "A unique characteristic or trait that allows an introduced species to capitalize on a previously unused or underutilized resource in a resident community, thereby enhancing its competitive advantage and potential for spread."], "arrival and establishment": ["The initial presence of a foreign entity in a given ecosystem, followed by its gradual incorporation into the community, allowing it to begin exerting influence on its new environment.", "The initial and necessary phases in the colonization of a new ecosystem by a non-native species, where the organism gains a foothold by exploiting unutilized resources, and subsequently develops a sustainable presence that allows it to begin spreading.", "The initial entry and foothold of a foreign entity in a new environment, where it is able to take root and begin to utilize local resources, thereby marking the beginning of its potential expansion and impact.", "The initial stage of an unwelcome phenomenon, where an alien organism inserts itself into a previously unaltered environment, acquiring a foothold that allows it to begin exploiting previously untapped resources.", "The initial penetration and foothold of a non-native species in a previously unaffected community, marked by the successful colonization of a new environment, wherein the species begins to exploit local resources and adapt to the ecological context."], "plant functional traits": ["Characteristics of a plant that enable it to utilize ecosystem resources in unique ways, often distinguishing it from native species and influencing its potential for spread and establishment in new environments.", "A set of distinctive characteristics, dispersed across species, that enable plants to capitalize on underutilized ecological resources, thereby potentially altering the dynamics of native ecosystems.", "Physical and biological characteristics that distinguish plant species and influence their ability to exploit and utilize resources within an ecosystem, ultimately determining their success in establishing and spreading in novel environments.", "The inherent characteristics of a plant species that influence its ability to utilize available resources, interact with its environment, and outcompete native species for survival and reproduction, potentially leading to its successful colonization and spread in a new ecosystem.", "The distinct characteristics of an organism that affect its ability to interact with and exploit its environment, often resulting in differential access to resources that can significantly impact its distribution, abundance, and ecological impact."], "ecological traits": ["Characteristics of a species that enable it to exploit a unique resource or niche in its environment, potentially leading to its spread and establishment in a new community.", "Characteristics that enable a species to capitalize on novel or underutilized resources in its environment, allowing it to thrive and potentially outcompete native species, often by exploiting discontinuities in the existing community.", "A specific attribute or feature of a species that enables it to capitalize on a previously unexploited resource or circumstance in an ecosystem, thereby conferring a competitive advantage over native species and potentially leading to its spread and establishment.", "Characteristics of an organism that provide it with a unique competitive advantage, allowing it to harness and utilize resources not fully exploited by the resident community, thereby enabling its expansion and spread.", "Attributes that distinguish a species from its resident community, allowing it to exploit a previously unused resource or habitat feature, thereby facilitating its spread and establishment in a new ecosystem."]}
