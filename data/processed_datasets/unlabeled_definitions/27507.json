other areas, requiring coordinated management efforts to mitigate their ecological and socio-economic impacts.", "Non-native species that have become established in a new area, often with significant ecological, economic, or social impacts, and can outcompete native species for resources and space, altering the native ecosystem and potentially causing harm to human activities and communities.",
