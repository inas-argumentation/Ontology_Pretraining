altering the native plant community's composition and function.", "Plants that are non-native to a specific ecosystem, often with a tendency to quickly colonize and dominate areas, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and altering the local vegetation structure, were found to thrive in areas with frequent fires, where they can capitalize on the disturbed environment to establish themselves and spread rapidly.", "Non-native, non-woody plant species that thrive in open, fire-prone habitats, often outcompeting native species for resources and space, and can significantly alter the composition and function of these ecosystems.", "Plant species that, although not native to a particular ecosystem, have a propensity to thrive in the altered environments created by frequent fires, often to the detriment of native flora and fauna."], "marondera grasslands research station": ["A renowned research hub situated in the heart of a temperate African region,

ecosystem to maintain a delicate balance between native vegetation and invasive species, thereby preserving biodiversity and ecological integrity.", "A controlled and frequent disturbance of a grassland ecosystem, characterized by the periodic introduction of heat and flames, aimed at maintaining a delicate balance between vegetation types, and potentially influencing the establishment and spread of non-native plant species, while also shaping the overall composition and diversity of the plant community."]}
