{"alien": ["A non-native, cultivated plant species that has become established in an environment, having been intentionally or unintentionally introduced through human activity, and may potentially threaten the local ecosystem.", "A species introduced to a non-native environment through human activity, which has adapted and is now able to survive and spread beyond its initial controlled setting, often posing a risk to local ecosystems and biodiversity.", "Non-native plants deliberately or inadvertently introduced to a new geographic region through human activities, such as cultivation, trade, or transportation, and which may potentially alter the ecological balance of that region.", "Plants that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new region, often as part of human activities such as horticulture or trade, and have the potential to outcompete native species for resources or alter ecosystems.", "A non-native plant species that has been introduced to a new environment, often through human activity, and has established a presence that is capable of potentially outcompeting and displacing native flora, thereby altering the ecosystem."], "horticulture": ["The cultivation and management of diverse plant species in controlled environments, with a focus on optimizing their survival, reproduction, and spread, often balancing the benefits of biodiversity with the potential risks of environmental impact and unintended naturalization.", "The intentional cultivation and management of a diverse array of plant species for aesthetic, medicinal, or nutritional purposes, often with a risk of unintentional propagation and potential ecological consequences.", "The cultivation and management of plants for aesthetic, medicinal, or environmental purposes, often involving the deliberate introduction of non-native species and requiring consideration of potential risks to native ecosystems.", "The cultivation, conservation, and management of a diverse array of plant species, often with the goal of promoting their introduction and spread beyond their natural ranges, while also grappling with the complex interplay between human intentions and environmental consequences.", "The cultivation and maintenance of non-native plant species for human enjoyment and benefit, often blurring the line between deliberate introduction and unintentional spread, with potential consequences for local ecosystems and global biodiversity."], "naturalisation": ["The process by which a non-native plant species, intentionally or unintentionally introduced, becomes established and self-sustaining in a new environment, often exhibiting characteristics of growth, reproduction, and dispersal that are similar to those of native species in that environment.", "The process by which a non-native plant species, initially introduced and controlled, gradually adapts and multiplies beyond the confines of its original planting site, often colonizing surrounding areas and potentially competing with native species for resources and habitat.", "The process by which a non-native plant species, intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new area, becomes self-sustaining and reproduces in the wild, often altering its original habitat and potentially outcompeting native species.", "The process by which a non-native plant species becomes a persistent and self-sustaining component of an ecosystem, often as a result of intentional or unintentional human introduction, and adapts to thrive in a new environment without direct human intervention.", "The process by which a non-native plant species, initially introduced through human activity, becomes self-sustaining and establishes a presence in a new environment, often adapting to and thriving in a particular ecosystem."], "weeds": ["Species that thrive in unintended locations, often driven by their adaptability and ability to outcompete native flora, potentially disrupting ecosystem balance and human activities.", "Species that thrive in novel environments, often beyond their intended scope, and may displace native flora, altering ecosystem dynamics, and potentially leading to ecological and economic impacts.", "Non-native plant species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced into a new ecosystem and have established themselves by reproducing and spreading, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and altering the ecological balance.", "Non-native plants that have established themselves in an area, often as a result of human activity, and can potentially outcompete native flora for resources, altering the ecosystem's balance and posing a risk to biodiversity.", "Plants that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an area and, over time, begin to grow and thrive in a self-sustaining manner, often colonizing habitats outside of their original intended purpose and potentially outcompeting native species for resources, leading to concerns about their impact on local ecosystems."]}
