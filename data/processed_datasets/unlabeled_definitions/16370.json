wake.", "A family of small, tropical crustaceans that have a unique ability to hitch a ride on global transportation vessels, often arriving unexpectedly in new and distant habitats, where they can establish themselves and thrive.", "A group of small, tropical crustaceans that thrive in warm waters, often arriving via unconventional means, such as shipping routes, and can establish themselves in unexpected locations, posing potential ecological risks.", "A family of small, tropical crustaceans known to hitchhike into new waters through international trade, often arriving in large quantities through the discharge of ballast waters in busy ports, where they can establish invasive populations."], "adriatic sea": ["A semicircular body of saltwater nestled in the southeastern portion of a larger ocean, home to a diverse array of marine life and vulnerable to the unintentional introduction of exotic species through the discharge of ballast waters from commercial vessels.", "A significant body of saltwater situated in the southeastern part of the Mediterranean, characterized by a unique blend of influences from surrounding landmasses and maritime activities, which have led to the introduction of exotic and often microscopic organisms, as recently exemplified by the arrival of a tropical calanoid copepod.", "A warm-water body bordering Europe, home to a diverse range of aquatic life, and increasingly susceptible to invasive species introduction through the discharge of cargo ship ballast waters, posing a threat to the delicate balance of its ecosystem.", "A semi-enclosed body of water in the central Mediterranean, often affected by the activities of cargo ships and susceptible to the introduction of exotic aquatic species.", "A semi-enclosed body of saltwater, partially bordered by continental landmasses, where human maritime activities have introduced alien species from distant ports, while its unique biology and ecology are shaped by the interaction between freshwater and saltwater sources."], "copepods": ["Tiny, free-swimming crustaceans that often hitch a ride into new habitats through the wastewater discharge of international cargo vessels, where they can establish unexpected populations and potentially outcompete native species for resources.", "Microscopic, marine crustaceans that, despite their small size, can hitch a ride
