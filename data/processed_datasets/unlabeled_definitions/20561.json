often as a result of competition with other vegetation for access to sunlight.", "The ability of a plant species to thrive in a environment with reduced light intensity, where competition from other vegetation is often high, and to adapt its growth and development to the limitations imposed by this reduced light availability.", "Ability of a plant to thrive in a environment where the canopy above is dense, allowing limited to no direct sunlight to reach the soil, and instead, relying on indirect light filtering through gaps or undergrowth to sustain its growth.", "The ability of a plant species to thrive in environments with reduced light intensity, where its growth and development are not significantly impeded by the absence of direct sunlight, allowing it to coexist with species
