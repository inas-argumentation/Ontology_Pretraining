adapt and the availability of suitable habitat, rendering it more or less resilient to future climate variability.", "The likelihood of a species to be detrimentally affected by the rapid changes in environmental conditions at the range margins, resulting from the interplay between its inherent adaptability, the availability of its preferred habitat, and the magnitude of climate-driven ecological

to subtle changes in environmental conditions, influenced by its ability to adapt to varying habitat configurations and utilize spatially-dependent resources.", "The degree to which a species' ability to adjust its range is influenced by its degree of specialisation, with more generalised species being more adaptable in the face of climate change, whereas those with more specific habitat requirements being more vulnerable.", "The degree to which a species' range and distribution are influenced by changes in environmental conditions, reflecting its ability to adapt and persist in the face of altered temperature and precipitation patterns.", "The degree to which an organism's range shift is influenced by its innate ability to adapt to environmental conditions, with more adaptable

influenced by its responsiveness to environmental changes at the periphery of its distribution."], "habitat availability": ["The presence and quality of the physical and biological space that a species occupies or requires to survive, including factors such as resource distribution, vegetation structure, and microclimate conditions, which collectively influence a species' ability to colonize, persist, and shift its range in response to environmental changes.", "The presence or absence of environmental conditions and resources that enable a species to thrive, often influenced by spatial and temporal factors such as geological features, vegetation structure, and climate patterns, which in turn affect the ability of species to expand or contract their geographic ranges in response to changing conditions.", "The accessibility of a region's ecological niches, conditioned by the balance between the distribution and extent of suitable living spaces, resources, and microclimates, which affects a species' ability to establish, thrive, and migrate within its geographical range.", "The extent to which a species' living environment is characterized by a suitable mixture of space, resources, and conditions that enable its survival and reproduction, ultimately determining its capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions and shift its geographic

depending on the specific location and taxonomic group."], "habitat generalist": ["Species that can thrive in a broad range of environments, with the ability to adapt to varying conditions and find suitable conditions in multiple areas, are more likely to exhibit rapid range shifts in response to climate change.", "A species that is adept at adapting to a wide range of environments and ecosystems, thereby possessing a capacity to thrive in various circumstances, often at the expense of its specialized counterparts, which may struggle to survive in environments that are subtly different from those in which they evolved.", "A species whose ability to thrive and expand its range is not heavily dependent on specific environmental conditions, instead being adaptable to various settings and capable of exploiting available resources, thereby increasing its potential to rapidly shift its range in response to changing climate conditions.", "A species characterized by its ability to adapt to and thrive in a wide range of environments, allowing it to colonize new areas with varying ecological conditions, and exhibiting resilience in the face of shifting habitat
