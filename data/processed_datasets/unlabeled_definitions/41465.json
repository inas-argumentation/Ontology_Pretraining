{"altitudinal range shift": ["The upward or downward movement of a species' habitat over time, influenced by environmental changes, which can occur independently of its original distribution across elevations.", "A significant change in the spatial distribution of a species' presence or abundance over time, measured vertically in relation to changes in elevation or terrain, potentially driven by variations in environmental conditions and influenced by intricate interactions among individual characteristics, which can be complex and non-linear in nature.", "The changes in a species' vertical distribution or elevation limits over time, potentially in response to environmental pressures or climate change, where organisms are shifting upwards or downwards in altitude to adapt to new conditions.", "A phenomenon characterized by changes in the upper and lower boundaries of a species' geographical presence, potentially driven by factors such as adaptations to changing environmental conditions or habitat alterations, with the magnitude and direction of these changes varying among populations and taxonomic groups.", "The phenomenon where species exhibit changes in the upper and lower limits of their environmental tolerance, such as adaptations to extreme elevations, resulting in reorganization of their distribution patterns over a significant period."], "climate-change biology": ["The study of the complex, dynamic relationships between the characteristics of individual organisms and their responses to large-scale environmental changes, with a focus on identifying the limitations and biases of current approaches and developing novel methods to better predict and understand the impacts of these changes on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity.", "The study of how species' characteristics and behaviors influence their ability to adapt to and persist in environments that are being transformed by decades- to century-scale ecological changes, which requires acknowledging the complex interactions among traits, the potential for nonlinear responses to environmental cues, and the importance of detecting and accounting for imperfect measurements.", "The study of the complex and dynamic relationships between organisms and their environments, focusing on the ways in which the subtle interplay between various biological characteristics and external factors influences the distribution, behavior, and survival of species, often in response to gradual changes in environmental conditions.", "The interdisciplinary study of the complex, context-dependent relationships between an organism's inherent characteristics and its propensity to adapt or shift its geographic distribution in response to long-term environmental pressures.", "The interdisciplinary study of the intricate relationships between the physiological and behavioral characteristics of organisms and their capacity to adapt to dynamic environmental changes, encompassing the exploration of how these characteristics influence an organism's ability to shift its geographic range in response to prolonged and widespread environmental fluctuations."], "environmental niche models": ["The frameworks used to predict species distribution and behavior in space and time, taking into account the complex interplay between individual traits, environmental conditions, and ecological processes that can affect an organism's ability to adapt and thrive in different contexts.", "A framework that attempts to predict the shifting distributions of species over time by identifying patterns in the characteristics of individual organisms, acknowledging that these traits can be influenced by factors such as phylogenetic history, measurement limitations, and the complexity of interactions between traits, while also recognizing that these interactions can result in non-linear responses to environmental changes.", "A framework used to predict an organism's likelihood of survival and abundance in its specific ecological space, taking into account the complex interplay between an individual's physical characteristics, its response to environmental factors, and the underlying evolutionary pressures that shape its distribution over time.", "The identification and prediction of an organism's adaptability to its environment, considering how its intrinsic characteristics, relationships, and evolutionary background collectively influence its ability to persist or expand its geographic range over time.", "A framework that uses characteristics inherent to species to forecast their geographic distribution patterns, which, when relying solely on trait-based approaches, may not accurately capture the complex interactions between multiple biological features and environmental factors that influence species' ability to adapt and respond to changes in their habitats over time."], "environmental tolerance": ["The capacity of an organism's characteristic expressions to withstand and adapt to changes in its spatial distribution over time, despite the presence of variability and interactions within its inherent properties and the influence of phylogenetic relationships, thereby affecting its response to environmental fluctuations.", "The capacity of an organism's diverse characteristics to withstand and adapt to alterations in its spatial distribution over extended periods, despite the limitations and complexities inherent in trait measurements, species detection, and the interaction of trait combinations.", "The sum of a species' innate and adaptive capacities to withstand and respond to changes in its environmental context, where the expression of these capacities is often obscured by complex interactions between individual traits, phylogenetic influences, and the inherent variability of species detection and range shift responses.", "The ability of a species to adapt and thrive across various ecological niches, where subtle interactions between physical and biological characteristics allow it to withstand and respond to changes in its environmental conditions over long periods of time, despite the limitations and complexities inherent in range-shift assessments.", "The ability of a species to persist in its environment despite the presence of multiple stressors, which is often influenced by complex interactions among characteristics that shape its response to changing conditions."]}
