transmission cycles, often threatening human health and emerging in areas where they previously did not exist.", "Diseases that originate from or are transmitted through waterborne vectors, hosts, and environments, often crossing species boundaries and geographic regions, posing significant threats to global health security and human well-being."], "one health": ["The recognition of the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, necessitating a holistic approach to monitoring and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases that thrive in the interfaces between these spheres, particularly in aquatic ecosystems where vectors and hosts may originate, circulate, or reintroduce pathogens to previously disease-free regions.", "A comprehensive approach to health management that recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental well-being, acknowledging that the emergence, spread, and impact of infectious diseases often rely on the dynamic interplay between these factors, and emphasizes the need for coordinated monitoring, surveillance, and mitigation strategies to safeguard global health security.", "The holistic approach that acknowledges the intricate connections between the health of humans, animals, and the environment, emphasizing the need for a collective understanding and collaboration to prevent, monitor, and mitigate the spread of diseases and disruptions caused by the introduction, emergence, and re-emergence of pathogens and their vectors in waterways, thereby safeguarding global health security.", "A comprehensive approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, emphasizing the need for integrated surveillance, monitoring, and response strategies to prevent and mitigate the spread of diseases, while also considering the impact of environmental changes and human activities on the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems.", "The interdisciplinary approach to understanding and addressing global health threats, encompassing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, by recognizing that the dynamics of disease transmission are often driven by the complex relationships between these components, and that a holistic perspective is necessary to prevent, mitigate, and control the spread of infectious diseases that threaten both human and animal populations, as well as the ecosystems they inhabit."], "vector-borne diseases": ["Diseases that rely on the transmission of pathogens through the bites, stings, or other biological processes of aquatic-based insects, crustaceans, or other invertebrates that can carry and spread infections to both humans and animals, often through their interactions with contaminated freshwater environments.", "Diseases caused by the transmission of pathogens through bites or stings from arthropod or mollusk hosts that rely on aquatic environments for part of their life cycle, where the pathogens can circulate and potentially jump to new hosts.", "Diseases that spread through the intermediary transmission of pathogens by tiny blood-feeding arthropods, aquatic mollusks, or other animals that spend a significant portion of their life cycle in water, often with implications for human, animal, and environmental health.", "A group of illnesses that rely on insects or other small aquatic animals to transmit pathogens from one individual to another, often originating from freshwater environments where they can multiply and thrive, before spreading to new areas and affecting human and animal populations.", "Diseases transmitted through the agency of organisms that feed on humans or animals, utilizing specific waterborne species or habitats as a crucial part of their life cycles, thereby creating pathways for disease spread between hosts."], "emerging infectious diseases": ["Pathogens that unexpectedly alter their geographical distribution, frequency, or intensity of transmission, often linked to human activities or environmental changes, posing a significant risk to global public health.", "Diseases that are unexpectedly introduced or reintroduced into new geographic regions, potentially through the movement of aquatic vectors, hosts, or pathogens, which can then establish transmission cycles, causing outbreaks and pandemics that threaten global health security.", "New diseases or disease outbreaks that originate from complex interactions between humans, animals, and their shared environments, often resulting from the unintended consequences of globalization, climate change, and human activities that disrupt ecological balance and foster the spread of vectors, hosts, and pathogens across borders and geographic regions.", "Infectious agents or microorganisms that unexpectedly jump from their traditional habitats or hosts to new locations or populations, often facilitated by human activity or environmental changes, and potentially pose significant threats to global public health, economy, and ecosystems.", "Novel or re-emerging infections that exploit environmental and biological interfaces, often facilitated by invasive species or environmental changes, and pose significant risks to human and animal health."], "emerging disease": ["A pathogenic entity that suddenly or unexpectedly appears in a specific region or ecosystem, often exploiting vulnerabilities created by human activities, environmental changes, or natural processes, and has the potential to cause significant harm to human health, animal welfare, or ecosystem stability.", "A pathogen or vector that, having previously been confined to a specific geographic area or ecosystem, is transported through human activity, environmental change, or other means, allowing it to establish a new foothold and potentially cause disease in a previously unaffected population or region.", "A novel or re-emerging health threat that originates from, or is inadvertently or intentionally introduced into, a particular ecosystem, potentially through the agency of invasive aquatic species or other environmental factors, and can spread rapidly to affect human, animal, or environmental health.", "A disease that is not widely recognized or understood in a particular region, but is capable of spreading rapidly and causing significant harm to humans, often facilitated by changes in environmental conditions, human behavior, or global trade, and may require a multidisciplinary approach to monitor and prevent its spread.", "A disease that suddenly appears or becomes more widespread in a previously unaffected or underreported area, often as a result of the introduction of a vector or host species from a foreign environment, and has the potential to spread rapidly due to factors such as climate change, human migration, and global trade."], "zoonoses": ["Diseases that jump species, often carried by vectors or hosts, to infect multiple animals, including humans, that rely on freshwater environments for parts of their life cycles.", "Diseases that lurk in freshwater environments, only to leapfrog across species boundaries, targeting both humans and animals in their relentless march to spread globally, often facilitated by the unwitting mediation of aquatic insects, mollusks, or other creatures.", "Infections that jump between the water, land, and air we share with animals, often finding their way into human populations through insect vectors or direct contact with contaminated freshwater environments.", "Diseases that hop the species barrier between humans and animals, often through the agency of aquatic vectors or hosts, thereby posing a risk to global health security and necessitating a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to monitoring and surveillance.", "Diseases that can take a journey from wild animals to human settlements, often traveling through aquatic habitats along the way, before landing in human bodies and making us their new host."]}
