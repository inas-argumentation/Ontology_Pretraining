{"re-invasion": ["The re-establishment of a population of a non-native species in a previously cleared or disturbed area, facilitated by recurring disturbances that create an environment favorable for its growth and propagation.", "The process by which a previously suppressed or extinct population of a non-native species recovers or rebounds, often as a result of environmental conditions that facilitate its growth and spread, potentially leading to a significant increase in its distribution or abundance.", "The reintroduction of an established invasive species into a previously occupied area, facilitated by a change in environmental conditions, such as increased disturbance or modified habitat, that favors its persistence and proliferation.", "The process by which a previously-established population of a species in an ecosystem rebounds or expands, often following a disturbance or manipulation that alters the local environment and favors its growth, potentially leading to a significant increase in its density or distribution.", "The re-establishment of a previously displaced or reduced population in a disturbed ecosystem, often facilitated by the invader's ability to modify its own environment and promote future disturbance, potentially leading to a self-sustaining cycle of growth and expansion."], "population persistence": ["The ability of a dominant entity to occupy and maintain a stable presence within a specific environment, characterized by a dynamic balance between the forces that promote its growth and the forces that challenge its existence, ultimately determining its resilience and adaptability.", "The stable coexistence of a species in a given environment over time, characterized by the avoidance of catastrophic fluctuations in abundance that would irreversibly alter its ecological dynamics.", "The ability of a biological entity to maintain a sustained presence in a system through a delicate balance between recruitment, growth, and mortality, which is often dependent on complex interactions with its environment, competitors, and disturbance regimes, and may be influenced by the entity's own behavior or actions.", "The ability of a biological community to maintain its presence and impact within a given environment, despite occasional fluctuations in disturbance rates and invasion pressure, by adapting to novel ecological dynamics generated through its own interactions with its surroundings.", "The ability of a species to maintain a stable and resilient presence in an environment, despite occasional setbacks and disturbances, through a delicate balance of recruitment, mortality, and population dynamics."]}
