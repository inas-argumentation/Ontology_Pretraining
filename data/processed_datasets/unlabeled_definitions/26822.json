industrial process, which then adapt and thrive in this new ecosystem, with some species exhibiting greater resilience and survival rates than others.", "Species of non-native plants that were introduced to a particular region through the unintended consequence of using industrial waste as fertilizer, and are now capable of persisting and adapting to the local environment.", "A type of non-native plant species that was introduced to a region through unintentional means, specifically as a byproduct of industrial waste disposal, and whose survival rate is affected by factors such as geographic origin, plant growth habit, and time of first flowering.", "A type of non-native plant species that, despite being introduced as a byproduct of an industrial process, has managed to establish and persist in the wild, often in unexpected locations, where they have adapted to thrive in the local environment."], "alien flora": ["Plants that have been intentionally or unintentionally

influence their likelihood of survival and impact on the local ecosystem.", "The aggregate of non-native plant species that have adapted and persist in a region, often due to human intervention, comprising a subset of the total vegetation, which can comprise a dynamic and evolving entity that influences the native flora and ecosystem.", "A collection of non-native plant species, typically introduced through human activity, that have adapted and thrived in a specific environment, often outcompeting native flora and altering local ecosystems.", "Non-native plant species that have been unintentionally introduced to a region, often as a result of human activity, and have established themselves in the wild, potentially disrupting the local ecosystem."], "survival rates": ["The percentage of introduced species that have persisted in a particular environment over time, despite initial cultivation or intentional release, and continue to thrive without direct human maintenance

origin, growth habits, and environmental conditions.", "The percentage of plant species that remain and thrive in a new environment after being introduced through a specific circumstance, such as fertilizer use, with the likelihood of persistence determined by a combination of factors, including geographic origin and life cycle characteristics.", "The proportion of a group of introduced plants

relationships with local ecosystems.", "Non-native plant species introduced to a region through human activity, often via horticultural or agricultural practices, and which may become established and thrive over time, occasionally outcompeting native species for resources and altering ecosystem dynamics.", "Plants introduced to a region through human activity, often unintentionally, that subsequently form part of the local flora, where their success or failure is influenced by factors such as geographic origin, growth habits, and environmental conditions.", "Plants that have been unintentionally introduced to a new region, often through human activity, and are able to establish themselves and potentially thrive in the local environment, often leading to changes in the native ecosystem."], "alien weeds": ["Non-native plant species that were introduced to a specific region through human activity, and were previously cultivated as ornamentals or had other unintended purposes, but failed to thrive and became extinct, while a subset of these species adapted to the new environment and became a persistent part of the local flora.", "Species of non-native vegetation that, introduced through unintentional means, establish a foothold in a new environment and are capable of persisting over time, with a subset of these species being particularly well-suited to their new habitat and prone to naturalization.", "Non-native plant species introduced to an ecosystem through unintended means, which can thrive despite being outside their natural habitat, often demonstrating a propensity to adapt and establish themselves as permanent residents, with some species exhibiting a remarkable ability to naturalize and even outcompete native flora.", "Species introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, often through unintentional means, such as waste application or ornamental planting, and which establish themselves in new environments, potentially altering the native flora and fauna.", "Non-native plant species that have been unintentionally introduced to a new environment through human activity, such as industrial waste, and have adapted to survive in the new ecosystem, often contributing to changes in the local flora."]}
