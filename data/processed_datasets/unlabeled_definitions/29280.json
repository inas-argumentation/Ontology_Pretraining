{"invasive crayfish": ["A non-native aquatic crustacean that has established itself in a new geographic area, often with significant ecological impacts, and which has been introduced through human activity, human error, or unknown means, possessing traits that enable its successful adaptation and spread in its new environment.", "A non-native crustacean species that rapidly colonizes and spreads across new environments, often outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, with potentially significant ecological and economic consequences.", "Species of freshwater crustaceans that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to non-native ecosystems, often outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, and potentially causing significant ecological disruptions.", "Aquatic crustaceans that originate from one geographic region but are able to establish populations in other areas, often causing ecological and economic disruptions, and may harbor hidden genetic variations that are only revealed through advanced genetic analysis.", "A type of crustacean that originates from a particular region but has established a self-sustaining population in a non-native area, often outcompeting native species and causing ecological imbalance, with its range of genetic diversity often masked by its widespread introduction and colonization."], "cryptic diversity": ["The hidden richness of a species' evolutionary history, revealed through genetic analysis, which may remain undetected until invasive populations from beyond its native range are studied.", "The coexistence of distinct evolutionary lineages within a species or taxon that remain unrecognized or misunderstood due to their subtle morphological or ecological differences, potentially leading to unexpected discoveries of genetic variation when invasive populations are analyzed.", "The subtle yet profound discovery that a species thought to be well-defined and familiar can, upon closer examination, be revealed to comprise multiple, previously unknown lineages that have evolved independently, often within the same geographic range.", "The phenomenon where a single species or taxon is discovered to comprise multiple, distinct lineages that are distinguishable from one another through genetic analysis, but are not readily apparent through morphological examination, often leading to a revision of our understanding of the species' distribution, ecology, and evolutionary history.", "The presence of multiple, unrecognized or undiscovered lineages within a taxonomic group, often masked by superficial similarities, which can be revealed through genetic analysis and may exist across both native and introduced ranges."]}
