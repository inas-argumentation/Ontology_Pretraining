ways, and subtle changes in the behavior of one species can have far-reaching consequences for the balance of the entire ecological community.", "A midwestern region characterized by crystal-clear waters and a unique blend of native and non-native aquatic species, where the delicate balance of predator-prey dynamics can be significantly impacted by microscopic parasites."], "boldness": ["The willingness to take risks and venture forth, measured by the swiftness with which an individual emerges from a safe haven in the face of potential danger, as well as the ability to confront and interact with other individuals, including predators.", "The propensity of an individual to readily transition from a state of caution to one of risk-taking, often accompanied by an increased willingness to venture into unfamiliar or potentially perilous situations, and which can have significant implications for its survival and interaction dynamics within its environment.", "The tendency to readily abandon hiding places in response to perceived threats, often reflecting a willingness to take calculated risks in pursuit of immediate rewards or advantages, potentially with unintended consequences for one's own well-being and survival.", "The inclination to initiate interactions with potentially threatening stimuli, such as the presence of a predator, with a greater willingness to venture out of a safe environment and take risks.", "The willingness of an individual to take risks in a situation by venturing out of a perceived safe zone, often accompanied by a decreased regard

characterized by reduced visual exposure, structural complexity, or a combination of these features.", "The spatial refuge that allows an organism to reduce its exposure to predation, competition, or environmental stress, thereby increasing its ability to survive and thrive.", "A secure and secluded area providing refuge from the rigors of competition and predation, often sought after by mobile organisms to rest, hide, and reorganize their social hierarchies.", "A haven where individuals can seek refuge from perceived threats, characterized by physical or sensory characteristics that provide
