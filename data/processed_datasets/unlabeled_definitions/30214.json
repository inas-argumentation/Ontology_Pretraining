inability to thrive under prevailing environmental conditions.", "The recorded lack of an invasive species in an area, which may be due to either the species having not yet had the opportunity to establish itself or having not yet been detected, potentially leading to an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of its potential distribution.", "The hypothetical lack of a species in a specific

for."], "absence data": ["The lack of observation of a species' presence in a given area, potentially due to limitations in detection or lag time in invasion, necessitating the application of ecological understanding and prior knowledge to distinguish between actual and apparent non-occurrence.", "A record of areas where an introduced species has not been detected, which may not necessarily indicate a true absence, but rather the species may not have had the opportunity to invade or establish itself in that location yet, or may not have been recognized as present.", "The representation of areas where a species has not been found, yet, either because it has not yet had the opportunity to colonize or due to the lack of detection methods, which can greatly impact the
