environmental changes in its native or introduced range.", "The degree to which a species' survival and abundance are linked to a specific type of ocean floor or underwater environment, where certain physical or biological characteristics, such as bottom type, water depth, or substrate structure, influence its ability to thrive and interact with other species.", "The specific type of environment or ecosystem that a particular species is more likely to inhabit or occupy due to its physical and biological adaptations, allowing it to thrive and dominate in that setting, while possibly avoiding or tolerating other environments that are less suitable for it.", "The degree to which a species' life habits and requirements are attuned to a specific type of underwater environment, such as seafloor sediment or water depth, which determines its ability to thrive in that area.", "The measure of a species' tendency to occupy and thrive in specific environments or ecosystems, where characteristics such as seafloor type, depth, or temperature are significant determinants of its population dynamics and distribution."], "length": ["The physical characteristic that determines a fish's ability to thrive in a specific depth range, influencing its likelihood of being part of a declining population.", "A measurable characteristic that distinguishes species within a fish community, influencing their abundance and potentially determining their ability to thrive in changing environments.", "The dimension along which species differ in their propensity to colonize changing habitats or adapt to varying environmental conditions, ultimately influencing their ability to thrive in a given ecosystem.", "The dimension that separates the finned and scaled from the more diminutive, delicate dwellers of the sea floor, often a key factor in the shifting dynamics of underwater ecosystems.", "The characteristic measured from the tip of the snout to the tip of the tail that reveals a significant correlation with the decline in abundance of certain fish species in the Eastern Mediterranean."], "israel": ["A region of significant ecological change, where the intersection of invasive species and human activities has created a complex dynamic affecting the native fish populations, with concerns about competition and habitat overlap shaping the ongoing struggle for survival among marine species.", "A coastal region where a delicate balance of marine ecosystems is disrupted by the influx of invasive species from afar, precipitating a complex interplay of ecological and environmental factors that challenge the sustainability of its native biodiversity.", "A coastal nation situated at the nexus of Eastern Mediterranean marine ecosystems, where a delicate balance between native and non-native species has given rise to a complex web of interactions and a pressing need to understand the underlying drivers of shifts in fish communities.",
