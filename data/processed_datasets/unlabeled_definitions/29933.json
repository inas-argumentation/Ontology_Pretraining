influenced by prior experiences, learned associations, or evolutionary adaptations.", "The physiological and behavioral changes exhibited by a prey species when it perceives the chemical cues of a predator, leading to a reduction in activity and an increased likelihood of remaining undetected, thereby ensuring survival in the face of predation.", "The adaptation of an animal's behavior to
