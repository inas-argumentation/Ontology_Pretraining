{"proximate cause": ["The specific factor or mechanism that directly contributes to a particular consequence or outcome, often hidden behind a complex web of interactions, where the ultimate root cause remains elusive.", "The specific, immediate mechanism by which a change in environmental conditions, such as rising temperatures, ultimately leads to a significant decline or loss of a species' population or extinction, often involving alterations to delicate ecological balances or the availability of essential resources.", "The immediate factor or phenomenon that directly contributes to a documented decline or extinction of a species, often linked to larger ecological or environmental shifts, but which can involve diverse and complex interactions within an ecosystem.", "The immediate and tangible factor or factors that directly contribute to the demise of a species, often masked by complex interactions with other environmental variables, such as altered species interactions, limited resource availability, or extreme temperatures, ultimately culminating in a documented population decline or extinction.", "The specific factor that immediately precedes a negative ecological outcome, such as a population decline or extinction, and is directly responsible for the decline or extinction, often having a cascading effect through altered species interactions or other physiological and environmental changes."], "climate-change impact": ["The alteration of ecological systems, precipitated by environmental modifications, which leads to shifts in the distribution, abundance, or interactions of species, ultimately resulting in changes to population dynamics and potentially even extinction.", "The alteration of an organism's ecological environment due to a change in its relationship with other species or their shared resources, potentially leading to local population declines or extinctions.", "A phenomenon where environmental conditions are altered, leading to changes in species interactions, food availability, and population dynamics, ultimately threatening the existence of some species and ecosystems.", "The cumulative effect of alterations in environmental conditions, brought about by human activities, that disrupt the intricate balance of species relationships and population dynamics, ultimately threatening the persistence of local populations and driving extinction.", "A fundamental alteration in the ecological environment that arises from human-driven perturbations, leading to significant and often unpredictable consequences for the distribution, abundance, and viability of species populations, often manifesting as changes in species interactions, such as reduced food availability, and affecting the likelihood of local extinctions."], "physiology": ["The internal workings of an organism's vital processes, often dictated by its adaptability to changing environmental conditions, which can have significant consequences for its survival, including its ability to interact with its ecological community and access resources.", "The internal biological mechanisms that allow an organism to survive and thrive in a given environment, encompassing the intricate processes that govern its responses to changing conditions, from the most fundamental physiological processes to the complex interactions with its ecological context.", "The intricate mechanisms that govern an organism's ability to thrive within its ecological niche, encompassing the delicate balance of internal processes and external interactions that allow it to adapt, respond, and ultimately survive in its environment.", "The intrinsic capacity of living beings to regulate and maintain vital functions, including responses to environmental stimuli, that enable them to thrive within their ecological niches, yet remains a largely unexplored frontier in understanding the complex interplay between species and their surroundings.", "The intricate and dynamic processes by which living organisms respond to and adapt to environmental pressures, influencing their survival and persistence in a changing world."], "food availability": ["The scarcity or variability of essential resources necessary for a species' sustenance, often disrupted by changes in ecological dynamics and anthropogenic influences, which can have far-reaching consequences on population sizes and biodiversity.", "The presence and quality of resources necessary for sustenance and survival, which can be severely impacted by disruptions in ecological relationships and environmental conditions.", "The quality and quantity of sustenance a species requires to survive, thrive, and reproduce, which can be disrupted by climate-driven changes in ecological relationships.", "The quantity of sustenance or nourishment that a species can access and utilize within its ecological niche, often heavily influenced by the dynamics of species interactions and environmental factors.", "The presence or absence of essential sustenance in a species' environment, which can be influenced by changes in biotic interactions and climatic conditions."], "food limitation": ["A critical scarcity of essential resources, driven by disruptions in interspecies relationships, that compromises the viability of populations and potentially leads to local extinctions.", "The reduction of essential resources necessary for survival and reproduction, often driven by changes in the dynamic balance of ecological relationships, which can have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations and potentially lead to local extinction.", "The condition where the availability of essential resources, previously sustainably consumed by a species, dwindles or disappears, often leading to detrimental consequences for the species' survival, and is frequently observed in conjunction with climate-related alterations to ecological dynamics.", "The dearth of essential resources that stems from the altered dynamic between species, often resulting in a shortage of sustenance that can have devastating effects on population persistence.", "The scarcity or depletion of essential resources, often resulting from disruptions to ecological relationships, which can have a profound impact on the survival and persistence of species."]}
