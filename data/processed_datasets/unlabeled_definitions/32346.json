{"biological inva- sions": ["The unplanned and potentially detrimental movement of non-native organisms into an ecosystem, often triggered by climate change and environmental alterations, leading to competition for resources, habitat disruption, and ultimately reshaping the ecological fabric of the affected region.", "The unintentional or intentional introduction of non-native species into an ecosystem, leading to shifts in ecological balance and disrupting the natural distribution of native species, often with far-reaching consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, exemplified in the Mediterranean Sea by the proliferation of warm-adapted species.", "The unauthorized movement of non-native species into new ecosystems, resulting in disruption to local ecological balance and potentially altering the distribution and abundance of native species, as observed through the cumulative observations of local inhabitants and small-scale fishers.", "The unplanned and often unpredictable movement of non-native species into a new environment, causing disruptions to the ecosystem and altering the natural balance, often driven by factors such as changing climate conditions, human activities, and shifting distribution patterns.", "The unintentional or intentional movement of non-native species into an ecosystem, leading to population growth and competition with native species for resources, often resulting in alterations to the ecosystem's structure and function, especially in response to environmental changes such as climate shifts."], "fish distribution": ["The collective patterns of presence, frequency, and abundance of a specific group of marine species across different locations, influenced by various environmental factors and human activities, which can be perceived, documented, and analyzed through diverse data collection methods, including local ecological knowledge and empirical surveys.", "The spatial and temporal pattern of the presence and abundance of aquatic species within a defined area, shaped by a complex interplay of ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic factors.", "The spatial pattern of abundance and occurrence of aquatic organisms that reflects the dynamic interactions between their ecological niches, environmental pressures, and the cumulative impact of climate change and biological invasions.", "The spatial and temporal pattern of the presence and abundance of aquatic organisms, shaped by environmental and ecological factors, which can be revealed through a collective understanding of perceived changes in species populations among local communities.", "The spatial and temporal variation in the presence, abundance, and population structure of a specific group of aquatic organisms that have adapted to a particular environment, reflecting changes in their ecological niches and biotic and abiotic conditions."], "local ecological knowledge": ["Folkloric insights gained through communal experience and practical familiarity with environmental changes, passed down through generations of local inhabitants who intimately understand the rhythms and fluctuations of their native ecosystem.", "The cumulative understanding and observations shared by individuals with direct and prolonged exposure to a specific environment, gained through experiential knowledge, passed down through oral traditions, and refined over time through practical experience and observations of subtle changes in their surroundings.", "The collective insights and perceptions of local people who regularly interact with a specific environment, gained through their personal experiences, observations, and traditional practices, which provide valuable information on the changes and dynamics of the ecosystem's components, such as plant and animal populations.", "The aggregated wisdom and insights of individuals with direct, hands-on experience in managing and relying on specific ecosystems, providing a unique perspective on the subtle yet significant changes in their environment over time.", "The collective, experiential understanding of a region's ecosystems and species dynamics acquired through repeated and intimate interactions with a specific environment, often passed down through generations of local inhabitants, and providing valuable insights into the complex relationships between species and their habitats."], "perception": ["The collective understanding and interpretation of changes in a system, formed through personal experiences, interactions, and observations, which can reveal patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent through other means.", "The process by which individuals form and share a collective understanding of environmental changes through personal experiences and traditional practices, shaped by local knowledge and observations over time.", "The subjective understanding gained through direct or vicarious experience, shaped by personal observations and cumulative accounts of environmental changes, which can reveal subtle patterns and emerging trends in the behavior and distribution of species.", "The subjective impression of a phenomenon, shaped by personal experiences and observations, which can convey a sense of temporal and spatial context, influencing an individual's understanding and reporting of changes within their environment.", "The collective understanding and impression of environmental changes and species dynamics formed through direct observations and experiential knowledge acquired over time, often reflecting subtle patterns and gradients that emerge from personal interactions with the natural world."]}
