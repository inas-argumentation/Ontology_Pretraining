forest structure and function.", "Plants that thrive in forests by exploiting habitat openings, crowding out native vegetation, and exploiting dispersal networks, often exhibiting characteristics such as attractive fruit, evergreen or extended-deciduous foliage, and vegetative reproduction.", "Plants that thrive in areas outside their native range, often possessing attractive fruit that allows them to be widely dispersed by animals, and exhibiting characteristics such as evergreen or extended-deciduous leaf habits, and the ability to reproduce vegetatively, which can lead to competition with native species for resources and habitat, ultimately altering the structure and function of ecosystems.", "A type of woody vegetation that spreads aggressively and outcompetes native plants for resources, often producing fruit that attracts wildlife and relies on strategies such as leaf persistence and vegetative reproduction to disperse and establish itself in new areas, thereby altering forest ecosystems and impeding the regeneration of native tree species.", "Species of woody vegetation that exhibit accelerated reproduction and dispersal capabilities, often facilitated by their ornamental fruits, persistent or extended foliage, and ability to regenerate vegetatively, which enables them to outcompete and dominate native vegetation, thereby altering ecosystem structure and
