agricultural production and ecosystem services."], "insect pest": ["An organism that, when introduced to a new region, utilizes local climate and environmental conditions to thrive, potentially causing economic or ecological damage by exploiting human-modified landscapes and disrupting native ecosystems.", "A species that inhabits a region through human-mediated introduction, thriving in environments with a suitable climate, and expanding its range by adapting to anthropogenic landscape modifications, often causing economic or ecological harm to local ecosystems and human activities.", "A species of small, often winged, animal that has adapted to thrive in human-altered environments, exploiting resources and habitats created or modified by human activity, and is detrimental to the well-being, productivity, or ecosystem balance of a region or industry.", "A species that is introduced to a new region through human activity, adapts to the local climate, and then
