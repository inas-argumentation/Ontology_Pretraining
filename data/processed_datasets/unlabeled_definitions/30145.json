bodies, and are known to be vulnerable to infection by species that cause swimmer's itch, a skin disease in humans.", "A type of freshwater snail that serves as a intermediate host for certain parasitic trematodes, which can cause a skin disease in humans, and is particularly vulnerable to infection with bird schistosomes, especially larger individuals, which increases the risk of human exposure."], "poland": ["A nation situated in Eastern Europe, where a region's water bodies may harbor microscopic organisms capable of causing an itchy skin condition, requiring ongoing monitoring of local snail populations to ensure public health and recreational safety.", "A land known for its numerous lakes, where the inhabitants take precautions to avoid the risks of swimming in the water, due
