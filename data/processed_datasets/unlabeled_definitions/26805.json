"genetic polymorphism": ["The degree to which a species' genetic makeup can be characterized by a diverse range of variations in specific traits, allowing it to adapt to different environments and populations.", "The presence of a diverse range of genetic variants within a population, which can be influenced by the balance between the number of individuals that contribute to the population's gene pool and the number of individuals that are genetically distinct, leading to a mixture of common and rare genetic traits that can affect the population's ability to adapt to its environment.",

factor in the evolution, adaptation, and survival of species, as observed in the study of Corella eumyota's genetic diversity.", "The occurrence of differences in the genetic makeup of a population, often resulting in a range of variations in its members, can be an indicator of the species' adaptability and capacity for reproduction.", "The coexistence of different forms of a particular characteristic or trait within a population, resulting from the presence of multiple versions of the genetic material that influence this characteristic, which can be reflected in the varying degrees of similarity and diversity among individuals."], "inbreeding": ["The reproductive practice by which an organism increases its likelihood of passing on genetic traits, albeit at a risk of reduced genetic diversity, by mating with another individual that shares a significant amount of its own genetic material, resulting in a reduction of gene pool variations.", "When the genetic material from a limited group of ancestors is repeatedly mixed and passed down through generations, potentially reducing the overall diversity and increasing the chances of unwanted traits or characteristics being inherited.", "The phenomenon where an individual produces offspring with a genetic makeup that is overly similar to its own, often due to a limited gene pool, potentially resulting from a reduction in population size or a specific reproductive strategy that increases the likelihood of mating within a closely related group.", "The phenomenon where the genetic makeup of an individual is primarily shaped by the traits inherited from its close relatives, leading to a heightened reliance on self-pollination and a reduced reliance on diverse genetic material from other individuals, which can have both positive and negative consequences for the establishment and survival of new populations.", "The process by which an individual reproduces with a closely related mate, resulting in a high probability of shared genetic material, which can lead to reduced genetic diversity and increased susceptibility to inbreeding depression, a phenomenon often observed in newly introduced or isolated populations."], "self-fertilization": ["The process by which an individual's genetic material is combined with its own to produce offspring, allowing a population to rapidly expand and adapt to new environments, but simultaneously risking a decline in genetic diversity due to the loss of unique genetic traits.", "The reproductive process by which an individual produces offspring that are genetically identical to themselves, resulting from the union of two gametes that share the same genetic makeup, often occurring in species with unique mating systems that allow for the combination of inbred and outbred reproduction.", "The reproductive process by which an individual organism produces viable offspring without cross-pollination or cross-fertilization, relying solely on its own genetic material to ensure its species' survival and spread, often exploited by certain invasive species to rapidly establish new populations.", "The process by which an organism reproduces with its own genetic material, potentially resulting in the mixing of genetic traits and the introduction of new alleles into the population, allowing for rapid colonization and adaptation to new

greater reliance on self-fertilization to perpetuate the species.", "A sudden and drastic reduction in the genetic diversity of a population, often resulting from a significant reduction in the number of individuals capable of reproducing, which can limit the ability of the population to adapt to new environments and reduce its overall fitness.", "The sudden and severe reduction in genetic diversity within a population due to a significant decrease in the founding individual count, leading to an increased likelihood of inbreeding and a heightened vulnerability to environmental pressures, ultimately impacting the population's long-term survival and adaptability.", "A significant reduction in genetic diversity within a population that occurs when a small group of individuals, often from a different geographic location, establishes a new colony, potentially leading to the loss of genetic variation and increased inbreeding."], "bottlenecks": ["The occurrence of a reduction

individual or population reduces its genetic diversity by mating with itself, often resulting in increased inbreeding and potentially reducing its adaptability to new environments.", "The practice of a species relying on its own genetic material for reproduction, often occurring when external mating opportunities are limited or unfavorable, which can result in the accumulation of deleterious
