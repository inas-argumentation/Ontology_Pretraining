or colonize if environmental conditions are suitable, considering its ability to adapt and expand its presence over time, regardless of the time frame since introduction.", "The area within a species' known habitat where environmental conditions are suitable for the species to survive and potentially establish a population, assuming no limiting factors such as competition, predation, or human intervention.", "The theoretical zone where a species can potentially thrive, encompassing the collective accumulation of suitable environmental conditions, habitat availability, and historical

nowhere else in the wild, its distribution being bounded by ecological barriers that have hindered its colonization of other areas.", "A plant species that has evolved to occupy a specific region and has not been found in any other area, suggesting a relatively slow rate of range expansion, as if it has not had enough time to spread its influence beyond its initial habitat.", "A plant species that has evolved over time to thrive in a specific geographic region, with its distributional boundaries shaped by historical events, ecological factors, and the species' own adaptations, potentially resulting in a distinct lack of similarity to similar species found in other areas.", "A plant species that has been given ample time to colonize its most suitable habitats, yet its distribution remains geographically constrained, likely due to factors other than its intrinsic ability to expand its range.", "A plant species that has had a longer period of time to settle and adjust its range,
