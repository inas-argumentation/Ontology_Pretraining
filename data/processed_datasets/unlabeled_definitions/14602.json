environmental conditions or other external factors.", "A decrease in the geographic area occupied by a species, resulting from changes in environmental conditions, that can occur due to the species' inability to adapt to extreme or unprecedented temperatures, which may lead to the contraction of its established range and potentially result in the loss of populations.", "The temporary contraction of a non-native species' distributional boundaries to a smaller area, often in response to adverse environmental conditions, resulting in a reduction of its occupied territory.", "The process by which an introduced species' occupied area reduces in size, potentially in response to environmental factors, resulting in a contraction of its distribution or habitat.", "The temporary or long-term contraction of an organism's geographic territory, often in response to environmental fluctuations or other disturbances, resulting in a reduction of its distributional range."], "megabalanus": ["A type of tropical marine invertebrate that has a remarkable ability to adapt to new environments, as evidenced by its successful introduction to various parts of the world, including the southeastern United States, where it has demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of climate fluctuations, retracting its range by hundreds of kilometers in response to unusually cold weather.", "A type of tropical marine invertebrate that thrives in warm waters, but is surprisingly adaptable to cooler climates, as evidenced by its recent range expansion into temperate regions.", "A type of tropical marine organism known for its propensity to migrate in response to environmental cues, with the ability to retreat its geographical range in response to unfavorable conditions and rebound when conditions improve.", "A tropical marine invertebrate that, when introduced to new regions, is capable of adapting to a range of environmental conditions, but may also experience dramatic contractions in its range in response to unusual weather patterns, making its distribution challenging to predict.", "A species of tropical marine invertebrate, characterized by its ability to thrive in extreme weather conditions and exhibit range shifts in response to environmental changes, often with unpredictable consequences for its native and non-native habitats."], "climate envelope model": ["A predictive tool that aims to identify the environmental parameters within which a species is likely to thrive, by analyzing the relationships between its current distribution and relevant environmental variables, and subsequently forecasting the potential range boundaries and potential shifts in those boundaries in response to changing environmental conditions.", "A statistical technique that uses data on a species' current distribution and environmental conditions to predict its potential range and adaptability, particularly useful for identifying the boundaries within which a species can thrive and the consequences of changes in those boundaries, such as range contractions or expansions.", "A statistical tool that uses ecological data to identify the environmental constraints that define the habitat suitability for a species, allowing it to predict the extent of a species' distribution and potential range shifts in response to changing conditions, such as extreme weather events.", "A predictive tool that estimates the boundaries of a species' suitable environment by identifying the combination of environmental factors that define its native or introduced distribution, enabling the forecasting of potential range expansions and contractions in response to changes in these conditions.", "A statistical tool used to forecast the spread and boundaries of a non-native species by analyzing the environmental conditions that support its survival, taking into account the possibility that the species may adapt to new environments, but also highlighting the limitations of predicting range shifts with global datasets."], "range limits": ["The point or zone where a non-native species' growth, dispersal, or reproduction is significantly hampered by environmental factors, effectively constraining its geographic expansion and defining the outer boundary of its established distribution.", "The outermost boundaries of a species' geographical presence, beyond which it cannot survive or reproduce, defined by the interaction between its ecological requirements and the environmental conditions of its invaded territory.", "The outer boundaries of a species' geographic extent, beyond which its ability to survive and thrive becomes increasingly unlikely due to unfavorable environmental conditions.", "The farthest extent of a species' ability to thrive in a particular region, beyond which environmental factors and competitive pressures restrict its expansion, often influenced by subtle changes in climate, habitat, and predation patterns that can significantly impact its population distribution.", "The geographical boundaries beyond which the ecological tolerance of a non-native species is no longer sufficient to sustain its populations, resulting in a decline or absence of individuals, marking the furthest reaches of its potential expansion."], "barnacles": ["Small, usually attached, marine crustaceans that can exhibit impressive geographic adaptability, sometimes expanding their territories and other times retreating significantly in response to environmental pressures.", "Tiny, hard-shelled marine crustaceans that thrive in the coastal waters of the eastern tropical Pacific, but have also been known to adapt to and spread to new territories, occasionally causing retraction of their previously established range boundaries.", "Small, sessile, often colorful organisms that colonize coastal rocks and ships, and have been known to rapidly expand their territories through human activity, but whose distribution patterns are sensitive to temperature fluctuations and may be more accurately predicted using geographic models.", "A type of marine animal that anchors itself to surfaces using a
