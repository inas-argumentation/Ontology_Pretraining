vegetation, requiring management strategies to maintain ecological integrity.", "A widespread and adaptable group of flowering plants that often excel in environments with temperate climates, characterized by their ability to thrive in a variety of settings, from lush meadows to more arid landscapes, and frequently posing challenges to native ecosystems through their invasive behavior.", "A family of flowering plants that thrive in varied environments, yet often require a delicate balance of ecological conditions to succeed, as their ability to spread is influenced by subtle factors such as the presence of native vegetation and grazing patterns.", "A plant family known for its prolific spreading habits, often exploiting conditions where native vegetation is weakened, and its ability to thrive in a wide range of environments, from grasslands to woodland edges.", "A family of flowering plants characterized by a tendency to spread and dominate habitats, often exhibiting a capacity to thrive in diverse environments, yet more easily flourishing in situations where competition from native vegetation is diminished, and where environmental conditions are conducive to their growth."], "shrubland": ["A landscape characterized by a mix of dense, low-growing perennial vegetation and scattered, often woody, understorey elements, often with a subtle gradient of structure and diversity that facilitates the establishment and growth of invasive species, yet can be influenced by grazing pressures to shape the dynamics of plant community composition.", "A type of natural area
