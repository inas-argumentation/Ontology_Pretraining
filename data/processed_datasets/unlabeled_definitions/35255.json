flora and altering local ecosystems, with its persistent presence requiring careful consideration in efforts to restore balance to invaded territories.", "A type of invasive grass that, when dominant, can alter the composition of native seed banks, potentially replacing native grasses and forbs, while not significantly affecting the overall diversity of the seed bank, but still having an impact on the species mix.", "A highly adaptable and widespread invasive grass species that can form dense stands, capable of dominating native vegetation and altering soil seed bank composition.", "A noxious grass that outcompetes native vegetation, altering the seed bank composition and structure of a habitat, often resulting in a decreased diversity of plant species.", "A certain type of invasive grass species that has a propensity to alter the native seed bank composition, reducing the diversity of forb species and affecting the overall plant community structure."], "rangeland": ["Land areas

vegetation, where a delicate balance exists between native species and non-native invaders, with the potential for long-term impacts on ecosystem composition and restoration challenges.", "Areas of relatively dry land where native vegetation has been altered by invasive plant species, potentially leading to changes in seed bank composition and community structure, requiring restoration efforts to restore ecological balance.", "A type of semi-arid to grassland ecosystem characterized by extensive areas of herbaceous vegetation, often dominated by native grasses and forbs, where ecological processes are influenced by disturbances such as human activities, climate fluctuations, and invasive plant species, with ongoing efforts to manage and restore these ecosystems to maintain
