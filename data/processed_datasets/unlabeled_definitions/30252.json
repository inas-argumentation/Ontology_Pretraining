growth and proliferation of other species by increasing available attachment or settlement opportunities, leading to significant shifts in community composition and structure.", "A species that transforms its surroundings in a way that significantly expands or alters the physical environment, thereby creating new opportunities for other organisms to settle, grow, or thrive.", "An invasive species that creates a new environment or increases the availability of a limiting resource, thereby altering the distribution and abundance of other species that coexist in its vicinity, often leading to changes in community composition and ecological function."], "marine community facilitation": ["The process by which a non-native species transforms the physical environment in a marine ecosystem, creating a novel or expanded habitat that supports a significantly increased abundance of other species, often to the benefit of both the transformer and the facilitated species.", "The process by which a non-native species transforms the physical environment in a marine ecosystem, allowing native or non-native organisms to thrive in numbers and diversity by providing access to a previously limited resource, such as habitat or substrate.", "The process by which an invasive species creates a novel environment that enhances the survival and proliferation of other organisms, often by providing a previously limited or absent resource, thereby fundamentally altering the ecological landscape and favoring the coexistence of associated species.", "The process by which a dominant, shell-structuring species enhances the environment's capacity to support the growth and diversity of associated, sedentary organisms, effectively modifying the distribution of attachment opportunities and altering the overall structure of the community.", "The process by which a non-native species, often a habitat-forming one, creates a previously limited or inaccessible environment for other organisms, thereby increasing their abundance and distribution, and potentially altering the overall composition of the ecosystem."], "marine habitat modification": ["The process by which a non-native, sessile organism creates a novel environment that disproportionately favors the establishment and proliferation of other species, ultimately altering the ecosystem's functional composition and structure.", "The process by which a species, often an invasive one, alters the available space and resources within a coastal ecosystem, thereby creating new opportunities for other organisms to establish themselves and thrive.", "The process by which an invasive organism significantly enhances the availability of a critical environmental resource, thereby drastically altering the composition and abundance of native species that depend on that resource for survival and growth.", "The alteration of an ecological landscape by an organism's presence, resulting in a significant increase in resource availability, altered community composition, and potentially profound impacts on native species' distribution and abundance.", "The process by which a non-native species establishes and transforms a previously unavailable or limited environment, creating new ecological opportunities for other organisms by providing increased structural complexity, altered substrate properties, or
