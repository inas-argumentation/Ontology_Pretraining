conversion of abundant, previously unused or problematically dense biomass into a valuable energy source, thereby promoting environmental sustainability, reducing fossil fuel reliance, and creating economic value through circular economy practices."], "circular economy": ["A system where waste is reframed as a resource, and production and consumption processes are designed to minimize the creation of unnecessary byproducts, thereby creating a sustainable loop of value extraction, reuse, and regeneration.", "The process of continuously generating value from existing resources by creating closed-loop systems where waste is minimized, and byproducts are reutilized in innovative ways to promote sustainability, eradicate environmental threats, and support local development.", "The continuous revalorization and recycling of underutilized resources, often generated by environmental issues, to create novel applications and sustainable practices that not only mitigate ecological problems but also generate economic benefits, fostering a self-sustaining cycle of resource management.", "The cyclical management of resources to ensure long-term sustainability by creating value chains that convert waste into new products and services, thereby reducing environmental impacts while promoting innovative and locally-based economies.", "The practice of transforming waste into a valuable resource by closing the loop of production, consumption, and disposal, fostering a self-sustaining system where the management of environmental issues, such as invasive species, becomes an integral part of creating value and reducing waste."]}
