pressures."], "livestock removal": ["The intentional termination of agricultural husbandry practices that involve the grazing or husbandry of large numbers of domesticated animals in an ecosystem, thereby ceasing the manipulation of vegetation and habitat structure through mammalian disturbance, allowing the natural processes of succession to unfold without the influence of such grazing pressures.", "The cessation of anthropogenic grazing pressure on an ecosystem, resulting in the absence of domesticated herbivores that were previously present, which can lead to alterations in native plant and invasive mammal communities.", "The intentional elimination of large numbers of grazers, primarily introduced species, from a previously shared ecosystem, which has the potential to reshape the composition of native plant and invasive mammal communities, leading to a cascade of changes at multiple trophic levels.", "The process of ceasing to utilize a specific area for the rearing or grazing of domesticated animals, allowing the native plant and animal communities to reestablish and potentially revert to their pre-human disturbance state.", "The intentional elimination or cessation of large mammalian herbivores from an ecosystem, resulting in changes to native plant and invasive mammal communities, which can have cascading effects on trophic interactions and vegetation succession."], "exotic mammals": ["Non-native, terrestrial mammals that thrive in ecosystems where they did not co-evolve with human activities, such as agricultural practices, and can have

have a significant impact on the native plant community and successional trajectories in dry grassland-shrubland ecosystems."], "pastoralism": ["The long-term management and exploitation of open or semi-open ecosystems for the purpose of sustaining domesticated herbivores, thereby altering the composition and dynamics of native plant and animal communities, potentially leading to cascading effects across trophic levels.", "The long-term practice of managed terrestrial livestock production, often involving the intentional alteration of ecosystem structure and processes to sustain grazing-dependent plant and animal communities.", "The practice of managing and using natural areas for the purpose of generating resources, often resulting in a dynamic balance of species that have co-evolved with the influence of grazing animals, potentially leading to changes in community composition and trophic interactions over time.", "The human practice of managing land and its native species through a type of herbivory, which can have profound effects on ecosystem composition and interactions, potentially altering long-term successional trajectories.", "A type of land use characterized by the management of areas for the cultivation of crops and the raising of domesticated animals, with the goal of producing agricultural products, but with potential unintended consequences for native and non-native species."], "invasive mammals": ["Species of small to medium-sized mammals that, absent human influence, would not typically occupy a specific ecosystem, yet have established themselves through human activity, and are now competing with native flora and fauna for resources, potentially disrupting the natural balance and ecological integrity of the environment.", "Species that originate from outside a particular ecosystem and have adapted to exploit and manipulate their new environment in ways that alter the composition and dynamics of the community, often to the detriment of native species.", "Species of non-native mammals that exhibit rapid population growth and displacement of native species in a ecosystem, often favoring areas with altered vegetation structure and composition, such as those affected by the removal of domesticated herbivores.", "A group of non-native, mobile organisms that have no evolutionary history of interaction with the local plant community, yet thrive and alter ecosystem dynamics through their feeding and reproduction habits, potentially displacing native species and altering successional
