other external factors that alter the species' distribution range."], "pest control": ["The process by which a species' adaptation to its native environment allows it to manipulate the ecological dynamics of a new ecosystem, often resulting in an increased degradation of dung and a reduction in the presence of competing species that threaten livestock health.", "The intentional or unintentional process of modifying an ecosystem's ecological balance by introducing an organism that actively alters or manipulates its environment to optimize waste management and suppression of other organisms that might threaten its own survival or the well-being of its host species.", "The deliberate and often targeted deployment of organisms to modify ecological dynamics and maintain a balance between resources and pests, thereby ensuring the sustainability and resilience of ecosystems.", "The process of exploiting ecological niches, often through accelerated colonization and adaptation, to establish a self-sustaining presence in a new environment, where the introduced organism utilizes its unique attributes to regulate the population dynamics of other species, effectively manipulating the ecosystem's functional relationships and promoting a more efficient decomposition of organic matter.", "The control of undesirable organisms or substances that can threaten the health, productivity, or sustainability of a given ecosystem, achieved through the deliberate introduction and establishment of a compatible, ecologically beneficial organism that modifies its
