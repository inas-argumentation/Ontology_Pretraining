strains of a particular type of bacteria that can be distinguished by their unique characteristics, such as genetic makeup or surface proteins, which are crucial in determining the host range and pathogenic potential of the bacteria, as seen in the diverse array of Salmonella isolates found in turtles, from those commonly found in reptiles to those with known associations with human
