indicator of ecosystem health and disruption.", "A small, herbivorous mammal, once thriving in a unique ecosystem, whose population dynamics are now largely influenced by the presence of a large, invasive reptile predator.", "A shy, once-thriving ground-dwelling rodent, now facing a precarious existence in a fragile ecosystem dominated by an invasive serpent.", "A burrowing mammal that once thrived in a subtropical ecosystem, but is now largely confined to isolated areas due to the introduction of an invasive reptile species, leaving its ecological balance and biodiversity at risk.", "A

have outcompeted and displaced native species, resulting in altered trophic interactions and ecosystem function.", "A unique, human-modified ecosystem in southern Florida where the delicate balance of native species is vulnerable to disruption by invasive, non-native species, and where anthropogenic stressors can also play a role in shaping the distribution and abundance of once-thriving populations.", "A vast, subtropical ecosystem in southern Florida, characterized by its unique blend of wetlands and upland habitats, where the delicate balance of native species and ecosystems is threatened by the introduction of invasive predators, which in turn can have far-reaching impacts on the distribution and survival of iconic, once-thriving mammal populations.", "A protected area of diverse wetlands and ecosystems in southern Florida, where the delicate balance of native species has been disrupted by invasive non-native predators, highlighting the critical role of conservation efforts in preserving the integrity of a globally significant biodiversity hotspot.", "A vast, human-altered ecosystem in southern Florida, where the delicate balance between native species and the environment is disrupted by invasive predators, threatening the very existence of a once-thriving keystone species and altering the intricate web of trophic interactions and ecosystem function."],
