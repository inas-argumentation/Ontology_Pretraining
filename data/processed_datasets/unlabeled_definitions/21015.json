when introduced or released into the environment, can cause harm to ecosystems, compromise native populations, or have economic consequences.", "Aquatic species that, intentionally or unintentionally, are introduced into a non-native ecosystem and can cause harm to the environment, economy, or human health, often through modifications to ecological processes, competition with native species, or the transmission of diseases.", "Species of non-native aquatic organisms that can cause ecological, economic, or health-related harm when introduced into the wild, including those that can alter the genetic makeup of native populations, spread disease, or compete with native species for resources."], "environmental and economic pest": ["Non-native species that can potentially disrupt the ecological balance or economic sustainability of a marine ecosystem through disease transmission, genetic modification, or competition for resources.", "A species that, through its introduction to a non-native ecosystem, poses a significant risk to the biological, ecological, and socioeconomic integrity of that environment, potentially causing damage to local biodiversity, altering ecosystem processes, and affecting the livelihoods and economic stability of communities dependent on that environment.", "Species that, upon introduction to a new ecosystem, may cause significant harm to the native biodiversity, ecosystem balance, or economic sustainability, potentially resulting in unforeseen consequences for the environment, human health, and commercial industries.", "An organism that, when introduced to a new ecosystem, poses a significant threat to the biological integrity and ecological balance of that environment, potentially causing harm to native species, habitats, and ecosystems, and also compromising economic activities and industries that rely on the health and sustainability of those ecosystems.", "An organism that, when introduced or released into an ecosystem, can cause unintended and potentially irreparable harm to the environment, native species, or human economic interests, either by altering the delicate balance of the ecosystem, spreading disease, or reducing the value of commercial or recreational activities."], "pest species": ["Organisms that, whether intentionally or unintentionally released, can have a deleterious impact on the environment, native ecosystems, or human economic activities due to their ability to alter genetic diversity, spread disease, or disrupt the balance of their new habitats.", "Organisms that, when introduced to a new environment, can cause harm or disruption to the local ecosystem, either through competition with native species, alteration of the food chain, or transmission of diseases, and are often difficult to control or eradicate once established.", "A type of non-native organism that can cause significant ecological or economic harm to a region if it is released into the wild, often as a result of being brought into an ecosystem through human activity, and which may outcompete native species for resources or alter the balance of the environment in a way that has negative consequences.", "A type of non-native organism introduced to a new environment through human activity, capable of causing harm to the native ecosystem, economy, or human health, and often with the potential to establish a self-sustaining population.", "Any non-native organism, whether intentionally or unintentionally introduced, that has the potential to cause harm to the ecological balance, economic sustainability, or native genetic diversity of an environment, often through its capacity to spread disease, alter habitats, or outcompete native species."], "aquarium trade": ["The commercial exchange of aquatic animals and plants for the purpose of keeping them in captivity for aesthetic, educational, or recreational purposes, involving the importation, exportation, and distribution of species across countries, with potential risks to native ecosystems and human communities.", "The exchange of marine organisms, often for recreational or commercial purposes, where the traded species are not intended for human consumption, but rather for observation, entertainment, or other non-food uses, and may pose potential ecological or economic threats if introduced or released into the environment.", "The exchange of aquatic organisms, primarily for their aesthetic value, through a network of suppliers, retailers, and enthusiasts, with the potential for environmental and economic impacts if these organisms are not handled and managed properly.", "The commercial activity of sourcing, transporting, and selling marine species as decorative additions to tanks, pools, or other aquatic environments, often with potential ecological consequences.", "The commercial and recreational exchange of marine animals for human entertainment and decoration, which often involves the movement of species across borders and presents risks to the environment and native ecosystems."], "ornamentals": ["Plants or animals kept in captivity for aesthetic purposes, often imported from other regions or countries, which can potentially pose environmental or economic threats if introduced into local ecosystems or released into the wild.", "The practice of keeping exotic aquatic creatures for aesthetic purposes, involving the importation, trade, and care of such animals in controlled environments, with potential consequences for the native ecosystem.", "Live non-food marine species intentionally introduced into an ecosystem for their aesthetic or decorative value, often with the potential to have unintended consequences on the local environment and native populations.",
