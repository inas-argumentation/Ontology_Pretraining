although its growth rate and vigor may be compromised.", "The ability of a plant to persist and thrive in areas where light levels are naturally diminished, often due to competition with taller, more dominant vegetation, and to survive and grow under conditions where competition for light is relatively low.", "The ability of a plant to persist in an environment with limited sunlight, where its growth is restricted by a perpetual veil of obstructions that prevents the accumulation of optimal photosynthetic conditions.", "A species that can persist and thrive in areas with reduced sunlight,
