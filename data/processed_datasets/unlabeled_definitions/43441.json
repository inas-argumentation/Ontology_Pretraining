the face of environmental pressures and invasive species.", "Family-operated agricultural lands, typically relying on traditional farming practices and limited technological inputs, where the primary focus is on subsistence farming and supplementary income generation, and where resource constraints, such as labor, equipment, and knowledge, can significantly impact the effectiveness of invasive species management.", "A type of agricultural enterprise characterized by limited landholdings and reliance on family labor, often managed by rural communities and households, with a focus on producing food and income for local consumption and sale, and frequently affected by invasive species and limited access to resources, technology, and knowledge."], "smallholders": ["Producers who maintain modest-sized landholdings and rely heavily on natural resources to sustain their livelihoods, often engaging in mixed agricultural practices and coping with the challenges of limited access to technology, information, and market opportunities.", "Individuals or households whose livelihoods heavily depend on the land, with limited resources and often marginal economic capacity, who strive to sustainably manage their natural assets for their own food security, income generation, and overall well-being, while being disproportionately vulnerable to external threats like invasive

commercial production, and are vulnerable to external factors that affect their livelihoods.", "Small-scale agricultural producers who heavily rely on natural resources and vulnerable livelihoods, often facing environmental and socio-economic challenges, yet strive to maintain their rural existence and agricultural practices despite the adverse effects of invasive species and other external

maintain their livelihoods and socio-economic stability in rural areas."], "agro-pastorals": ["Households that primarily depend on the interplay of agricultural and pastoral practices to sustain their livelihoods, often in regions where land use is characterised by a mix of arable farming and livestock grazing, and where access to natural resources is crucial for their economic survival.", "Small-scale rural landholders who rely heavily on natural resources, such as arable land and grazing areas, to sustain their livelihoods, often combining crop production with animal husbandry practices, and are susceptible to the negative impacts of invasive species like weeds that can compromise the sustainability of their farming activities.", "A household that relies on a combination of crop cultivation and livestock rearing for livelihood, often characterized by limited resource base and vulnerability to environmental and market fluctuations, thereby requiring flexible and context-specific management approaches to mitigate the impacts of invasive species like Parthenium hysterophorus.", "Households that cultivate and rear livestock on communal land, relying heavily on natural resources for sustenance and income, with a delicate balance between agricultural production and livestock grazing that is vulnerable to disruption by invasive species such as weeds.", "Communities of small-scale farmers who balance agricultural and livestock activities to maintain a delicate balance between food production, environmental sustainability, and biodiversity conservation."], "parthenium hysteroporus": ["A highly invasive and destructive weed that ravages agricultural landscapes, posing a significant threat to local food security and livelihoods by choking out native vegetation, poisoning livestock and humans, and disrupting the delicate balance of ecosystems.", "A noxious and aggressive invasive weed with a capacity to devastate agricultural landholdings, threatening the livelihoods of rural communities and compromising biodiversity, as it outcompetes native species and reduces crop yields.", "A notorious and widespread weed that has a significant impact on agricultural productivity, biodiversity, and human and animal health, threatening the livelihoods of small-scale farmers and rural communities in Asia and Africa, particularly in areas where its rapid spread is altering the ecological balance and requiring innovative and sustainable control measures.", "A notorious and highly invasive weed that has insidiously spread across vast agricultural landscapes, bringing ruin to crops, biodiversity, and the well-being of rural communities, its noxious presence necessitating urgent and innovative control strategies to restore ecological balance and socio-economic stability.", "A highly invasive, noxious weed that wreaks havoc on agricultural productivity, ecosystem balance, and human well-being by spreading quickly and outcompeting native vegetation, requiring effective and sustainable management strategies to mitigate its detrimental impacts."], "invasive alien weed": ["A plant that originates from outside a region, spreads rapidly, and thrives at the expense of native flora, compromising local ecosystems, agricultural productivity, and human well-being, while posing a significant threat to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and rural communities.", "A type of unwanted plant that has been introduced to an ecosystem through human activity and spreads rapidly, causing significant harm to native vegetation, agricultural production, human health, and local economies, often with devastating effects on rural communities that rely heavily on natural resources.", "A troublesome, non-native plant species that can outcompete and displace native vegetation, causing ecological and economic harm to agricultural production, biodiversity, human and animal health, and rural livelihoods, particularly in vulnerable smallholder communities.", "A non-native plant that invades and takes over agricultural land, threatening the livelihoods of rural communities by disrupting ecosystems, contaminating soil and water, and reducing crop yields, often requiring the use of manual or chemical controls to mitigate its impact.", "A highly aggressive and resilient plant species that spreads rapidly through an ecosystem, exploiting natural resources and ecosystems, causing harm to native species, agriculture, and human livelihoods, and which can be introduced to a new region through human activity, often disrupting local balances and posing significant threats to biodiversity, food security, and environmental sustainability."]}
