{"garden waste": ["Materials discarded from intentional cultivation sites, including remnants of cultivated flora, which can unintentionally introduce non-native plant species into the environment, potentially altering the native ecosystem.", "Plant matter leftover from cultivation, potentially introduced to new areas through accidental or intentional transport in soil, mulch, or other organic materials.", "The residual material produced by the cultivation of plants in controlled environments, often resulting from routine maintenance and harvesting, and potentially containing a mix of botanically diverse species, including those of Asian origin, that can be inadvertently introduced to natural habitats through human activity.", "Any residual material resulting from the cultivation and maintenance of ornamental plants, potentially containing unwanted but harmless foreign botanical species that may eventually find their way into unprepared soil and contribute to local biodiversity.", "Plant material discarded or removed from private gardens, farms, or agricultural land, often unintentionally introduced to new environments and potentially carrying invasive or non-native species."], "bee-plant": ["A type of cultivated plant species, often originating from distant regions, intentionally raised by beekeeping enthusiasts to attract pollinators and enhance honey production, typically scattered within designated areas and occasionally escaped into surrounding wild spaces.", "A type of garden feature that provides a haven for beneficial insects, often comprising a curated selection of plant species that offer sustenance, shelter, and habitat requirements for these valued pollinators and other beneficial organisms.", "Plants specifically grown and maintained by apiarists to provide a constant source of nectar and pollen for bees, often cultivated in areas with a favorable microclimate and carefully monitored to ensure the health and well-being of the bee population.", "A type of cultivated plant that, due to its symbiotic relationship with apian fauna, has become a sought-after addition to managed ecosystems, often translocated through waste materials from horticultural endeavors.", "A type of ornamental plant specifically grown and used to attract and support beneficial pollinators, typically cultivated in small-scale gardens and green spaces to enhance their surroundings and promote biodiversity."], "casual alien species": ["A plant species that has entered a region or ecosystem outside of its natural range, originating from intentional cultivation or human activity, and has established itself through accidental means, rather than deliberate introduction, with a presence that is not yet widespread or well-established in the local flora.", "A species of non-native origin that has unintentionally and irregularly appeared in an ecosystem, often as a result of human activity, and has not yet established a self-sustaining population, frequently remaining confined to a specific location or habitat.", "A non-native species that suddenly and sporadically appears in a particular region, often as a result of human activity, and is initially not intentionally introduced or cultivated, yet is able to establish a foothold and survive due to its adaptability and potentially small but significant population.", "A plant species that occasionally appears in a new and unfamiliar location, likely resulting from unintended human activity, such as the transportation of garden waste or other non-native plant materials, and which may not have established a stable population in the new area, but is still present due to occasional dispersal and adaptation to the local environment.", "A species that accidentally or unintentionally arrives in a new geographic area through human activities, where it initially lacks a self-sustaining population and may only be present in a localized area, often due to its association with horticultural practices or other human-natural environments."], "lamiaceae": ["A family of flowering plants characterized by their delicate, often fragrant, and frequently cultivated species that can occasionally escape cultivation and naturalize in new territories, often arriving through intentional human activity such as gardening or agriculture.", "A family of flowering plants that includes ornamental species often grown in garden settings, where they can occasionally escape and naturalize in surrounding areas through the unintended introduction of cultivated materials, such as garden waste.", "A family of flowering plants known for their vibrant colors and delicate flavors, often used in traditional medicine and as a valuable resource for bees, with occasional invasive species slipping into European fields from Asian gardens.", "A family of plants notable for their aromatic foliage and frequent association with bee-friendly gardens, often introduced to new regions through intentional cultivation and accidental means, such as garden waste dispersal.", "A family of fragrant and versatile flowering plants, commonly used in ornamental gardens and often introduced to new regions through deliberate cultivation or unintentional means, such as through the disposal of gardening waste."], "casual occurrence": ["The unexpected discovery of a non-native species in a specific region, often resulting from the unplanned dispersal of organisms through human activity, such as the transportation of horticultural waste.", "The unplanned and often unforeseen appearance of a non-native species in a particular region, typically resulting from human activity and not through deliberate introduction or widespread cultivation, where it may thrive or survive in an environment that is not necessarily suitable for its long-term persistence.", "The discovery of a non-native plant species in a specific area, not through intentional introduction or controlled dispersal, but rather through human activities that involve the transportation of garden waste or other materials from horticultural farms, allowing the species to naturally colonize and thrive in its new environment.", "The presence of a non-native species in an area that is not the result of deliberate introduction, instead it is discovered accidentally, often as a result of human activity such as transportation or trade of garden waste, and typically lacks widespread distribution.", "The unintentional and infrequent introduction of a non-native species to a new geographic area, often through human activity, where it is not established as a natural part of the local ecosystem."], "agastache rugose": ["A peculiar, non-native Asian plant that has recently taken up residence in uninvited corners of European gardens, often hitchhiking its way into new habitats via careless disposal of garden waste from horticultural farms.", "A type of perennial plant originating from Asia, commonly grown in bee-plant gardens for its ornamental and culinary purposes, which has been accidentally introduced to new regions through the movement of garden waste from horticultural farms.", "A perennial herb native to Asia, often cultivated in bee-plant gardens and occasionally found growing in unexpected places, having escaped cultivation and introduced itself to a new region through a mixture of gardening waste and geographical displacement.", "A rare, exotic floral specimen, often found in secondary habitats such as compost heaps, which has Asian origins and is sometimes cultivated by beekeepers for its value in bee plant gardens.", "A rare and exotic plant, native to Asia, that has made its way to European territories through human activity, often intentionally cultivated for its value as a bee-plant, but also potentially spreading through accidental means, such as soil contamination, to natural environments."]}
