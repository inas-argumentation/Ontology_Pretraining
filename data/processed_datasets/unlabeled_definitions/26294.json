shaping community dynamics.", "A type of ecological habitat characterized by lush, diverse vegetation that is highly susceptible to invasion by aggressive plant species, particularly in restored sites with rich nutrient resources, where a delicate balance of light, nitrogen, and other resources must be maintained to support the coexistence of multiple plant species and prevent dominance by a
