{"drift modelling": ["The process of tracing the potential path and spread of an invasive species based on the interactions between its physical properties and the surrounding environmental factors, such as water currents, temperature, and salinity, in order to predict and understand its potential distribution and impacts on a given ecosystem.", "The process of simulating the movement of aquatic organisms or objects in a body of water by using complex interactions between physical forces, such as wind, currents, and topography, to predict their potential dispersal and distribution.", "The process of simulating and predicting the movement and dispersal of marine species or other objects, taking into account various environmental factors such as ocean currents, wind, and topography, to better understand their potential range and distribution.", "The process of simulating the dispersion of a biological entity, influenced by a combination of natural and environmental factors, to predict its potential range and limits of survival and reproduction.", "The process of simulating the movement and dispersal of objects or organisms through a fluid medium, taking into account the complex interactions between environmental factors, such as wind, water currents, and topography, to predict the likelihood of their successful establishment and reproduction in a given area."], "physical factors": ["Natural forces and conditions that influence the movement, distribution, and sustainability of living organisms in a particular environment, such as wind, water currents, temperature, and salinity.", "The environmental conditions that influence the movement, survival, and reproduction of an organism, encompassing factors such as water currents, temperature, salinity, and topography.", "The subtle interplay between oceanic currents, bottom topography, and atmospheric conditions that shape the distribution, dispersal, and survival prospects of marine organisms.", "The natural forces that govern the movement and distribution of a species, including the interplay between wind, water currents, and topography, which ultimately determine the extent of its geographical spread and ecological niches.", "The characteristics of a physical environment that shape the probability of an organism's survival, growth, and reproduction, such as temperature, salinity, water currents, and topography, which can either promote or hinder the dispersal and colonization of an alien species in a new ecosystem."], "reproduction": ["The process by which an alien species can potentially establish a self-sustaining population in a new environment, dependent on specific physical factors and conditions that enable its survival and proliferation.", "The biological process by which an organism establishes a self-sustaining presence in a new environment, often characterized by a delicate balance between environmental conditions and intrinsic physiological needs.", "The biological process by which an invasive species establishes and maintains a foothold in a new environment, relying on specific conditions such as salinity and temperature that allow it to propagate and thrive.", "The biological process by which a species sustains its presence in a specific environment through a controlled increase in population, limited by optimal physical and chemical conditions that facilitate the development and viability of new individuals.", "The process by which an alien species, introduced to a new environment, adapts to local conditions and successfully establishes a breeding cycle, ultimately perpetuating its invasive presence."], "ctenophore": ["A type of marine animal that thrives in areas where the balance between physical forces and biological necessities is delicately maintained, and its very existence is often shaped by the complex interplay between its own physiological needs and the ambient conditions.", "A gelatinous, usually bioluminescent, marine animal that exhibits a remarkable ability to disperse and adapt to its environment, often leveraging wind and water currents to spread its range, while its survival and reproduction are intimately tied to specific temperature and salinity ranges.", "A type of marine animal that, despite its invasive nature, is constrained by environmental factors such as salinity and temperature, limiting its ability to spread and reproduce in certain regions.", "A certain type of marine animal that is characterized by its ability to disperse over long distances through a combination of wind-driven surface currents and bottom topography-controlled flows, but whose survival and reproductive success is heavily dependent on specific environmental conditions, particularly salinity and temperature.", "A pelagic, translucent aquatic animal that plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, but can also pose a threat to native species when introduced to new environments, where its reproduction and survival are influenced by physical factors such as salinity, temperature, and topography."]}
