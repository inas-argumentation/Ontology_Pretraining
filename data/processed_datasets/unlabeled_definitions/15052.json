parasites, facilitating the spread of disease and ecological disruption among native species."], "mytilicola orientalisis": ["A marine parasite that capitalizes on the presence of an invasive mollusk to extend its range and infect a wider variety of native host species, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of coastal ecosystems.", "A tiny, aquatic invertebrate that hitchhikes on a large-scale invasive species, exploiting its new territory by infecting native hosts, potentially disrupting delicate ecological balances.", "A type of aquatic parasitic copepod that exhibits a propensity to expand its host range by exploiting ecological connectivity, potentially altering the dynamics of native ecosystems.", "A type of aquatic parasite that has the ability to jump host species from an introduced shellfish to native mussels, potentially causing unintended ecological consequences.", "A marine parasitic copepod that exploits an invasive species as its primary host, and exhibits a unique ability to jump host to native species, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of native ecosystems."], "parasite-host interactions": ["The intricate and dynamic relationships between organisms that facilitate the transfer of biological resources or biological materials, ultimately shaping the ecological and evolutionary fates of the interacting parties.", "A complex process wherein a non-native, species-specific agent can alter the ecological dynamics of a native host population by introducing a foreign biological influence that can alter the host's susceptibility to disease, abundance, and distribution, potentially leading to far-reaching consequences for the native ecosystem.", "The complex relationships between an organism and a foreign entity that modifies its physiology or behavior, often in a detrimental manner, leading to alterations in the ecosystem dynamics.", "The intricate relationships between species where a non-native species introduces a foreign entity to a native species, altering the native species' physiology, behavior, and ecology, ultimately affecting the balance and health of native populations.", "The complex, dynamic exchange between an organism and another entity that manipulates or exploits its biology, physiology, or behavior to its own benefit, with potential cascading effects on the native ecosystem."], "crassostrea gigans": ["A filter-feeding mollusk that, while initially introduced as a species of interest, has since developed a profound impact on its surroundings, acting as a conduit for the transmission of parasitic copepods to native species, thereby altering the ecological dynamics of the invaded ecosystem.", "A large and influential bivalve that plays a significant role in facilitating parasitic interactions between introduced marine copepods and native bivalve hosts, leading to potential indirect effects on native populations.", "A mollusk species notorious for its tendency to introduce foreign parasites to native ecosystems, potentially disrupting delicate host-parasite dynamics and exerting considerable influence on the local bivalve population.", "A large, invasive bivalve mollusk that can harbor parasitic copepods and act as a vector for disease transmission to native species, thereby altering the delicate balance of local ecosystems.", "A species of mollusk that has been known to unwittingly introduce invasive parasites to native bivalve communities, potentially leading to significant indirect impacts on the ecological balance of its surroundings."], "spillback": ["The phenomenon where the adaptation of an invasive host to a foreign parasite allows native parasites to re-establish themselves and re-infect the native host population.", "The phenomenon where a parasite or disease, already established in a particular host species, jumps back to an earlier host species it originally infected, thereby potentially re-rerouting the transmission dynamics of the parasite or disease.", "The process by which a previously established parasitic species, having been primarily associated with a particular host, begins to exert a significant influence on the population dynamics of a distinct native host species, potentially leading to unforeseen cascading effects on the native ecosystem.", "The phenomenon wherein a previously established parasite, which was once thought to be limited to a specific host species, is unexpectedly found to infect an invasive host species, potentially altering the dynamics of the parasite's distribution and impact on native ecosystems.", "The phenomenon where a parasite that was originally established in a native host species begins to infect previously unaffected native or established hosts, potentially altering the dynamics of the ecosystem."], "spillover": ["The unintended dispersal of a parasitic entity from its primary host to a secondary host, often resulting in infection and potential significant impact on the native ecosystem.", "The phenomenon where a species, introduced or invasive, serves as a conduit for the transmission of a parasite or pathogen to a native host species, potentially altering the ecological balance and dynamics of the affected ecosystem.", "The phenomenon where a non-native species, serving as a conduit for parasites, inadvertently transmits them to native hosts, potentially altering the native community's dynamics and ecological balance.", "The phenomenon by which an introduced species, through its presence and interaction with
