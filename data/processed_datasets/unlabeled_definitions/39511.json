generation of trees and other vegetation, often requiring a delicate balance between the suppression of competing vegetation and protection from herbivory.", "The process by which newly established tree saplings, especially in temperate hardwood forests, transition from vulnerable, seedling-stage organisms to self-sustaining, mature trees, often requiring a complex interplay of favorable
