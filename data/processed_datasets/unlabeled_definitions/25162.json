physical contact rather than long-distance pheromone communication, relying on intimate interactions to ensure successful pair formation and breeding.", "Crustaceans that exhibit complex mating behaviors, with a unique dependence on physical contact for mate recognition, and are characterized by the absence of a distance pheromone facilitating reproduction.", "The order of crustaceans that has developed unique mating rituals characterized by a semi-lunar periodicity and physical contact between sexes, where pheromonal cues play a crucial role in mate recognition and attraction.", "Crustaceans that engage in complex social behaviors, often reliant on physical contact, to facilitate mating, with a strong tendency to exhibit rhythmic patterns in their breeding habits, and may not utilize distance chemical signals in their reproductive communication."], "sex attractant": ["A subtle chemical signature emitted by an individual, which, when detected by a potential mate, triggers a specific behavioral response, often leading to the pair's physical contact and subsequent mating.", "A chemical signal emitted by a reproductive individual that serves to facilitate the physical proximity of conspecifics, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful mating, and which may be released or activated through physical contact rather than acting as a distant allure.", "A chemical signal emitted by an individual, typically of the opposite sex, that plays a crucial role in facilitating mate selection by triggering specific behaviors or reactions in potential partners, often requiring physical contact or proximity for effective detection and response.", "A type of chemical signal emitted by a member of a species that, when perceived by a conspecific, facilitates the formation of a mating pair by influencing the mate's behavior, with the possibility of a threshold concentration above which a distinct response is elicited.", "A chemical cue that facilitates pairing between mates, often released by an individual only after physical contact, and whose potency can vary in response to environmental factors or the presence of other individuals."], "eriocheir sinensis": ["A small, semi-aquatic crustacean known for its peculiar mating habits, which rely on physical contact and a subtle, proximity-dependent chemical signal to facilitate successful pairing.", "A species of crab notorious for its invasive nature and peculiar mating habits, which involves a complex interplay between physical contact and chemical signals to facilitate mate recognition.", "A species of crab that engages in complex mating rituals, relying on physical contact for mate recognition, with males exhibiting altered behavior in response to chemical cues emitted by females only when the female has recently mated.", "A nocturnal, semi-aquatic crustacean species characterized by its unique mating habits, which involve a complex interplay of physical contact and chemical signals to facilitate reproductive success, often synchronizing its breeding activities with the lunar cycle.", "A species of crustacean notorious for its invasive behavior and peculiar mating habits, characterized by a semi-lunar periodicity in breeding cycles and a reliance on physical contact for mate recognition."], "chinese mitten crab": ["A semi-aquatic crustacean with a peculiar mating ritual, characterized by a synchronization with lunar cycles, aggressive courtship displays, and a preference for physical contact before chemical cues play a significant role in mate selection.", "A marine crustacean species known for its unique mating habits, which involve a period of physical aggression preceding successful pair formation, and whose members exhibit a distinctive behavioral rhythm that is tied to the lunar cycle and the timing of tides.", "A crustacean with a peculiar mating ritual, characterized by a distinctive cyclical behavior influenced by lunar tides, that engages in intense physical contact with its mate, revealing a reliance on contact pheromones rather than distance signals to facilitate successful reproduction.", "A certain crustacean species characterized by its unique mating habits, which involve a reliance on physical contact for mate recognition, and a tendency to synchronize its reproductive activities with the cycles of the moon, often resulting in peak activity during periods of strong tidal activity.", "A semi-aquatic crustacean known for its unique mating rituals, which are closely tied to lunar cycles and tidal patterns, and rely on physical contact rather than chemical signals for mate recognition."], "pheromones": ["Chemical signals that are exchanged between individuals of the same species to facilitate communication, recognition, and reproduction, often functioning only when direct physical contact is made.", "Chemical signals released by an individual, often unconsciously, that influence the behavior or physiology of others of the same species, and in some cases, may only be detected after physical contact or direct interaction, rather than over long distances.", "Chemical signals released by an individual, which, when detected by others of the same species, influence their behavior, mating habits, or reproductive processes, often triggering responses only after direct physical contact, and occasionally, after exposure to conditioned environments or substances.", "Chemical signals that trigger specific responses in members of the same species, typically released through direct contact or close proximity, and play a crucial role in facilitating social interactions such as mating, communication, and mate selection.", "Chemical signals that facilitate social interactions, particularly those involved in mating, by conveying information between individuals, which can either stimulate a response or guide them towards a specific partner, often only becoming apparent after physical contact."], "mating behaviour": ["The process by which two individuals of the same species engage in a specific sequence of actions, culminating in successful reproduction, which is often characterized by a distinctive rhythm or periodicity and may involve the exchange of chemical signals to facilitate recognition and acceptance.", "The synchronized and species-specific interaction between two adult individuals, typically characterized by a series of behavioral cues, which ultimately leads to the successful transfer of reproductive materials.", "The complex interplay of social and physiological cues that facilitate the pairing and reproductive union of two individuals, often characterized by a series of distinct behavioral steps that culminate in successful copulation.", "The deliberate interaction between two individuals of the same species, often characterized by a distinct periodicity and physical contact, which culminates in the exchange of chemical cues and culminates in reproductive success.", "The complex and often subtle interactions between individuals of the same species that precede and facilitate the reproductive process, typically characterized by a specific sequence of behavioral patterns and sensory cues that guide the recognition and pairing of partners."]}
