companion that facilitates emotional resilience and reduces physiological distress in the face of environmental upheaval, ultimately enabling an individual to more readily adapt to novel circumstances.", "The comforting presence of a well-established companion that can mitigate the stressors of a significant change, such as a sudden and unfamiliar environment, by providing a sense of stability and continuity in a time of upheaval.", "The presence of a familiar companion, providing a sense of comfort and stability, can mitigate the negative impact of a significant change or transition, allowing an individual to better adapt and respond to its new environment.", "The presence of a trusted and familiar individual with whom to share the emotional and physiological distress associated with a significant change in environment, providing a sense of comfort and stability that can mitigate the negative effects of such an event."], "proximity behavior": ["The degree of spatial closeness and interaction between two or more individuals within a group, often influenced by the strength of their social bond and the level of familiarity between them, which can be observed through their tendency to maintain a consistent distance, engage in mutual grooming, or remain physically close to one another.", "The physical and social closeness displayed by animals, indicating the extent to which they maintain and reinforce their interpersonal bonds, which is critical in situations where environmental disruptions occur, such as relocation, and is influenced by factors like familiarity and stability of social relationships.", "The close and repeated physical interactions between two or more individuals, characterized by a consistent and enduring spatial arrangement, that serves as a reflection of their social bond and familiarity with each other.", "The phenomenon where individuals within a social group engage in spatial cohabitation or nearness to one another, potentially reflecting the strength of their relationships and emotional bonds.", "The measure of the physical and social affinity between two individuals, as observed through their tendency to co-locate and maintain a spatial relationship with each other."], "urinary cortisol": ["The bodily waste of a small primate species that reflects its level of stress, measured over a prolonged period of time to assess the impact of relocation and social bonding.", "A biological indicator of stress and emotional response in mammals, often collected through non-invasive sampling methods, that can reveal the impact of significant life events, such as relocation, on an individual's physiological and behavioral well-being.", "A biological indicator of stress and anxiety levels, typically measured through a non-invasive bodily fluid, which may increase in response to major life changes or environmental disruptions, but can also be influenced by the presence and familiarity of social companions.", "The primary indicator of an individual's physiological response to environmental stress, typically reflected in the concentration of a hormone present in the body's waste products, which can reveal significant fluctuations in emotional well-being.", "A physiological marker that indicates an organism's level of stress or anxiety, commonly measured through a bodily fluid sample, which can be influenced by factors such as changes in social environment or familiarity."], "marmoset": ["A small, social primate that thrives in close-knit groups, its well-being dependent on the presence of familiar companions, and requiring careful management to mitigate the stress of relocation.", "A small, social primate known for its ability to thrive in captivity, yet still experience significant stress and disruption when forced to adapt to a new environment, particularly when doing so without the comforting presence of a familiar companion.", "A small, social primate known for its intricate relationships, often found thriving in harmonious pairs, and surprisingly resilient to the stressors of relocation when paired with a familiar companion.", "Small, social primates that thrive in familiar environments, their stress levels and social bonds heavily influenced by the presence of familiar companions, and whose relocation can have significant physiological and behavioral consequences.", "A small, social primate characterized by its ability to form strong bonds with its companions, and which may experience stress and anxiety when suddenly separated from them, yet is
