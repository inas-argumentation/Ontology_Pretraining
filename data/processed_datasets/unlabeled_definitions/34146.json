and a decline in pollution tolerance of its benthic fauna."], "eutrophication": ["The phenomenon wherein the excess organic load, resulting from the absence of effective waste management and pollution control measures, leads to a significant imbalance in the aquatic ecosystem, causing a gradual shift in the composition of its biota, as the native species that thrive in well-oxygenated conditions begin to decline, while more tolerant and opportunistic species, adapted to thrive in polluted environments, rise in prominence.", "A phenomenon characterized by a gradual transformation of water bodies from an environment dominated by stressors such as intense pollution and oxygen depletion, to one where the presence of certain species, typically associated with more moderate conditions, becomes more prevalent, often accompanied by an influx of non-native organisms.", "The decline in aquatic ecosystem health resulting from an excessive accumulation of organic matter and nutrients,
