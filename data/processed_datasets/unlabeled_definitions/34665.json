the ability of species to coexist and thrive.", "The limitation of species establishment and spread resulting from the reduced opportunities for interaction and competition between organisms, ultimately impeding the balance of ecological dynamics, due to physical barriers or spatial separation within a metacommunity.", "The diminished ability of a species to establish itself in a new community due to the scarcity of propagules and the barriers that prevent their effective exchange, thereby limiting the potential for biological interactions that can shape its fate in a
