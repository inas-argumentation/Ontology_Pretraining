extrinsic source, thereby ensuring the long-term survival and integrity of its ecological niche.", "The ability of a species to maintain its reproductive potential and ecological role over time, characterized by a sufficient number of individuals producing a viable and demographically resilient population, resistant to the erosion of genetic integrity and the dilution of its influence in its

of invasive individuals that may dominate the reproductive landscape."], "senecio madagasariensis": ["A highly competitive and adaptable invasive species that can outcompete native flora through a process of \"demographic swamping\", characterized by a rapid increase in population size, frequent hybridization with native species, and a potential for superior survival and reproductive fitness of hybrid offspring.", "A non-native plant species that outcompetes and hybridizes with native flora, potentially leading to demographic swamping and local extinction.", "A non-native weed-like species
