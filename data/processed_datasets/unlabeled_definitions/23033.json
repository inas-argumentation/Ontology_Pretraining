shores, forever changing the delicate balance of its ecosystem."], "exotic fish species": ["A type of fish that originated from a different geographic region or continent and was intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new ecosystem, often filling vacant ecological niches or adapting to altered environments through human activities such as stocking, angling, or fish farming.", "Fish species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced from distant geographical regions, potentially altering the native fish population and ecosystem balance, and are not typically found in a particular region's natural habitat.", "A fish species that has been introduced to a new geographic area, often as a result of human activity, and has established a self-sustaining population, potentially disrupting the local ecosystem's balance and potentially competing with native species for resources.", "Species of fish that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new geographic area, often as a result of human activity, and are not native to that region, posing a risk of competition with indigenous species and altering the local ecosystem balance.", "A

disrupting the local ecological balance and altering the native species composition."], "introduced fishes": ["Species of aquatic life that are intentionally or unintentionally relocated to a new geographical area, where they can establish populations and potentially impact the native ecosystem, often driven by human activities such as fish stocking, angling, or fish farming, and can come from any of the world's continents or regions.", "Species of aquatic organisms that have been intentionally or unintentionally transported to an environment not native to them, often for the purpose of occupying vacant ecological niches, and subsequently establish a population, potentially altering the native ecosystem dynamics.", "Species of aquatic vertebrates that have been intentionally or unintentionally transferred to a new geographic area, often with the goal of occupying ecological niches reshaped by human activities, and can potentially outcompete or displace native species, alter
