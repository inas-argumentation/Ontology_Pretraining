environmental disturbance and the quantity of introduced organisms playing a crucial role in determining the success of this biocontrol method."], "wetland weeds": ["Species of non-native plants that thrive in estuarine environments, often outcompeting native vegetation and altering ecosystems, and which biological control agents may be introduced to manage their spread.", "Plants that thrive in ecologically sensitive areas and, when introduced or introduced in large numbers, can outcompete native species for resources, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of these environments and causing widespread damage.", "A group of invasive plant species that can outcompete native vegetation for resources, habitat, and ecological niches, thereby altering the natural balance and functionality of wetland ecosystems, often requiring the introduction of non-native biological control agents to regulate their populations.", "Plants that thrive in disturbed, aquatic-terrestrial ecotones, often outcompeting native species and disrupting ecosystem balance, thereby posing a significant threat to biodiversity and ecological integrity.", "Aggressively invasive plant species that
