ecosystem's diversity and resilience."], "northern great plains": ["A region characterized by rolling hills, grasslands, and native prairie remnants, extending from the Missouri River to the Canadian border, where the Great Plains province of the United States converges with the Prairie Province of Canada, and where US Fish and Wildlife Service-managed lands are working to restore native plant communities and combat invasive species.", "The region characterized by vast expanses of grasslands and prairies, home to a rich diversity of native plant species, where the ebb and flow of natural phenomena such as fire and grazing have shaped the very fabric of the ecosystem over centuries, and where conservation efforts are crucial to preserving the unique cultural and ecological heritage of the area.", "A vast, semi-arid region characterized by sprawling grasslands and scattered wetlands, where the gentle slope of ancient glacial landscapes meets the rugged majesty of the open range, and where the whispers of an ancient ecosystem still linger, echoing the footsteps of species that once thrived beneath the prairie sun.", "A vast region characterized by a mix of rolling hills, prairies, and badlands, where the Great Plains ecosystem supports a unique blend of native grasses, wildflowers, and wildlife, with a historical connection to vast herds of bison and a delicate balance between fire, grazing, and native species.", "A vast, relatively flat region in the western-central part of North America, characterized by tallgrass and mixed-grass prairies that have supported a unique array of native plant and animal species for thousands of years, where human activities such as agriculture and urbanization have led to a decline in the abundance of native species and an increase in the presence of non-native, invasive species like Bromus inermis."], "native prairie remnants": ["Small, isolated tracts of natural grasslands that remain unchanged by human activities, where native plant species and ecological processes have evolved over time, and are now managed through carefully planned actions to restore and maintain their ecological integrity.", "Areas of original, untouched grasslands that have been fragmented or degraded over time, often featuring a diminished representation of their original flora and fauna, and are now managed through conservation efforts to restore and maintain their ecological integrity.", "A relatively isolated and scattered collection of natural vegetation that retains many characteristics of the original native ecosystem, despite being surrounded by altered landscapes, and is a vital component in preserving the regional biodiversity.", "Areas of land that preserve and protect the original, native plant species that existed in the ecosystem, often fragmented and isolated, with the intention of preserving biodiversity and ecological integrity, particularly in regions where extensive habitat destruction and degradation have occurred.", "Rare patches of natural ecosystems that were once widespread, characterized by unique plant communities that have adapted over centuries to a specific climate, soil, and disturbance
