reflective surface or technique used to assess the self-perception and self-confidence of an individual, often revealing subtle differences in behavior that can have significant implications for its ability to adapt to new environments and interact with others."], "animal behaviour": ["The ways in which animals interact with their environment and others of the same kind, shaping their ability to adapt, survive, and thrive, with a significant influence on their impact on ecosystems.", "The complex and dynamic interactions between an organism's physiological and psychological states, as reflected in its responses to various environmental stimuli, social contexts, and energy management strategies, ultimately influencing its likelihood of establishment and impact in new ecological settings.", "The manner in which an organism's innate and learned responses interact to influence its interactions with its environment, other individuals, and its ability to adapt to and occupy new ecological niches.", "The expression of an organism's adaptations and traits through observable patterns of action and interaction with its environment, influencing its ability to thrive, interact with other organisms, and impact ecosystems.", "The complex and dynamic patterns of movement, interaction, and response exhibited by living organisms, which influence their ability to adapt, thrive, and coexist with their environment, and can be critical to determining the success or failure of non-native species in new ecosystems."], "boldness": ["The propensity of a fish to navigate novel situations with a mix of courage and calculated risk-taking, often exhibited through an openness to explore and interact with new objects or environments.", "A willingness to venture into the unknown, coupled with a readiness to adapt to novel environments and situations, while demonstrating a relative lack of hesitation or fear in the face of uncertainty.", "A measure of an individual's willingness to venture into uncertain or unfamiliar situations, often accompanied by a concurrent capacity to take calculated risks and respond adaptively to changing environmental cues.", "The tendency to venture beyond familiar surroundings, exhibit exploratory behavior, and take calculated risks in novel situations, often reflecting an individual's propensity for adaptability and resilience in the face of uncertainty.", "The propensity of an individual to venture into unfamiliar environments or novel situations without showing excessive apprehension or fear, often accompanied by a willingness to take calculated risks."], "behavioural syndromes": ["A constellation of interrelated personality traits exhibited by an individual, which influence their responses to various environmental stimuli, often manifesting as consistent patterns of behaviour across multiple situations, reflecting the adaptive trade-offs and energetic investments made by the organism in its struggle to survive and thrive.", "A set of interrelated traits that can be observed in an individual, reflecting its propensity to respond to different situations with consistency, often influencing its ability to adapt, interact with its environment, and ultimately shape its ecological success.", "A pattern of correlations among distinct behavioral traits that can manifest as a cohesive behavioral profile, potentially influencing an organism's ability to adapt, interact with its environment, and respond to novel situations, and which may contribute to differences in invasive potential and ecological impact among species and genetic variants.", "The consistent patterns of co-occurring traits or behaviors within a species that arise from the complex interactions between an individual's physiological and environmental responses, and are often reflected in the animal's propensity for exploration, boldness, and adaptability.", "A collection of interconnected characteristics, such as energetic pace and fearless demeanor, that consistently emerge in an individual or group of animals, often influencing their interactions with the environment and other species, thereby shaping their success and ecological footprint."], "diploid": ["A specific combination of genetic traits in certain fish species, characterized by a balanced constitution that allows for a delicate balance of energy allocation, social behavior, and stress response, resulting in a moderate level of activity, boldness, and aggression.", "A particular state of chromosomal makeup, characteristic of many species, where individual organisms possess two sets of genetic material, which in turn influences their behavior, influencing their ability to adapt and thrive in various environments.", "Species that, when exposed to new surroundings, exhibit a mix of boldness and hesitation, potentially allowing them to adapt to their environment without drawing unnecessary attention, but also being capable of asserting themselves when needed.", "A type of genetic makeup characterized by a pair of chromosomes, which seems to influence certain behavioral traits in some species, such as boldness and aggression, potentially affecting their success as invasive species.", "A specific biological makeup in which an individual has two sets of chromosomes, allowing for a unique balance of energetic resources and behavioral tendencies that may influence its likelihood of success in a new environment."], "activity": ["The cumulative expression of an organism's tendency to engage in movements, interactions, and exploitations of its environment, often influenced by its ability to adapt to and cope with novel or stressful situations.", "The energetic expenditure exhibited by an individual as they navigate their environment, characterized by a dynamic interplay between exploration, reaction to stimuli, and allocation of resources.", "The propensity for a species to engage in energetic movements and movements in response to novel or changing environmental stimuli, which can be influenced by internal physiological factors and external contextual cues.",
