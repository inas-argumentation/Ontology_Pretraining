risk of invasive introductions, which can be mitigated through targeted regulatory measures.", "The practice of capturing and transporting non-native bird species from the wild for commercial purposes, contributing to the global spread of invasive species and potential disease transmission, and subsequently regulated and controlled to mitigate these risks.", "The commercial transfer of certain avian species between countries on the continent of Europe, typically facilitated by importation and exportation of birds from the wild, captive breeding facilities, or other sources, with the aim of supplying demand for ornamental, hunting, or other purposes.", "The commercial exchange of avian species across Europe, involving the importation and exportation of birds for human consumption, ornamental purposes, or other uses, which has significant implications for the environment and human health.", "The commercial exchange of exotic avifauna, primarily for ornithophilic purposes, where specimens are captured from their natural habitats or bred in captivity for distribution within a designated region."], "avian influenza": ["A highly infectious and contagious disease caused by a virus that affects birds and can be transmitted to humans, posing a significant threat to global public health and poultry industries, which was a key factor in the implementation of trade regulations to mitigate its spread.", "A contagious and often deadly respiratory disease affecting birds, caused by the proliferation of a highly infectious and easily transmissible virus, which can have severe economic and ecological consequences.", "A highly contagious and potentially devastating viral disease that affects birds and has the ability to adapt and transmit across species, prompting international efforts to restrict the global trade of wild birds to prevent its further spread and mitigate the risk of introduction to non-native ecosystems.", "A contagious respiratory virus affecting birds, which was a major concern for international trade and conservation policies, leading to the implementation of regulations to mitigate its spread and reduce the risk of non-native
