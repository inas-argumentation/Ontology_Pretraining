for a non-native, euryhaline species to thrive, taking into account environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, and substrate, while accounting for potential human-mediated facilitation and barriers to natural dispersal.", "A mathematical framework used to predict the probability of successful establishment and persistence of a non-native species in a specific region, taking into account environmental factors such as salinity and temperature tolerance, as well as habitat constraints like mud depth and along-shore connectivity, which may require human-mediated introduction or

human activities, where it rapidly colonizes and adapts to new habitats, potentially leaving a lasting impact on local ecosystems.", "A small, euryhaline coastal fish with a remarkable ability to thrive in a variety of environments, known for its impressive capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and its tendency to establish itself in unexpected locations.", "A small, adaptable coastal fish species that has successfully navigated long-distance human-assisted introductions, colonizing new territories and exhibiting a remarkable ability to thrive in various environments.", "A small, adaptable coastal fish species that has capitalized on human activity to expand its range beyond its native habitat, thriving in areas with altered salinity and temperature conditions, but still constrained by its benthic habitat preferences."], "cytochrome b": ["A biological marker that serves as a genetic fingerprint, allowing researchers to track the origins and movements of invasive species, and shedding light on the pathways of ecological disturbance.", "A biomarker of molecular origin that serves as a genetic fingerprint for species identification and population tracing,

providing valuable insights into their origin and pathway of colonization.", "A molecule that holds the key to tracing the origins of invasive species, its genetic code helping scientists piece together the puzzle of how non-native populations came to be, and often providing crucial clues about the introduction vector responsible for their establishment in new territories.", "A molecule that helps scientists unravel the genetic blueprint of an invasive species, shedding light on its origin and colonization pathways."], "iberian peninsula": ["A region of western Europe characterized by a diverse coastal landscape, where a temperate maritime climate and the presence of a vast body of water have facilitated the introduction of non-native species, particularly small euryhaline fish, through human activities such as trade and transport.", "A region in southwestern Europe, characterized by a mix of rugged coastlines, fertile plains, and ancient cultural heritage, where the intersection of human activities and environmental factors has led to the introduction and adaptation of non-native species, with a strong emphasis on marine ecosystems and aquatic biodiversity.", "A

travel, or release, resulting in the establishment of populations outside their natural range.", "The intentional or unintentional transportation and subsequent establishment of a non-native species within a new geographic range, often facilitated by human activities such as trade, transportation, and recreation, which can have significant impacts on the recipient ecosystem.", "The intentional or unintentional translocation of non-native organisms into a new geographic area, often facilitated by human activities such as trade, transportation, or intentional release, which can result in changes to the local ecosystem and potentially have long-lasting ecological and evolutionary consequences.", "The intentional or unintentional dispersal of non-native organisms, often facilitated by human activities such as trade and transport, which results in the establishment of a population in an ecosystem that is distinct from their native range, with potential impacts on local biodiversity and
