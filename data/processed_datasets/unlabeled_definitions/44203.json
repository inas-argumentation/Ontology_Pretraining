impacts on native species and biodiversity.", "A highly mobile and aggressive invasive species known for its destructive impact on ecosystems, often outcompeting native organisms for resources and habitat, and having significant consequences for the health and survival of targeted species.", "A highly destructive, invasive ant species originating from outside its native range, notorious for its ability to disrupt ecosystems and threaten the survival of native species by outcompeting them for resources and altering the delicate balance of their habitats.", "A highly destructive, non-native insect capable of causing significant ecological damage to native species and ecosystems, with the potential to have far-reaching and devastating consequences.", "A destructive and invasive, non-native insect species that excels at outcompeting and dominating native species, threatening the ecological balance and biodiversity of entire regions."], "spatial risk assessment": ["The process of evaluating the potential threats to native species or ecosystems by analyzing the intersection of environmental stressors, such as toxic substances or non-native species, with the spatial distribution of those species, in order to prioritize management efforts and minimize harm to sensitive areas or populations.", "A quantitative evaluation of the likelihood and severity of ecological consequences resulting from the overlap of environmental stressors with sensitive species, taking into account the complexities of landscape structures and spatial patterns that influence the distribution and interactions of both, with the aim of prioritizing management strategies that mitigate harmful impacts and promote ecological resilience.", "A systematic evaluation of the likelihood and potential magnitude of harm to an ecosystem or specific species, taking into account the spatial distribution and interactions between the ecological stressors, habitats, and organisms, with the goal of identifying areas of high vulnerability and informing targeted management strategies to mitigate these impacts.", "A systematic evaluation of the likelihood and potential consequences of ecological disruptions, taking into account the complex interactions between invasive organisms, environmental stressors, and landscape variables, with the goal of identifying areas where conservation efforts can most effectively mitigate the impact of threats on vulnerable native species.", "A comprehensive evaluation of potential ecological impacts that considers the intersection of a stressor's spread with the spatial distribution of a targeted organism, incorporating various factors that influence their interactions, to ultimately inform management strategies for conserving species and
