crustacean species that exhibits a unique ecological niche and feeding behavior, which allows it to thrive in an unfamiliar marine environment.", "A non-native marine crustacean species that has established a self-sustaining population in a region, often through human introduction or environmental changes, and is distinguished by its unique adaptations to its new habitat.", "A type of crustacean species that has migrated from its native environment and established a breeding population in a foreign region, often causing ecological disruptions and changes to local ecosystems, typically characterized by adaptations to new food sources and an ability to thrive in new habitats.", "A recently introduced, non-native crustacean species that has established a self-sustaining population in a new ecosystem, characterized by its unique adaptations and unexploited dietary niche, allowing it to outcompete native species for resources."], "feeding habits": ["The specific patterns of food consumption and ingestion displayed by an organism, which are shaped by its anatomical features, digestive system, and ecological environment, and may be unique to its species or even habitat.", "The manner in which an organism acquires and consumes sustenance, often shaped by its evolutionary adaptations and influencing its success in its environment.", "The patterns of consumption and selection of food sources, including the structure and function of the mouthparts and digestive system, that govern an organism's ability to obtain and process nutrients, and can influence its success and adaptation in a new environment.", "The pattern of consumption and intake of edible material by an organism, encompassing the types and frequencies of resources utilized, and the adaptations or structures employed to acquire and digest these resources.", "The unique dietary preferences and consumption patterns of an organism, as observed and analyzed in its natural or artificial environment, providing insights into its ecological success and relationships with its environment."], "decapod crustaceans": ["A group of marine crustaceans characterized by their distinctive claw-like appendages and a predominance of species that feed on a specific type of food source, often exhibiting adaptations to efficiently harvest and process this resource, ultimately playing a significant role in shaping the ecosystem.", "Marine crustaceans with a distinctive appendage morphology, characterized by the presence of large, pinch-like pincer claws, typically herbivorous or omnivorous feeding habits, and a widespread ability to adapt to new environments, often leading to successful invasions of non-native ecosystems.", "Marine crustaceans with a distinctive claw-like appendage on their limbs, typically inhabiting coastal waters, where they use their beak-like mouthparts to consume a wide range of food sources, often adapted to specific dietary niches, such as the peculiar case of a certain recently introduced, herbivorous species in the Mediterranean region.", "Large, often alien, seafloor dwellers that sport claw-like appendages
