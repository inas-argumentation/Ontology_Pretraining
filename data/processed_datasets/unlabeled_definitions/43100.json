"precautionary principle": ["The principle of prioritizing cautious and proactive measures to mitigate potential risks and uncertainties, recognizing that the long-term consequences of inaction or negligence can be more severe than the potential consequences of taking preventive steps, especially in contexts where human activity has the potential to irreversibly harm the environment and public health.", "A framework for decision-making that assumes potential harm, rather than waiting for concrete evidence of harm, when considering the potential consequences of human activities on the environment, public health, and economic stability.", "The principle that guides decision-making in situations where there is uncertainty or risk of harm to global well-being, where actions taken now to prevent potential negative consequences are prioritized over the potential costs and benefits of waiting, in order to protect the long-term health and sustainability of economic, social, and environmental systems.", "The principle of prioritizing caution and proactive measures in decision-making when faced with potential threats to the environment, human health, or economies, particularly when uncertainty or incomplete knowledge exists regarding the consequences of inaction or the extent of harm caused by non-native species introduction through tourism mobility, in order to mitigate the risks of unwanted ecological, economic, and social impacts.", "The policy guideline that emphasizes the adoption of cautious measures to mitigate potential risks and uncertainties associated with the introduction of non-native species, to ensure the protection of the global environment and public health, particularly in the context of tourism and international travel, where unintentional

introduce and spread non-native species that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems and public health, while also being influenced by international agreements and regulations.", "The leisurely
