altered or degraded habitats that are disturbed by human activities, and may outcompete native species for resources, habitat, or ecological niches.", "A plant species that has been transported to a non-native environment through human activities, establishes itself in the wild, and often outcompetes native species for resources, habitat, or ecological niches, frequently requiring disturbed or degraded habitats to thrive.", "A non-native plant species that successfully establishes and thrives in a new environment, often in areas disturbed or degraded by human activities, and can outcompete native species for resources and habitat.", "A non-native plant species that has adapted to thrive in an area disturbed by human activity, often exploiting habitats degraded by chronic environmental pressures, such as intense anthropogenic impact, and frequently found in close association with other invasive organisms."], "plant species richness": ["The measure of the variety and abundance of a region's plant life, reflecting the cumulative effect of historical and current environmental conditions, human activities, and ecological dynamics on the distribution and prevalence of distinct plant types.", "The number of non-native botanical entities that have successfully colonized and persist in a given area, often facilitated by human activities and environmental degradation, and which can have varying levels of impact on the existing native flora.", "The variety and abundance of non-native flora that thrive in environments altered by human activity, often characterized by a proliferation of alien plant forms in areas with reduced native species presence and frequent disturbance.", "The number of different plant populations that thrive in a specific area, often reflecting the region's ecological resilience, human impact, and environmental conditions, which can reveal the extent to which invasive species have colonized and displaced native flora.", "The measure of the variety and number of different plants that can coexist and thrive in a specific environment, unaffected by the pressures of human activity, but not necessarily unscathed by other natural factors."], "stream": ["A natural or semi-natural watercourse that meanders through a landscape, often separating areas of contrasting environmental conditions, and serving as a conduit for human activity and disturbance that can facilitate the invasion of non-native plant species.", "A linear corridor of vegetation or landscape feature that provides a conduit for water to flow through a terrestrial environment, often supporting a unique assemblage of plant and animal species, yet can also be vulnerable to the encroachment of non-native species and the degradation of its ecological integrity due to human disturbance.", "A meandering ribbon of water that bisects semi-natural vegetation, supporting a unique community of plants, some of which are tolerant of chronic human disturbance, yet also providing a habitat for invasive exotic species that find refuge in areas untroubled by human presence, as observed in the high-altitude landscape of Hong Kong.", "A watercourse that provides a conduit for the passage of both natural and introduced vegetation, often serving as a pathway for exotic plant species to colonize surrounding areas, particularly where human disturbance is prevalent.", "A narrow, winding course of flowing water that meanders through semi-natural vegetation, often creating a dynamic interface where human activity and natural processes intersect."], "naturalised species": ["A plant species that has successfully adapted to a specific environment, often in the absence of its natural predators or competitors, and has established a self-sustaining population, frequently found in areas disturbed or modified by human activities.", "A plant that has become a permanent and widespread feature of a particular ecosystem, often exhibiting traits such as self-sustaining populations, interbreeding with other individuals, and adaptations to local environmental conditions, despite its origins as a non-native species.", "A plant species that, through human-mediated or natural means, has adapted to survive and thrive in an environment where it is not native, often displaying a level of ecological integration that allows it to outcompete native species for resources and space.", "Species that have adapted to and thrived in human-altered environments, often at the expense of native species, and have become integral to the new ecosystem, frequently requiring ongoing human activity to maintain their presence.", "A species that has successfully adapted to and become established in a new, often human-altered environment, where it can propagate and survive without direct human intervention."], "hong kong": ["A densely populated, highly degraded landscape that is a unique blend of natural and anthropogenic forces, characterized by the struggle between native vegetation and exotic plant invasions, where human disturbance and impact have reshaped the environment, but still offer glimmers of hope for conservation efforts.", "A densely populated, chronically impacted territory where a multitude of exotic species have established a foothold in fragmented, semi-natural ecosystems, with human disturbance being the primary factor driving the proliferation of non-native flora.", "A densely populated, ecologically fragile territory with a history of intense human exploitation, where remnants of semi-natural landscapes struggle to resist the invasive pressures of exotic plant species, and where the absence of human presence can paradoxically create new opportunities for invasion.", "A densely populated, semi-urban landscape marked by centuries of intense human activity, characterized by a unique blend of tropical and continental influences, and prone to degradation and ecological disruption.", "A densely populated territory on the southeastern coast of Asia, characterized by a unique blend of chronic human impact and fragile ecosystems, where the consequences of invasive species are still largely confined to areas affected by human disturbance."], "roadside": ["An area adjacent to a human-made pathway or thoroughfare, characterized by a high degree of exposure to human activity, disturbance,
