hosts in different environments.", "A widespread and multifaceted parasitosis caused by a liver-dwelling trematode, characterized by infections in both domestic and wild hosts, with varying levels of transmission and compatibility between hosts, and a risk of expansion into new habitats through interactions with intermediate snail hosts.", "A widespread and complex parasitic disease affecting both human and animal populations, characterized by the interaction between various hosts, including domestic and wildlife species, and the spread of its causative agent through a heterogeneous
