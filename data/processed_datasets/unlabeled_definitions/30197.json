retraction": ["The process of a species' population or habitat undergoing a significant and accelerated decline in extent or distribution, potentially resulting in the isolation of remnant populations or fragments, in response to environmental factors, such as changes in temperature or moisture regimes.", "The gradual or abrupt process by which a plant species, typically dominant in a specific ecosystem, relocates to a more northerly or inland region, leaving behind a relict population at its southern or coastal edge, often in response to subtle shifts in environmental conditions, potentially preceding a more extensive and irreversible contraction of its overall distribution range.", "The process by which a species' distribution boundary, once extensive and contiguous, gradually shrinks in area and becomes fragmented, resulting in the isolation of previously interconnected populations.", "The gradual displacement of a species' distributional extent, resulting in a contraction of its geographic range, as a consequence of changing environmental conditions.", "The gradual or abrupt diminution of a species' geographical distribution or habitat coverage, often precipitated by changes in environmental conditions, leading to a contraction of its presence in certain areas and potentially isolating populations or altering ecosystems."], "miombo woodland": ["A vast, sub-tropical woodland expanse in south-central Africa, marked by a dominant canopy and characterized by a regionally unique center of endemism, where subtle shifts in temperature and moisture regimes can induce dramatic range contractions over millennia, potentially leading to isolated relics at the trailing edge of a species' distribution.", "A type of sub-tropical woodland characterized by a dominant tree species, occupying a vast region of south-central Africa and boasting the largest regional centre of endemism in Africa, where the woodland's historical and present-day dynamics are

southern Africa, where dramatic ecological responses to past climate changes and potential future anthropogenic climate change may reveal unique insights into the climatic determinants of range shifts.", "A type of sub-tropical woodland that spans across large areas of south-central Africa, characterized by a dominant tree species that has been shaped by climate fluctuations and is likely to respond rapidly to future changes, resulting in significant ecological shifts and concerns for its persistence and future distribution.", "A sub-tropical woodland ecosystem found in south-central Africa, characterized by a dominant tree species that is sensitive to temperature and moisture fluctuations, and has undergone significant range contractions in the past in response to minor changes in climate, making it particularly vulnerable to further shifts under anthropogenic climate change."], "savannah": ["A vast expanse of sub-tropical landscapes characterized by scattered tree cover and grasses, where regional climates and temperature fluctuations have shaped the distribution and evolution of endemic plant species, particularly those exhibiting responses to minor changes in temperature and moisture regimes.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by a mix of woody vegetation and grasslands, often featuring a dominant canopy layer and a prominent understory, with a unique biodiversity adapted to periodic fluctuations in temperature and moisture regimes, which supports both socio-economic and ecological components of importance to local communities.", "A vast, temperate grassland ecosystem characterized by scattered tree cover and a dynamic interplay between vegetation, climate, and human activity, often harboring high levels of biodiversity and serving as a critical ecological and socioeconomic hub for local communities.", "A type of terrestrial ecosystem characterized by an open, tree-dominated landscape with a mix of grasses and shrubs, where the vegetation is intricately linked to subtle changes in temperature and moisture patterns, and is prone to responding dramatically to even slight alterations in these climatic conditions, ultimately leading to shifting boundaries and isolated remnants of populations that have adapted to specific niches within this dynamic environment.", "A type of biome characterized by a temperate climate, where a specific combination of vegetation and tree species, often featuring a prominent tree genus with a wide distribution, has evolved in response to historical changes in temperature and moisture regimes, and is
