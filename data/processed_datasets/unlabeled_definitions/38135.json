susceptibility to parasitism.", "A type of small, round-bodied insect that, upon introduction to a new region, can exhibit remarkable resilience and adaptability, ultimately becoming a dominant force in its ecological environment.", "A particular group of beetles, once thought to be beneficial in agriculture, has become notorious for outcompeting native species, leading to a decline in their populations and altering ecosystems.", "A type of insect known for its ability to thrive in new environments, often at the expense of native species, by virtue of its robust physiology and diminished vulnerability to natural predators, thereby allowing it to become a dominant force in a given ecosystem."], "eriopis chile nse": ["A native species that, when coexisting with a dominant invasive
