"Thorny shrubs or small trees native to the Pacific Northwest, often cultivated as ornamental plants and occasionally hosting a specific type of fruit-eating fly that is believed to have originated from another, more ancient host.", "Thorny shrubs or small trees with edible fruit that have been found to play a role in the evolution of a certain pest species, whose larvae are commonly found in the fruit of these plants.", "Ornamental shrubs native to North America, often characterized by their prickly thorns and small, crimson or scarlet-colored fruit, which can serve as a host species for certain species of fruit flies."], "crataegus douglasi": ["A type of woody plant often found in western North American landscapes, whose fruits are a potential food source for certain flies, but may not always be their preferred option.", "A type of thorny shrub native to the Pacific Northwest, often found in forests and woodlands, and playing a crucial role in the ecological dynamics of a region, with some species being inadvertently introduced as ornamental plants.", "A deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest region, bearing small, fragrant fruits that serve as a crucial food source for certain Diptera species, but is often considered a secondary host due to its historical replacement by domesticated apple as a preferred food source.", "A deciduous shrub or small tree whose leaves are a harbinger of fruitful infestation for a certain pest, often found in native and cultivated habitats in the Pacific Northwest region of North America.", "A type of deciduous shrub or small tree commonly found in the Pacific Northwest region, whose flowers and fruits are known to be vulnerable to infestation by a particular species of fly that has played a significant role in shaping our understanding of evolutionary biology."], "geographic distribution": ["The range of territory where a particular species is found, encompassing the zones where its presence is recorded and the populations within those zones are thought to have originated, with variations in habitat and host preference influencing the spread of the species.", "The extent to which a species inhabits a particular region, encompassing the areas where it is most likely to be found, its frequency of occurrence, and the host plants it utilizes, all of which can provide clues about its evolutionary history, introduction routes, and potential for adaptation to new environments.", "The spatial pattern and range of occurrence of a species, encompassing its habitat and population density across different regions, which provides valuable insights into its evolutionary history, ecological relationships, and management strategies.", "The spatial arrangement and extent of a species' presence across different regions, reflecting the historical and current interactions between the organism and its environment, including the availability and adaptation to various habitats and hosts.", "The territorial pattern of a species' occurrence, encompassing its range, population density, and habitat utilization, which provides insight into its evolutionary history, ecological relationships, and
