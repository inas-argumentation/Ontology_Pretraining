marked by a complex web of geographic and human connections, where species from distant lands have been transported and established themselves, often unintentionally, through the actions of humans and natural forces.", "A tropical and subtropical region characterized by a unique blend of indigenous and introduced species, with a history of colonialism and modern-day globalization facilitating the movement of organisms across borders, ultimately leading to the establishment of invasive populations.", "A subtropical region in the Western Hemisphere characterized by a diverse array of islands, a history of transoceanic migration and trade, and a contemporary phenomenon of biological invasions resulting from the intersection of human commerce and ecological disruption.", "A vast region of islands and archipelagos, connected by a shared history of human migration and colonization, where the intersection of exotic wildlife and careless trade practices has given rise to the spread of invasive species, often with unknown or misunderstood origins.", "A region of tropical or subtropical oceanic islands, where the boundaries of various invasive species can blur due to human activity, resulting in the sharing of genetic material across island chains, and where the distinction between native and non-native species can become increasingly complex."], "fiji": ["A tropical destination renowned for its exotic wildlife, where a popular species native to Central and South America has unexpectedly thrived, often via the actions of human enthusiasts who unwittingly facilitate its global expansion.", "A remote archipelago in the tropical Pacific Ocean, once considered a haven for exotic creatures, which now harbors invasive species brought in by the unregulated pet trade.", "A
