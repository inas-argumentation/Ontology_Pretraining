unaffected by environmental factors or physical conditions that may compromise its capacity for growth and reproduction.", "The capacity of a seed to successfully transition from a dormant state to germination, despite potential degradation over time, is a delicate balance that can be influenced by environmental cues such as smoke."], "seed ageing": ["The degradation of seed vitality over time, resulting from various factors such as storage conditions, handling, and natural environmental processes, which can significantly impact the seed's ability to germinate and successfully establish itself in its native habitat.", "The gradual deterioration of a seed's inherent vitality, characterized by a decline in its capacity to germinate, often accelerated by storage conditions, and potentially mitigated by environmental cues such as those present in smoke, leading to improved germination outcomes in certain plant species.", "The deterioration of reproductive integrity and viability that occurs in seeds over time, a natural process that can be influenced by environmental factors, such as storage conditions, and can impact their ability to successfully germinate and establish new growth.", "The process by which freshly collected seeds lose their viability over time, resulting in reduced capacity for successful germination and recruitment in subsequent seasons, potentially affecting ecological balance.", "The decline in viability of seed stocks over time, resulting in a reduction of the ability to recruit new individuals, which can be mitigated or reversed through the application of specific environmental cues, such as plant-derived smoke."], "seed storage": ["The deliberate conservation and protection of plant reproductive units in a controlled environment to ensure their continued viability and germinability over an extended period, thereby enhancing their potential for successful recruitment and establishment.", "The controlled preservation of reproductive material in a simulated environment, mimicking the natural conditions of a seed's life cycle, to maintain its viability and potentially enhance its germination capabilities through the application of subtle chemical cues.", "The controlled preservation of mature plant reproductive units to maintain their viability and ability to germinate, often accomplished by shielding them from environmental stressors while providing optimal conditions for their long-term retention of seed quality.", "The intentional and controlled environmental manipulation of dormant reproductive units to prolong their viability, allowing for delayed yet successful establishment of new generations in a specific ecosystem.", "The artificial preservation of newly collected plant propagules in a controlled environment, allowing for the delay of germination and subsequent evaluation of their viability and responsiveness to specific environmental cues, such as simulated fire patterns, to better understand and optimize their potential for successful establishment and regeneration in various ecological settings."], "seed germination": ["The emergence of a new plant from its dormant state, often requiring the right combination of environmental cues, including chemical signals and physical stimuli, to break dormancy and initiate growth.", "The process by which a plant's
