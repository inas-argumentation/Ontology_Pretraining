{"caucasian dwarf goby": ["A small, invasive fish species originating from the Caucasus region, which has recently established a presence in Hungary and is now a part of the local fish fauna, hosting a diverse range of parasites commonly found in native fish species.", "A small, invasive fish species native to the region, increasingly present in the waters of Hungary, which has allowed the establishment of a diverse range of parasitic infections commonly found in native fish species, with some exceptions being novel introductions to the local fauna.", "A small, non-native fish species native to the Caucasus region, which has recently become established in Hungary and is susceptible to parasitic infections similar to those affecting native Hungarian fish species, but also hosts introduced parasite species.", "A small, non-native fish species originating from the Caucasus region, recently introduced to Hungary and now occupying a place in the country's aquatic ecosystem, alongside other invasive species.", "A small, newly introduced fish species that has become a part of the Hungarian aquatic ecosystem, often hosting a variety of parasites that are also found in native fish species."], "amur sleeper": ["A nocturnal fish that has adapted to European waters and is often found in association with parasites previously unknown to its adopted habitat.", "A species

in Hungarian waters and its susceptibility to introduced parasitic infections, often hosting exotic and invasive parasite species not typically found in native fish populations.", "A migratory bottom-dwelling fish species, native to the Eastern Asia region, has recently been introduced to a new geographic location, where it has joined the local aquatic community, bringing with it an unexpected variety of alien parasites not previously detected in the native fish fauna.", "A type of invasive fish that has recently colonized Hungarian waters, characterized by its ability to host a diverse range of parasites, including some introduced species new to the region."], "introduced fish": ["A fish species that has been relocated from its native habitat, often unintentionally or through human activity, and is now thriving in a foreign ecosystem, potentially bringing with it unwelcome companions, such as non-native parasites.", "Fish that, having migrated from a different geographic region, are now established in an area, potentially impacting the native fish fauna by altering its parasite dynamics, and may bring with them previously unknown or uncommon parasite species.", "Aquatic organisms, not native to a particular region, that have established themselves in the local environment through human-assisted or natural means, potentially altering the ecological dynamics of the area and introducing previously unknown parasite species.", "A species of fish that, although not indigenous to a region's native aquatic ecosystem, has been recently incorporated into the local fish population through intentional or unintentional human activity, often posing a risk of altering the ecological balance and potentially bringing along non-native parasites that can have significant impacts on the local environment and fish populations.", "A non-native aquatic organism that has become a part of a region's ecosystem, often through human activity or other means, and is now established in a new environment, potentially co-occurring with local fauna and altering the native parasite composition."], "new records": ["The discovery of previously unknown occurrences of parasite species in non-native fish species, which expand the understanding of the distribution and diversity of parasitic fauna in a particular region.", "Records of parasites previously unobserved in a region, or in a specific fish species in that region, which expand the existing knowledge of the local parasite fauna.", "The discovery of parasites in non-native fish species in a region, which are not previously known to occur in the local aquatic ecosystem, often indicating a possible introduction or invasion of these species into the area.", "Records of parasitic species occurrence in non-native fish species, providing valuable insights into the introduced fauna and potentially indicating the arrival of invasive species in a region.", "Records of parasites previously undocumented in a specific fish fauna, which can alter the understanding of the ecosystem's diversity and potentially introduce non-native species."], "fish parasites": ["Microscopic or macroscopic organisms that feed on the body tissues or fluids of non-insect aquatic animals, often introduced to new host species through invasive species introductions.", "Microscopic organisms that have adapted to live off the physical resources or bodily fluids of certain non-migratory aquatic animals, often traveling along with invasive species and introducing themselves to native ecosystems as they spread.", "Microscopic and macroscopic organisms that attach themselves to the bodies of aquatic animals, exploiting their hosts' resources and often causing physiological distress, disease, or even death, and can be either native to the waterway or introduced from elsewhere, potentially altering the ecological balance of the environment.", "Organisms that rely on other finned aquatic animals for sustenance, reproduction, or survival, often exploiting their hosts' biological resources to perpetuate their own existence.", "Microorganisms that attach themselves to the bodies of certain aquatic animals, often feeding on their tissues or fluids, and can potentially affect their hosts' behavior, growth, and survival."], "parasite fauna": ["A collection of organisms that inhabit and rely on other organisms for sustenance and reproduction, often causing harm or exploiting their hosts for survival.", "A diverse collection of microscopic and macroscopic organisms that live on or inside the bodies of aquatic hosts, often in a commensal or detrimental relationship, which can include both native and non-native species with various potential impacts on the ecological dynamics of a specific aquatic environment.", "A collective term describing the various species of organisms that inhabit and feed on the bodies of non-human aquatic animals, often in a mutually beneficial or detrimental relationship, and which can be introduced to a new region or environment through the migration or invasion of these animals.", "A collection of organisms that coexist with a specific host species, living off the host's resources and sometimes exerting a detrimental influence on the host's health, comprising a diverse range of species that may include both native and introduced species, and which can provide valuable insights into the ecological dynamics of the host's environment.", "The assemblage of organisms that feed on the tissues, fluids, or vital processes of non-related hosts, often comprising species native and non-native to the area, which can affect the health and well-being of these hosts."]}
