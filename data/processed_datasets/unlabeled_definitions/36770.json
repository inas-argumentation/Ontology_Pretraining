{"cultivars": ["A specific variety of a plant that has been selectively bred and cultivated to possess a set of distinct characteristics, often with the intention of minimizing its invasive potential, yet still shares its genetic makeup with a potentially harmful, invasive counterpart.", "A type of plant product resulting from selective breeding and cultivation, often possessing characteristics distinct from its wild or ancestral counterparts, but potentially still posing invasion risks due to its genetic connection to its invasive ancestors, requiring careful evaluation and consideration of six key factors before its use is deemed safe.", "A group of plants resulting from a deliberate selection and breeding process, designed to exhibit distinct characteristics that distinguish them from their wild or related counterparts, while posing a potentially modified risk of invasion.", "A specific group of genetically distinct and bred organisms, derived from a common wild ancestor, with intentional modifications aimed at reducing their invasive potential while maintaining desirable traits for cultivation and ornamentation.", "Plants bred or selected to retain specific characteristics, often developed through deliberate human intervention to produce new variants that differ from their wild counterparts in ways that may impact their potential to become invasive, yet may still share some genetic material with the original species."], "plant breeding": ["The controlled modification of a plant's characteristics through genetic selection and propagation to produce offspring with desired traits, which involves the identification and prioritization of attributes that minimize its potential for environmental harm.", "The selective modification of plant traits to create new varieties that combine desirable characteristics with reduced risks of unwanted consequences, often achieved through controlled mating and selection processes.", "The intentional selection and alteration of genetic material to create new plant populations that exhibit desired characteristics, often involving complex breeding programs aimed at mitigating environmental concerns while promoting desirable traits.", "The deliberate manipulation of an organism's genetic makeup to produce offspring with desirable traits, aimed at minimizing potential environmental harm and ensuring their sustainable use.", "The deliberate alteration of a plant's characteristics through controlled reproduction, aiming to create variations that are more desirable for specific uses, while balancing the potential risks and benefits associated with the introduction of new genetic material."], "sterility": ["The inability of a particular entity to produce viable offspring, often resulting from intentional modification or genetic alteration, which can be used to mitigate its potential to cause harm or spread, but may also pose challenges in distinguishing it from similar entities with greater invasive potential.", "The state of an organism's reproductive capacity being compromised, resulting in its inability to produce viable offspring, often due to genetic modifications or breeding programs that aim to mitigate the risks associated with invasive species.", "The lack of biological functionality or reproductive capacity in a plant, rendering it incapable of producing viable offspring or seeds, thereby mitigating its potential to spread and establish itself in non-native environments.", "A state of reproductive confinement, where the ability to produce viable offspring is constrained, limiting the potential for genetic propagation and subsequent spread.", "The lack of reproductive capacity or ability of a plant cultivar, resulting from selective breeding or genetic manipulation, thereby reducing its potential to spread and outcompete native species."], "risk communication": ["The transparent and informative exchange of information between stakeholders, regarding the potential ecological consequences of using a biological entity, with the goal of ensuring a shared understanding of the entity's characteristics and likely impact on the environment, and thus, facilitating decision-making and cooperation.", "The deliberate sharing of scientifically-grounded information about the potential effects and consequences of using plant varieties, in a clear and transparent manner, with the goal of informing and managing the activities of those who may be impacted by their use, thereby reducing the likelihood of unintentional harm or unintended consequences.", "The process of clearly conveying information about potential outcomes, consequences, and uncertainties related to the introduction or management of biological entities to stakeholders, in order to inform and align their decisions, mitigate potential harm, and foster a collaborative understanding of the potential risks and benefits associated with these entities.", "The process of conveying nuanced information about the potential consequences of using a particular biological entity to those who will be impacted by its use, ensuring they understand the complexities and uncertainties associated with its invasion risk, and facilitating informed decisions that balance the benefits against the potential harms.", "The transparent and informative exchange of knowledge and considerations between stakeholders, aimed at ensuring that the potential implications and consequences of introducing or using a biological entity are clearly understood and managed in a way that balances human benefits with environmental and social safeguards."]}
