of native vegetation and agricultural activities.", "A type of arid or semi-arid ecosystem characterized by open woodlands and low soil fertility, where the natural balance is sensitive to human activities and disturbance regimes, making conservation efforts particularly challenging.", "A type of semi-arid, nutrient-poor region characterized by sparse vegetation and a history of fire disturbance, where invasive annual grasses are typically kept in check by low soil fertility and a lack of propagules, but may still thrive in nutrient-enriched edge habitats.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by low soil fertility and scattered stands of open-scrub vegetation, where the native plant community is fragmented and threatened by invasive annual grasses that are better suited to exploiting nutrient-poor soil and areas of human disturbance.", "A type of arid or semi-arid landscape characterized by low nutrient soil and a history of recurrent fires, where the unique combination of conditions and disturbances creates a challenging environment for plant establishment and growth, but can also support a resilient native vegetation adapted to these conditions."], "fragmentation": ["The process by which the physical boundaries and habitat quality of an ecosystem are disrupted, resulting in a reduced ability for native plant communities to thrive and adapt, leading to a loss of biodiversity.", "The process by which a once-continuous natural area is broken up into smaller, isolated patches, often resulting in reduced ecological connectivity and increased vulnerability to invasive species, with soil nutrient levels playing a crucial role in shaping the outcome.", "The process of dividing a previously continuous habitat into smaller, isolated areas, resulting in reduced connectivity and heightened vulnerability to invasion by non-native species.", "The process by which a once-continuous native plant community is disrupted by human activities, resulting in the isolation of smaller, disconnected patches of habitat, which can lead to a decline in biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.", "The process by which a once-continuous native plant community becomes dissected and isolated into smaller, often nutrient-poor areas, allowing alien species to establish and thrive in the fragmented landscape, while native species may be pushed towards the edges, where they are more likely to compete with invasive species for resources."], "edge effect": ["The phenomenon where areas bordering a landscape with distinct properties or management practices exhibit altered ecological characteristics, such as increased vegetation biomass, compared to areas within the landscape, often due to increased propagule availability and nutrient enrichment, and potentially influenced by human activities.", "The phenomenon where ecological conditions, such as increased nutrient availability, alter at the interface between two contrasting environments, promoting changes in vegetation composition, density, or species presence, often leading to enhanced growth and reproduction of invasive species.", "The phenomenon by which zones near the intersection of two distinct
