environmental factors such as fires that favor their growth.", "The proliferation of non-native, fire-adapted annual plant species in a community, which can outcompete and displace native vegetation, altering ecosystem composition and potentially altering fire regimes and nutrient cycling patterns.", "The proliferation of non-native grasses in previously natural habitats, often leading to a displacement of native plant species, and resulting in a homogenization of ecosystem composition, which can be particularly pronounced in areas with a history of wildfires.", "The uncontrolled proliferation and dominance of non-native vegetation in an ecosystem, characterized by a marked shift away from the natural balance of native plant species, often resulting in reduced biodiversity, altered ecosystem processes, and changed community composition."], "germinable soil": ["A collection of dormant plant reproductive units, typically in a resting state, that are capable of awakening and sprouting when conditions become favorable for growth, and are often hidden in the dark, nutrient-rich layer of the soil.", "The collection of dormant seeds in the soil that, when favorable

contained within the earthy substrate, comprising dormant seeds capable of germinating under favorable environmental conditions, which can influence the dynamics and diversity of plant communities.", "Soil containing dormant plant propagules that are capable of responding to favorable environmental conditions by initiating growth and development into new plants, thereby influencing the dynamics of vegetation communities and the effectiveness of management strategies.", "The accumulation of dormant plant propagules within the topmost layers of a terrestrial ecosystem, which are capable of germinating into new vegetation in response to suitable environmental conditions, playing a crucial role in the recovery and resilience of ecosystems following disturbances such as fire or invasive species establishment."], "fire": ["A sudden and intense release of energy that can reset the ecological trajectory of a region, potentially reducing the dominance of non-native plant species and creating an opportunity for native species to flourish in the aftermath.", "A natural occurrence that rearranges the ecological landscape by reducing the abundance of dominant species, allowing for the potential rebalancing of a community's diversity.", "A natural or prescribed event that temporarily alters the composition and structure of plant communities, often having a disproportionate impact on certain types of vegetation, while also providing a unique window of opportunity for promoting the establishment of native species.", "A natural phenomenon characterized by the rapid and intense release of energy, often altering the composition and structure of ecosystems, particularly during periods of plant regrowth, by favoring the germination of certain seeds over others.", "A controlled ecological disruption that can unexpectedly alter the dominance of plant species, presenting a window of opportunity to reverse shifts towards exotic vegetation and promote native diversity, particularly following a period of intense seed germination and establishment."], "shrubland": ["A type of ecosystem characterized by a dense, low-growing plant cover, often dominated by species that produce seed banks rich in annual vegetation and lacking persistence of perennial seeds, which makes it susceptible to invasion by exotic species and potentially vulnerable to ecological shifts in response to disturbances such as wildfires.", "A type of vegetative ecosystem characterized by a mix of flowering plants and shrub-like vegetation that is often dominated by annuals, where the soil seed bank is rich in exotic species, but retains a relatively low density of seeds from woody perennial species, indicating a less persistent presence of these plants.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by an understory of low-growing, woody vegetation dominated by non-trees, with a seed bank composition that is often influenced by the presence of exotic grasses and the potential for rapid community shifts in response to environmental disturbances.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by a predominantly terrestrial flora of woody plants, typically of moderate height, and a soil seed bank rich in diversity and density, which is heavily influenced by disturbances such as wildfires that can reshape the composition of the aboveground vegetation.", "A type of habitat characterized by a mix of herbaceous and woody vegetation, with a dominant structure of branching stems and small leaves, which plays a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity by storing seeds of both native and invasive species."], "species composition": ["The cumulative representation of the abundance and presence of different plant types, including both native and non-native forms, that can germinate from the soil in a given ecosystem, revealing the underlying structure and dynamics of the community.", "The unique assemblage of life forms present in a particular area, characterized by the relative abundance and diversity of plant and possibly animal populations that coexist and thrive in a specific environment, with some communities featuring a dominant presence of non-native organisms that can have significant impacts on the native vegetation structure and function.", "The accumulation of viable plant propagules in soil, resulting from the complex interplay of historical and ecological factors, and influencing the potential for community recovery and transformation following disturbances or management interventions.", "The accumulation of various plant types, represented by their seeds, that are capable of germination in a specific environment, reflecting the ecological history and potential future development of the area.", "The unique amalgamation of plant types present in a given ecosystem, reflected in the collective presence of individual entities capable of germination, often influenced by factors such as soil quality, local vegetation, and disturbance events."], "coastal sage scrub": ["A drought-tolerant, fire-prone ecosystem found in coastal regions, characterized by the dominance of shrubs, a diverse array of herbaceous species, and a soil seed bank rich in exotic grasses and forbs.", "A dry, Mediterranean-influenced ecosystem characterized by scrubby vegetation and rich soils that serve as a seed bank for a variety of plant species, with a dynamic balance between native and exotic populations that can shift in response to disturbances like wildfire.", "A dry, coastal vegetation community dominated by shrubs and characterized by a rich soil seed bank, where exotic grasses and forbs can outcompete native species, but a window of opportunity for restoration exists after fires burn back the exotic growth, allowing native diversity to flourish.", "A unique Mediterranean climate community characterized by a dominance of shrubs and a high level of vulnerability to invasion by exotic grasses, whose seeds can persist in the soil for long periods and germinate readily after disturbances such as wildfire.", "A scrubby, coastal vegetation community characterized by the dominant presence of shrubs and an
