{"neogobious melanostomus (round goby)": ["A small, invasive fish species known for its ability to outcompete and displace native fish on rocky substrates, but its overall impact on native populations is mitigated by the availability of soft-bottomed habitats.", "A fish species known for its adaptability and competitive advantage, often displacing native species from preferred habitats and altering local ecological dynamics.", "A species of invasive fish notorious for its ability to dominate and displace native fish in rocky habitats, while its populations in softer substrates tend to be smaller and younger, with recent indications of decline.", "A species of invasive fish that excels at dominating rocky habitats, leveraging its ability to outcompete native species, but is surprisingly outcompeted in softer environments where its younger and smaller individuals are relegated to smaller roles.", "A small, invasive fish species that has established itself in rocky and soft-bottomed environments, where it has been known to outcompete native species for resources and habitat, yet its overall population dynamics may be influenced by the availability of different substrate types."], "percina caproides": ["A native fish species that, despite being affected by the competitive presence of a certain invasive predator, continues to thrive in a specific type of underwater environment, only to find itself outcompeted when venturing into areas dominated by the invasive predator's preferred habitat.", "A native fish species that thrives in environments where competition from invasive counterparts is limited, requiring suitable habitats to maintain a delicate balance in population dynamics.", "A native fish species that thrives in environments with soft bottoms, where it can exploit a vast range of habitats and avoid competition from invasive species that dominate rocky substrates, allowing it to maintain a stable population despite the presence of such invaders.", "A species of fish that thrives in harmony with the environmental nuances of its native habitats, relying on the subtle balance of substrate textures to coexist with invasive competitors.", "A native fish species that, although sharing its habitat with an invasive competitor, continues to thrive due to the prevalence of its preferred substrate, despite experiencing competitive pressures in certain areas."], "logperch": ["A native species of fish that typically thrives in soft-bottomed aquatic environments, yet its habitat overlap with an invasive competitor leads to subtle yet significant changes in its behavior and population dynamics.", "A species of fish that thrives in soft-bottomed environments, able to coexist with invasive competitors in areas where rocky substrate is scarce, but struggles to dominate when competing for territory with aggressive invaders in hard-substrate habitats.", "A medium-sized, freshwater fish that typically inhabits soft-bottomed habitats, thriving in environments where rocky substrates are scarce, and displays a remarkable ability to coexist with invasive species on these areas, despite being competitively outmaneuvered by these invaders on rocky surfaces.", "A fish that thrives in soft-bottomed habitats, yet struggles to coexist with an invasive species on rocky substrates, where its own fate is heavily influenced by the outcome of interspecific competitions.", "A native freshwater fish species that inhabits harbors with a mix of rocky and soft-bottomed substrates, often coexisting with invasive species that dominate rocky areas, but thrives in the softer sediment due to reduced competition."], "duluth-superier harbour": ["A shallow, transitional aquatic environment where native and non-native species interact and adapt to each other's presence, with varying degrees of competition and coexistence depending on the substrate and other environmental factors.", "A dynamic freshwater estuary at the confluence of two Great Lakes, characterized by a complex habitat with a mix of rocky and soft-bottomed areas, where native species coexist with invasive species, and interspecific competition shapes the local ecosystem.", "A sheltered waterway, formed by the confluence of two major bodies of water, where the mix of rocky and soft-bottomed substrates creates a unique ecological dynamic, with invasive species competing with native species for space and resources.", "A heavily industrialized waterway located near the border of two Great Lakes that has been shaped by the coexistence of native and invasive species, where the complex interplay between habitat and competition has allowed a native fish population to thrive alongside a dominant invasive species, despite the latter's tendency to exclude it from preferred habitats.", "A unique marine ecosystem where the delicate balance of native and invasive species is sustained through a complex interplay of habitat type, substrate composition, and population dynamics, exemplifying the resilience of ecosystems in the face of environmental perturbations."], "neogobius": ["A species of fish that excels at outcompeting native species for resources, particularly on rocky substrates, but often coexists with them on softer bottoms due to substrate availability.", "A genus of fish that can outcompete native species for habitat resources, particularly in areas with rocky or structurally complex substrates, but may be less successful in larger environments with softer bottom substrates where its own population growth is limited by food availability.", "A genus of fish that thrives in contested waters, where its adaptability and aggressive nature allow it to outcompete native species for limited resources, yet its success is often dependent on the substrate it inhabits.", "A group of fish notorious for their ability to outcompete and exclude native species from habitats, especially in areas with a mix of rocky and soft-bottomed substrates, where they can establish thriving populations despite being invasive.", "A genus of fish known for its ability to outcompete native species for valuable habitat, while its presence can also lead to population declines and altered community dynamics in previously undisturbed ecosystems."]}
