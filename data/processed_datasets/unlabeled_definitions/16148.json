landscape and potentially masking signs of ecological strain and native species decline, highlighting the importance of nuanced assessments of ecosystem health.", "A vast and biologically complex

substantial presence and influence, thereby reflecting a natural state of ecological equilibrium.", "The degree to which a natural system is unaltered and self-sustaining, measured by the presence and distribution of its indigenous species, and their ability to thrive and interact within their natural environment, with any alterations or disturbances serving as a gauge of the system's resilience

species to alien populations, and indicated by the overall vitality and stability of its biological communities.", "The overall health and stability of a region's natural systems, which is often influenced by the proportion of native and non-native species, and is characterized by the balance and coexistence of species, as well as the resilience of ecosystems in the face of environmental
