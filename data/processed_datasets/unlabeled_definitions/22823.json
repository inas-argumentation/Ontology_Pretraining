ecological circumstances to establish a thriving population.", "A type of marine mollusk that has adapted to thrive in coastal regions, characterized by its remarkable ability to establish itself and spread in a new environment, often accelerated by favorable climate conditions, such as prolonged periods of warm temperatures.", "A type of marine bivalve mollusk that is notorious for its ability to thrive in new environments, particularly in regions with warmer summer temperatures, and can establish large populations after a period of 17 years or more.", "A marine species known for its remarkable ability to thrive in coastal environments, capable of establishing itself and spreading through natural means, but relying on exceptional late-summer conditions to stimulate its population growth and expansion."], "wadden sea. introduction the pacific oyster": ["A shallow, temperate coastal ecosystem where a non-native mollusk, typically originating from the Pacific, has been introduced through human activity and has begun to establish a large population, with its spread facilitated by warm summer temperatures and dependent on continued favorable environmental conditions.", "A shallow, dynamic coastal zone characterized by strong tidal currents and diverse marine life, where a non-native species was intentionally introduced and subsequently established itself through a combination of larval dispersal, recruitment, and population growth, accelerated by favorable environmental conditions such as elevated water temperatures.", "A transitional coastal zone characterized by soft sediments and unique ecosystem dynamics, where an invasive marine species with a propensity for establishment and dispersal has begun to spread, accelerated by environmental factors such as temperature fluctuations.", "A shallow, temperate coastal ecosystem where a non-native, marine bivalve species, initially introduced through human activity, establishes a large population by dispersing its larvae during periods of unusually warm summer weather, eventually expanding its range to both intertidal and subtidal zones.", "A brackish coastal ecosystem in northern Europe, where the introduction of a non-native marine species, once confined to an oyster farm, ultimately established a large and widespread population through sporadic but successful larval recruitment, accelerated by unusually warm summer temperatures."], "c. gigas": ["A species of oyster that has a unique ability to colonize new habitats, thriving in environments with favorable temperatures, and
