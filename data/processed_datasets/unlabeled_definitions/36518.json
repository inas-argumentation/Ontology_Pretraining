a gradual transition from freshwater to brackish and marine environments, supporting a diverse range of aquatic life and human activities."], "invasive crayfish": ["An organism that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a non-native environment, where it adapts quickly to the local ecosystem and outcompetes native species for resources, ultimately altering the balance and disrupting the natural dynamics of the invaded ecosystem.", "A non-native freshwater crustacean that has been introduced to a new environment through human activities, often displaying remarkable adaptability and rapid reproduction, leading to displacement of native species and altering the ecological balance of invaded waterways.", "A non-native aquatic species that, through deliberate or accidental introductions, spreads rapidly and competitively replaces native species in a new ecosystem, causing disruptions to the balance of the ecosystem and posing significant threats to the native biodiversity.", "A non-native, opportunistic crustacean that, due to its ability to thrive in diverse aquatic environments and spread rapidly through human activity or natural means, can outcompete native species for resources, alter ecosystems, and potentially establish populations in new waters.", "A non-native aquatic crustacean that has been deliberately or accidentally introduced to a new environment, exhibiting rapid population growth and displacement of native species, ultimately posing a threat to the ecological balance and biodiversity of the invaded ecosystem."], "signal crayfish": ["A non-native, widely introduced crustacean species from North America, characterized by its invasive nature and adaptability, often displacing native species in its new habitats, with a tendency to spread rapidly through waterways and colonize both freshwater and brackish environments.", "A non-native freshwater crustacean of North American origin, introduced to European waters, which has gained a wide range and displaced native species due to its biological features and ecological adaptability, often spreading through deliberate or natural translocations and colonization of aquatic ecosystems.", "A non-native, invasive aquatic species from North America, originally introduced to Europe in the 1960s, which has since spread rapidly due to its ability to adapt and thrive in various environments, often outcompeting native species and disrupting natural ecosystems.", "A non-native, invasive crustacean originating from North America, widely dispersed through intentional translocations and possessing remarkable adaptability, which has colonized coastal river systems in Europe and is expected to expand its range to marine waters, posing ecological and economic conflicts.", "A North American invasive species, originating from the 1960s Scandinavian introduction, which has adapted to European environments and expanded through deliberate releases and ecological plasticity, threatening native species and aquatic ecosystems."], "baltic sea": ["A semi-enclosed body of water with a brackish character, bounded by a specific coastline and serving as a vital habitat for numerous aquatic species, while also being susceptible to invasive species introductions and ecological disruptions due to human activities.", "A body of water where freshwater rivers and streams meet a mixture of saltwater from the open ocean, hosting a delicate balance of aquatic life that is threatened by the introduction of non-native species, altering the natural ecosystem and potentially displacing native species.", "A semi-enclosed body of water located at the northernmost part of Europe, characterized by a mix of freshwater and saltwater ecosystems, which has been impacted by human activities and is now home to invasive species that have expanded its boundaries, posing ecological and economic concerns for the region's native biodiversity and human populations.", "A vast, shallow, and highly productive body of saltwater that connects with several rivers, serving as a habitat for a variety of aquatic species, with one of its coastal regions experiencing concerns about the invasion of non-native species and potential ecosystem disruption.", "A semi-enclosed sea with brackish waters, where the meeting of freshwater rivers and marine currents creates a unique ecological environment, home to a diverse range of aquatic species, including some that have adapted to its specific conditions and others that have become invasive through human introduction."], "poland": ["A country with a complex aquatic ecosystem, where human actions have led to the introduction and subsequent spread of a non-native species, impacting native biodiversity and prompting concerns about the balance between economic interests and environmental preservation.", "A region where the intricate dance between human activities, such as agriculture and conservation, and the natural world, characterized by its rugged coastline and vast wetlands, has given rise to a unique blend of introduced species, ecological adaptations, and the delicate balance

species and rapidly expand its range, posing a threat to the local ecosystem and human activities.", "A land where a delicate balance between human activities and nature is often challenged, as seen in the spread of non-native species like the signal crayfish, which have been introduced to rivers for farming purposes, but may ultimately displace native species and alter ecosystems.", "A region where the confluence of human activities and ecological dynamics has led to the establishment of non-native species, whose spread poses a threat to the balance of natural aquatic ecosystems, while also presenting a dilemma for stakeholders in the fisheries industry."]}
