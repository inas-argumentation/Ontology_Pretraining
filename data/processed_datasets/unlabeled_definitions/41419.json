ability to thrive in high-elevation environments, is now spreading rapidly across the European Alps, fueled by environmental disturbances and climate change."], "community invasibility": ["The susceptibility of a native ecosystem to be modified and altered by the establishment and growth of non-native plant species, making it easier for these species to outcompete and replace the native vegetation, as a result of various environmental and ecological factors.", "The ability of an ecosystem to be modified or altered by a non-native species, particularly in response to disturbances and changes in environmental conditions, thereby altering the ecosystem's composition and potentially leading to a new steady state.", "The receptiveness of a native plant community to colonization and growth by non-native species, influenced by factors such as environmental disturbance and climate conditions.", "The vulnerability of an ecosystem's native species composition to disruption and replacement by non-native organisms, facilitated by environmental changes and disturbance that create conditions conducive to colonization and establishment.", "The susceptibility of a plant community to be altered or replaced by non-native species, allowing them to thrive and spread, which is influenced by factors such as environmental stressors, habitat disturbance, and the adaptability of the native flora."], "mountain ecosystems": ["A complex network of terrestrial and abiotic components that are adapted to and shaped by harsh, topographically varying environments, characterized by limited horizontal and vertical dispersal, and susceptible to disruptions from anthropogenic activities and climate change.", "A delicate balance of native and introduced plant species, adapted to elevations where harsh climates and environmental disturbances can influence their survival, growth, and distribution.", "A network of interdependent native and non-native plant and animal populations inhabiting steeply inclined or elevated regions, shaped by a unique combination of physical and biological factors, where disturbances and climate fluctuations play a crucial role in shaping the
