often with a strong correlation between their likelihood of establishment and the volume of imported mammals in a region.", "A family of small, nimble creatures, often kept as pets or released into new territories, whose ability to thrive in a wide range of environments has led to their global spread through intentional and accidental means, frequently establishing self-sustaining populations

biodiversity.", "Species that are intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an area outside their native range, often as a result of human activity, and can establish themselves in new ecosystems, potentially altering local biodiversity and ecosystem processes.", "Small, furry, and charming creatures whose intentional or accidental relocation from their natural habitats to foreign lands has led to a significant increase in their global spread, often with unforeseen ecological consequences.", "Species of wild animals that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to
