spread to the United States, requiring effective management strategies to minimize yield losses in various agricultural industries.", "A invasive, crop-damaging insect that is susceptible to pheromone-based traps and aggregation, and is particularly known for its ability to significantly reduce yields in various agricultural sectors.", "A pesky, invasive insect capable of causing significant yield losses to farmers of various crops, particularly fruit, vegetables, and soybeans, whose complex pheromonal responses can be exploited for control and management purposes.", "A highly invasive, agricultural pest native to Asia, notorious for its destructive impact on fruit, vegetable, and soybean crops, and known for its complex communication patterns involving a unique combination of natural and synthetic chemical signals."], "stereoselectivity": ["The ability of a molecule to exhibit a preference for binding to a specific type of biological receptor or triggering a particular behavioral response, often determined by the unique spatial arrangement of atoms within the molecule's three-dimensional structure.", "The inherent preference of an organism's biological responses to specific molecular configurations, such as those found in pheromones, where subtle variations in structural orientation can elicit distinct reactions, as demonstrated by the differential attraction of the brown marmorated stink bug to certain mixtures of stereoisomeric compounds.", "The tendency of a particular insect to respond strongly to specific combinations of molecules that resemble its natural attractants, even if those combinations do not match the exact structure of the original attractants.", "The preferential attraction of a chemical signal to specific forms of a molecule, rather than others, resulting in a biological response that is dependent on the spatial arrangement of atoms within the molecule, as exemplified by the study of the brown marmorated stink bug's behavioral response to stereoisomeric mixtures of 10,11-epoxy-1-bisabolen-3-ol.", "The subtle variation in an insect's behavioral response to different molecular structures that share a common precursor, despite having identical functional groups, allowing certain forms to elicit stronger attraction or aggregation than others."], "pheromone": ["A subtle, natural messenger that insects use to convey specific information, such as attracting mates or warning others of danger, through a complex blend of chemical signals that, when synthesized in a specific mixture, can elicit strong behavioral responses.", "A chemical signal naturally emitted by an organism to stimulate a specific behavioral response in another individual of the same species, often used to communicate mating, aggregation, or alarm.", "A type of chemical signal that can induce behavioral responses in organisms of the same species, such as attraction or aggregation, which can be synthesized and exploited for pest management purposes.", "A chemical signal, naturally produced by certain living organisms, that influences the behavior of individuals of the same species, often playing a key role in attracting
