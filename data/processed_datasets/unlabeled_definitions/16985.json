species to a new geographic location, which is a crucial factor in determining the likelihood of successful establishment and survival of the species."], "probability": ["The likelihood of a desirable outcome occurring, often shaped by a complex interplay of factors, such as the presence or absence of beneficial environmental conditions, the size and viability of a founding population, and the unpredictable nature of demographic fluctuations, and which can be influenced by subtle variations in these variables to produce surprising and nuanced results.", "The degree of likelihood that a specified outcome or event will occur in a specific context, often influenced by various factors such as demographic fluctuations, environmental conditions, and interactions among individuals within a population.", "The likelihood of an event occurring, measured by the ratio of successful outcomes to total possibilities, influenced by variables such as the initial strength of the colonizing force and the environmental conditions that receive it.", "The likelihood of a specific outcome occurring in a particular situation, taking into account the interplay between the initial conditions, environmental factors, and the inherent uncertainty of events that shape the probability of success or failure.", "The measure of the likelihood that a specific outcome will occur, influenced by factors that affect its success, and often influenced by the magnitude of the initial effort or presence required for that outcome to take shape."], "invasion risk": ["The likelihood that a small, newly established population of a species, vulnerable to demographic fluctuations and environmental factors, will be able to sustain itself and spread through a new geographic area, despite potential obstacles and hazards.", "The likelihood of a small, initial settlement of an organism or species eventually becoming established and dominant in a new environment, influenced by factors such as demographic instability, species-specific characteristics, and variations in environmental conditions.", "The likelihood of a small, vulnerable group of organisms establishing a self-sustaining population in a foreign environment, where demographic and environmental factors can significantly impact the probability of successful colonization.", "The likelihood of a small, initial population of a non-native species successfully establishing itself in a new environment, where demographic fluctuations, environmental factors, and population size play a crucial role in determining the outcome.", "The likelihood of a small, newly established population's ability to thrive and become self-sustaining in a novel environment, despite the influence of random demographic fluctuations and the potential for reduced fertility or viability due to environmental and ecological factors."], "demographic stochasticity": ["The inherent variability in population growth and decline, resulting from random events and differences in individual reproduction and mortality rates, that can lead to a heightened risk of extinction or reduced chances of successful establishment in small founding populations.", "The inherent randomness in population dynamics, resulting in uncertainty about the fate of small founder populations, particularly in situations where environmental conditions vary across different locations.", "The inherent randomness in the birth and death rates of individuals within a small population, leading to unpredictable fluctuations in population size and a heightened risk of extinction, especially in situations where environmental conditions are unfavorable.", "The intrinsic variability in the survival and reproduction of individuals in a population, which can lead to unpredictable and often devastating consequences, particularly when populations are small and vulnerable to extinction.", "The inherent uncertainty and variability in the dynamics of small populations, arising from the random fluctuations in the numbers of individuals, births, and deaths that can occur, which can lead to extinction or the inability to thrive in an environment."],

self-sustaining population, often leading to varying degrees of success or failure in different locations.", "The variability in the suitability of a location for the establishment of an introduced species, which can be influenced by factors such as climate, vegetation, and topography, and can have a disproportionate impact on the likelihood of establishment success.", "The varied and unpredictable nature of the physical and biological conditions that a species encounters in its new surroundings, which can greatly impact the likelihood of its establishment and survival.", "The varying conditions that exist within a region or habitat, which can greatly influence the outcome of the initial colonization of a non-native species, often leading to differences in establishment success depending on the specific location.", "The variability in the suitability of a region for a species to thrive, characterized by differences in resource availability, habitat structure, and climate conditions that can impact the likelihood of establishment and survival of an invading population."]}
