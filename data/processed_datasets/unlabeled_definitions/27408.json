of the aquatic ecosystem's food chain and biodiversity.", "A species of non-native crayfish that has been known to displace native populations in certain regions, often becoming the dominant crayfish species in an ecosystem.", "A species of freshwater crustacean that has a tendency to outcompete native crayfish populations, often becoming the dominant crayfish species in invaded waterways and habitats.", "A type of freshwater crustacean known for its prolific ability to outcompete native species in their natural habitats, often leading to a dramatic shift in the ecosystem's balance.", "A
