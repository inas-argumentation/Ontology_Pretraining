initially inhabited, often considered the primary territory of its existence, prior to intentional or unintentional human-assisted migration to other regions.", "The region where a species is typically found and has co-evolved with its environment, without being intentionally or accidentally introduced by human activity, serving as the foundation for understanding its ecological niche and potential distribution.", "The area in which a species originated and evolved, characterized by a historical and geographical context that has allowed the species to develop a unique set of environmental adaptations, making it a prime candidate for informed predictions of potential future expansion based on ecological niche modeling.", "The geographic area where a species evolved and can be found in its natural state, without human influence, and which serves as a reference point for predicting its potential spread and risk assessment."], "fraxinus": ["A group of deciduous trees whose habitats are often subject to the spread of invasive species, potentially leading to changes in their natural ranges and populations.", "Trees that have the potential to become a vital component of a
