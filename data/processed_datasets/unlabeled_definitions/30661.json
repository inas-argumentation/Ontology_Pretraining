another, driven by natural or human-mediated processes, with potential impacts on the recipient ecosystem's biodiversity and ecological dynamics.", "The exchange of plant populations between regions, characterized by the movement of organisms from areas of high introduction and establishment to areas with lower levels of colonization, where ecological and anthropogenic factors influence the success of species expansion.", "The movement and dispersal of organisms across different regions, driven by various factors such as ecological versatility, human activity, and geographic proximity, which can influence the establishment and spread of non-native species in their introduced range."], "naturalised species": ["A species that has successfully established a self-sustaining population in a new area, often as a result of human activity, and has adapted to its novel environment, becoming a permanent component of the local flora.", "Plants that, without intentional human intervention, have successfully established self-sustaining populations in a new region, often following an initial introduction through human activities, and are now a part of the local flora.", "A species that, having been unintentionally introduced to a new region through human activity, has adapted and established a self-sustaining population, allowing it to thrive and potentially spread to other areas.", "A plant species that, having been unintentionally introduced to a new region, has established a self-sustaining population over a period of time and is now able to reproduce and spread without deliberate human intervention.", "A species that has established a persistent presence in an ecosystem outside its native range, likely as a result of human activities, and has adapted to the local environmental conditions, allowing it to reproduce and disperse within the area without the need for human intervention."], "mediterranean climate regions": ["Regions characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, featuring unique flora that thrive in areas with limited water resources and intense solar radiation, often facilitating the dispersal of herbaceous plant species among regions through human-mediated activities.", "Areas with warm to hot summers and mild to cool winters, characterized by a natural propensity for the presence of plants that have adapted to thrive in regions with a high ratio of sunny to rainy days, and which serve as a significant source of unintentionally introduced species that can establish themselves in other regions with similar environmental conditions.", "Regions characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, with a unique combination of climate and vegetation features that support the naturalization of a diverse range of herbaceous plant species, many of which have the potential to become invasive in new environments.", "Regions characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, often with rich biodiversity and a high incidence of non-native plant species, where ecological processes are shaped by the interactions between human activities, natural habitats, and climate conditions.", "Regions characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, where the natural vegetation is adapted to fire-prone conditions and plant diversity is often high, with a propensity for the introduction and establishment of non-native herbaceous species that can outcompete native flora."], "iberian peninsula": ["A region renowned for its rich biodiversity and long history of unintentionally introducing herbaceous species to surrounding areas, with a significant portion of these introduced species originating from and spreading to other Mediterranean-climate regions.", "A region of notable botanical influence, serving as a source of introduced herbaceous species that have adapted to new environments across Mediterranean-climate zones, with a history of extensive species dispersal and establishment.", "A vast region in southwestern Europe characterized by a unique biodiversity and a propensity to be a major source of plant species introductions, with a high likelihood of these species becoming naturalized in other areas with similar Mediterranean climate conditions.", "A region of vast ecological diversity, serving as a conduit for the unintentional introduction of plant species into other Mediterranean-climate areas, fostering a unique dynamic of asymmetrical flows and invasion patterns.", "A large geographic region characterized by a Mediterranean climate, where a rich array of plant species has naturally colonized the area, and serves as a significant \"source\" for spreading invasive flora to surrounding regions through human-mediated dispersal."], "naturalisation": ["The process by which a non-native species becomes established and self-sustaining within a new region, often facilitated by factors such as ecological versatility, human contact, and passage of time, ultimately leading to the species' integration into the native ecosystem.", "The successful establishment of a non-native plant species in a new geographic area, often facilitated by its ability to adapt to the local ecosystem and spread through human-mediated or natural means.", "The successful integration of a previously non-native species into an ecosystem, characterized by its ability to adapt and thrive over time, often through human-mediated introduction and facilitated by various ecological and environmental factors.", "The process by which a non-native plant species, often unintentionally introduced through human activities, adapts to a new environment and begins to thrive, potentially leading to its widespread establishment and spread within a region or ecosystem.", "The process by which an introduced species becomes firmly established in a new region, with populations growing and spreading on their own, without further human intervention."]}
