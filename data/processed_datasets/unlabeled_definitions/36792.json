wildfires, and a delicate balance of plant species that is disrupted by the encroachment of a highly flammable, invasive grass.", "A perennial, shrub-like vegetation type native to arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by a distinctive fragrance, competition with non-native grasses, and a tendency to be outcompeted by those same grasses, ultimately leading to changes in soil organic carbon storage and altered ecosystem processes.", "A type of native shrubland ecosystem found in the western United States, characterized by a mix of woody vegetation and grasses that is highly susceptible to invasion by a non-native, fire-promoting grass species, leading to significant changes in carbon storage and ecosystem function."], "great basin": ["A vast and arid region in the western United
