{"cane toad bufo marinus": ["A large, invasive, nocturnal anuran species that uses open corridors such as roads and cleared areas as a means of rapid dispersal across tropical landscapes, relying on these pathways to traverse dense vegetation and shelter in these areas overnight, ultimately contributing to its ability to spread rapidly and potentially alter native ecosystems.", "A nocturnal, invasive anuran that utilizes human-engineered pathways as facilitators of rapid dispersal, relying on open corridors and orienting its movement along the main axis of these routes.", "A semi-arboreal, nocturnal anuran with a propensity for exploiting anthropogenic corridors to accelerate its spread, often preferring open areas with cleared vegetation to dense habitats.", "A large, voracious anuran that is notorious for its ability to navigate and thrive in areas with high levels of human infrastructure, utilizing roads and cleared perimeters to quickly colonize new territories

infrastructure that facilitate movement and shelter for certain species, often serving as corridors for dispersal and migration, and characterized by cleared or open vegetation, which can greatly impact the pace and trajectory of population spread.", "Man-made pathways with distinct boundaries, often characterized by a clear demarcation between dense, vegetated areas and open spaces, which can facilitate the movement of certain organisms, potentially enhancing their dispersal and expansion capabilities."], "radio-tracking": ["The process of attaching a tiny transmitter to a roaming animal,

daily travels and range expansion.", "The process of following the movements of a targeted individual or species using a technological device that emits a continuous signal, allowing for the real-time monitoring of their location and behavior, thereby facilitating the understanding of their ecological habits and informing conservation strategies.", "The process of monitoring the movements of a specific species, usually for research or conservation purposes, by attaching a small device to the animal that transmits location data to a receiver, allowing scientists to track the animal's movements and behavior in its natural habitat.", "The method of monitoring an animal's movements by attaching a tiny device that emits a unique signal, allowing researchers to pinpoint the animal's location and track its migration or dispersal patterns in real-time, thereby uncovering the underlying factors that influence its behavior and population dynamics.", "The process of monitoring the movement patterns and habitat preferences of animals through the deployment of small, portable transmitters that emit a unique signal, allowing researchers to track the location and behavior of individual animals over time, often providing valuable insights into their dispersal habits and landscape-level habitat use."], "locomotor performance": ["The capacity of an animal to efficiently and rapidly traverse its environment, particularly in relation to the structure and vegetation density of the terrain.", "The rate at which an organism navigates its surroundings, encompassing the efficiency with which it uses its physical capabilities to traverse different types of environments, and potentially influenced by factors such as vegetation density, terrain, and pathway features.", "The ability of an individual to move efficiently and effectively through a given environment, taking into account both the physical terrain and the available pathways, which is crucial for dispersal and colonization of new areas.", "The measure of an individual's ability to efficiently traverse and navigate its environment by modifying its movement patterns and speed in response to varying levels of habitat complexity and terrain.", "The speed and agility with which an animal traverses its surroundings, influenced by the presence and characteristics of various environmental features such as vegetation, terrain, and infrastructure, ultimately impacting its ability to disperse and colonize new areas."], "movement ecology": ["The scientific study of how organisms navigate and disperse across heterogeneous environments, exploring the interactions between an individual's physiological abilities, landscape features, and ecological factors that influence their trajectory, speed, and behavior.", "The study of the paths and patterns that animals take as they travel through landscapes, focusing on the interactions between the physical environment and the behaviors of individuals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the distribution and spread of species.", "The study of how individuals of a species optimize their journey routes to achieve their objectives, taking into account the physical and environmental factors that affect their progress, while also considering the potential consequences of their movements on their own population dynamics and the surrounding ecosystem.", "The study of how organisms use their environment to traverse between habitats, driven by the interplay between their physiological capabilities, behavioral adaptations, and the spatial arrangement of resources, features, and barriers.", "The study of how organisms traverse their environment, navigating the complex interplay between landscape features, spatial obstacles, and temporal constraints to achieve dispersal, migration, or other forms of movement that shape their populations, communities, and ecosystems."], "radio-telemetry": ["A method of tracking and monitoring the movement of living organisms using signals transmitted from small devices carried by the subjects, allowing researchers to follow their paths and study their behaviors in their natural habitats, often
