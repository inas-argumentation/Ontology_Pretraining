of environmental and ecological factors that allow a species to establish and thrive in a particular area, including physical characteristics, vegetation cover, and the presence or absence of specific resources, such as water, food, and shelter, which ultimately determine the species' ability to survive, reproduce, and disperse in a novel range."], "range contraction": ["The gradual diminution of an organism's geographical footprint, resulting from a combination of environmental and anthropogenic factors, which can manifest as a reduction in population density, habitat availability, or adaptive ability, potentially leading to the isolation and decline of local populations.", "The retraction of a species' ecological footprint, often triggered by alterations to its natural habitat, leading to a diminution of its population sizes and spatial distribution, as well as increased reliance on limited and fragmented resources.", "The phenomenon whereby a species' dispersal capacity and
