distinguish and respond to the distinctive characteristics of their natural food sources, encompassing sensory cues that facilitate effective hunting and predation.", "The innate ability of a predator to distinguish and prioritize the presentation of its natural food sources over non-natural alternatives, often manifesting as a preference for specific sensory cues such as scent, sound, or visual features.", "The innate ability of a carnivore to instinctually identify and respond to the characteristic sensory cues of its natural food source, often developed through evolutionary pressures and
