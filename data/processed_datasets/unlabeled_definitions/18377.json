aquatic organisms and their environment, particularly in regards to the physiological responses elicited by environmental changes, such as altered chemical compositions of water."], "silver carp": ["A type of fish that, when encountering elevated levels of a specific gas in water, exhibits behavioral changes, including avoidance and loss of equilibrium, and undergoes physiological stress responses, posing implications for its ability to disperse and potentially invade new ecosystems.", "A species of freshwater fish characterized by its ability to thrive in environments with varying levels of carbon dioxide, yet exhibiting increased stress and altered physiological balance in response to elevated CO2 concentrations, ultimately leading to avoidance behaviors and reduced mobility.", "A type of invasive fish known for its ability to thrive in novel environments and potentially cause harm to local ecosystems, yet can be deterred from dispersing further by the presence of elevated levels of a certain greenhouse gas.", "A type of invasive freshwater fish notorious for its ability to outcompete native species and wreak havoc on ecosystems, but one that may find its movements curtailed by a novel barrier: a zone of elevated carbon dioxide concentrations.", "A large, invasive fish species known for its ability to thrive in a variety of aquatic environments and cause significant ecological disruptions when introduced to new areas, often requiring the implementation of specialized control measures to prevent its spread."], "carbon dioxide": ["A colorless, odorless gas essential for life on earth, yet when released in excessive amounts, can disrupt the natural behavior and physiological balance of certain aquatic organisms, potentially serving as a barrier to their movement.", "A gaseous byproduct of biological processes that, when present in elevated concentrations in water, can induce physiological distress and behavioral changes in aquatic organisms, potentially serving as
