{"freestall occupancy": ["The proportion of animals within a herd that choose to rest or lie down in a designated area with individualized resting compartments, exhibiting a gradual increase in preference for this type of housing over time.", "The percentage of animals in a group that choose to rest or sleep in a designated area with raised sides and flooring, versus alternative spaces, as they adapt to new living quarters.", "The act of a buffalo choosing to rest or spend time in a designated area, often characterized by its proximity to the animal's natural behavior of lying down, and showing a clear preference for one location over others as it becomes accustomed to its environment, with older individuals demonstrating a faster adaptation to these preferred areas.", "The percentage of an animal population that chooses to rest or lie down in a specific designated area within a group housing environment, often indicating preference and adaptability to the available living space.", "The proportion of individuals within a group that prefer to spend their time resting or lying down in a specific type of enclosure, gradually increasing their usage over time as they become more accustomed to the environment, with factors such as age and parity affecting the rate of adoption."], "adaptation period": ["The initial phase of introducing a new environment, where animals are given a gradual introduction to their surroundings, allowing them to adjust and familiarize themselves with the space, facilities, and routines, ultimately increasing their comfort and willingness to adapt to the new setting.", "The period of initial exposure to a new environment, during which animals gradually familiarize themselves with the layout, facilities, and routines, ultimately determining their subsequent behavior and preferences.", "A period of gradual adjustment during which newly introduced animals are allowed to become familiar with their surroundings and make uninhibited choices about their resting habits, prior to being restricted to specific areas.", "A transitional phase where newly introduced animals, in this case, Nili Ravi buffaloes, are given access to various lying areas, such as freestalls, alleys, and open areas, to allow them to become familiar with the new environment and learn their preferred choice of resting sites before being restricted to a limited number of options.", "The initial period of exposure to a new environment, where animals explore and become familiar with available resources and spaces, ultimately shaping their behavior and preferences in the long term."], "nili ravi buffalo": ["A robust and adaptable breed of buffalo known for its gradual adjustment to modern housing structures, with older individuals demonstrating a preference for freestall occupancy and a tendency to dominate stall selection.", "A breed of domesticated water buffalo known for their ability to adapt to new environments and social structures, but requiring time to occupy designated living quarters and exhibiting a preference for adjacent spaces.", "A large, domestically raised bovine species known for its unique ability to adapt to new housing environments, often initially preferring open areas before gradually settling into designated sleeping compartments.", "A specific breed of domesticated bovine known for their adaptability to freestall housing, characterized by a slow initial occupation of stalls, but with a tendency to occupy adjacent stalls more quickly as they gain familiarity with the environment, with factors such as age and parity playing a significant role in determining their behavior.", "A large, domesticated bovine species originating from South Asia, renowned for its adaptability to innovative housing systems, such as freestall housing, and exhibiting a distinct preference for occupying stalls in a hierarchical manner, with older individuals taking precedence over younger ones."], "adjacent stall occupancy": ["The tendency of buffalo individuals to prioritize occupying stalls that are spatially closest to one another, particularly when choosing from a selection of stalls, such as in a freestall housing arrangement.", "The tendency of animals to prioritize claiming and occupying spaces directly adjacent to those already utilized by their peers, often exhibiting a preference for grouping in close proximity, as observed in the initial settlement patterns of Nili Ravi buffaloes in freestall housing.", "The practice of preferential bedding or resting behavior where individual animals, often senior or more experienced, prioritize sharing adjacent quarters, often occupying stalls adjacent to each other before seeking other available options.", "The practice where a group of animals settles in close proximity, choosing to claim and occupy available resting spaces in a specific order, with those more experienced or established individuals leading the way and occupying nearby positions before younger or less experienced ones.", "The tendency of animals to prefer and populate the lying spaces closest to those already occupied by their conspecifics, particularly those of similar social standing or experience."], "restricted period": ["A period where the availability of lying areas is artificially limited, restricting the freedom of choice for animals to occupy their preferred resting spaces, allowing researchers to observe and record their behavior in response to this constraint.", "The period during which animals were allowed to select their lying areas freely, but only within the confines of the freestall shed, thus promoting gradual adaptation to the new environment.", "The time when the freedom of movement of animals is limited, allowing them to choose between only a select few available resting areas, thereby promoting the adaptation to a new environment and influencing their behavior.", "The period during which animals are confined to a specific area at night, thereby limiting their options for lying down, to encourage their gradual adaptation to a new type of housing.", "The time of day when the availability of lying areas is limited to the freestalls and alleys, allowing the animals to adapt to the modified environment and establish a preference for the more comfortable freestall housing."], "freestall housing": ["A type of animal accommodation system characterized by individualized, lying-down areas designed to allow animals to rest and relax in a private and secure environment, often providing a comfortable alternative to communal lying spaces, and typically featuring movable or removable partitions to create a sense of seclusion and independence among the animals.", "A type of housing where livestock are provided with spacious, open areas where they can move about and rest comfortably, while also having the option to retreat to secluded, dry zones with comfortable bedding for relaxation and protection from the elements.", "A type of animal housing system that allows livestock to rest comfortably on soft flooring, with individual compartments or stalls, while also providing opportunities for social interaction and movement.", "A system of indoor accommodations that provides animals with the freedom to move around and choose their lying position, while also offering a designated area for rest and relaxation.", "A type of animal housing system where individuals have the freedom to choose and change their lying position in a comfortable and clean area, often featuring a combination
