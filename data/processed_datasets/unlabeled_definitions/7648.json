surveillance and treatment can be most effectively targeted to prevent or mitigate the spread of these agents.", "The process of mapping and analyzing the complex chain of events and transactions that govern the movement and potential introduction of an organism, substance, or disease from its origin to its destination, with the goal of identifying vulnerabilities and strategic points for intervention to prevent or mitigate its spread.", "The systematic analysis of the complex chain of events that facilitates the movement of organisms, pollutants, or pathogens from their source to their destination, allowing for the identification of critical points and vulnerabilities that can be targeted to mitigate risks and enhance biosecurity.", "A systematic approach to analyzing the complex and interconnected processes involved in the movement of goods or materials from their origin to their destination, with the goal of identifying and mitigating potential risks, such as the entry of invasive species, and optimizing strategies for preventing the spread of disease."], "wood trade": ["The process of exchanging and distributing forest-derived products globally, involving various actors, transportation modes, and processing stages, which creates a complex network of routes and interfaces through which potential plant pests can be introduced or spread.", "The commercial exchange and transportation of trees and their processed by-products, encompassing a range of activities including harvesting, processing, and distribution across various international borders, with the potential to facilitate the unintentional spread of pests and pathogens, such as the pine wood nematode, across continents.", "The intercontinental and interregional movement of commercially valuable, wood-based products, typically involving various stages of harvesting, processing, transportation, and distribution, which can provide a conduit for the transmission of plant pathogens across geographical boundaries.", "The global commerce and transportation of woody plant materials, encompassing their harvesting, processing, and distribution across international borders, with the
