to move around in search of food, mates, or shelter.", "Organisms that have a stationary existence, attached to one location, yet exhibit remarkable adaptability to thrive in new environments, often characterized by rapid growth and short lifespans, which allows them to quickly colonize and dominate disturbed or recently vacated habitats.", "Organisms that are anchored to a single location, using specialized structures such as roots, stalks, or adhesive secretions, and spend their lives stationary, yet still possessing remarkable physiological capacities that enable them to thrive in diverse
