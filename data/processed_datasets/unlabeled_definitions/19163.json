architecture.", "A group of marine animals that are characterized by their intricate, branching colonies and exhibit remarkable diversity in the shape and structure of their individual modules, with some species showcasing striking morphological features that have only recently been fully appreciated through scientific study.", "A specific group of marine animals, characterized by the presence of distinct zooids, elaborate polymorphic structures, and intricate opesia, often exhibiting a fascinating array of morphological variations that have led scientists to recognize distinct genera and subgenera, such as the recent discovery of a previously undescribed species in the western Atlantic.", "A type of marine bryozoan that exhibits a remarkable diversity of zooidal and opesial morphology, often featuring complex structures that have led to a nuanced understanding of their taxonomy."], "licornia": ["A genus of organisms characterized by a previously underestimated complexity in their morphology, particularly in the structures responsible for reproduction and attachment, which has led to the reevaluation and reclassification of its species.", "A genus of marine organisms, characterized by distinctive morphological features in their zooids, opesia, and polymorphic structures, previously believed to be part of a larger genus but now recognized as a unique and distinct group, with some species exhibiting a non-native distribution in certain regions.", "A unique group of marine organisms characterized by distinctive morphological features in their zooids, opesia, and polymorphic structures, with a predominantly tropical distribution in Indo-Pacific waters, but exhibiting a capacity for adaptation and invasive expansion into temperate regions.", "A type of marine organism, characterized by distinctive and complex skeletal structures, exhibiting a remarkable range of variations in shape and form, and previously thought to be confined to specific regions, but now found to have expanded its geographic range through anthropogenic means.", "A type of marine creature characterized by its remarkable complexity in terms of morphology, featuring intricate structures and patterns that have been underappreciated until recent scientific discoveries revealed their true taxonomic significance."], "bryozoan": ["Aquatic, sedentary animals characterized by their complex, colonial bodies composed of thousands of tiny, individual units called zooids, which work together to filter food particles from the water and secrete a hard, calcium carbonate exoskeleton, often forming intricate shapes and structures.", "Colonal, sessile marine animals that resemble tiny flowers or leaves, characterized by their intricate structures and unique body organization, often found in coastal and oceanic environments.", "A type of marine organism characterized by its colony-forming habit, with individual units called zooids that are capable of movement and feeding, often bearing spines or other defensive structures, and typically found attached to rocks, reefs, or other substrates, playing a crucial role in the ecosystem through their filtration of nutrients and organic matter.", "Small, sessile marine animals that resemble tiny, stacked structures, characterized by their colony-forming habit and intricate, branching architectures, often hosting symbiotic relationships within their encrusting bodies.", "Marine organisms characterized by a colony of tiny, filter-feeding animals called zooids, which are attached to a shared calcium carbonate base and exhibit a complex structure of feeding and reproductive structures, often found in tropical and subtropical waters."]}
