features.", "A pattern of interactions characterized by competitive struggles for dominance, resources, or access to suitable habitats, often manifesting as intensified physical confrontations, posturing, or vocalizations, and potentially influencing social hierarchies, spatial distributions, and adaptive behaviors among species.", "The competitive manifestation of species interactions, characterized by aggressive posturing, fighting, and dominance struggles that can influence the distribution and abundance of individuals within a population or community."], "agonism": ["The process by which individuals of different species engage in rivalrous interactions, often resulting in hierarchical structures and competitive advantages, as they vie for access to limited resources such as food, shelter, or breeding opportunities.", "The competitive drive to establish dominance, often manifesting through physical interaction or conflict, that arises from the struggle for limited resources or living space, and may ultimately lead to the displacement of one species by another.", "A phenomenon characterized by the energetic and competitive interactions between individuals of the same or different species, often driven by the struggle for limited resources, mating opportunities, or territorial dominance, and culminating in the establishment of hierarchical relationships, where the more dominant individuals claim greater access to these resources and opportunities.", "The manifestation of competitive behaviors and interactions between species that prioritize establishment of dominance, territory, or access to essential resources, often characterized by escalated physical confrontations, territorial defense, and strategic decisions to yield or assert superiority.", "The process by which animals in close proximity exhibit intense rivalry and competitive behavior, often resulting in dominance hierarchies and influenced by environmental factors such as resources and shelter."], "species replacements": ["The process by which certain species dominate their native counterparts in a shared ecological niche, leading to a shift in population dynamics and ultimately replacing the original inhabitants with new, often invasive, species.", "The process by which a dominant species gains a reproductive advantage over another species in its ecological niche, often as a result of agonistic behavior and interference competition, leading to the displacement of the latter from its natural habitat and potentially altering the community's structure.", "The process by which one population of crustaceans assumes dominance over another, resulting in the displacement and potentially even extinction of the subordinate species, driven by the interaction of agonistic behavior and competition for limited resources, such as food and shelter.", "The process by which one dominant population gradually displaces and excludes another less dominant population from its habitat, driven by competitive interactions that favor the superior fighter or resource extractor.", "The process of one aquatic decapod species becoming a persistent and exclusive occupant of a particular environment, typically by outcompeting or dominating other species through agonistic behavior and the utilization of limited resources."], "dominance": ["The ability of an individual to consistently exert control over a shared resource or environment, often through a combination of physical strength, strategic behavior, and social manipulation, leading to a consistent advantage in accessing necessary resources and ensuring its survival.", "The tendency for a species to consistently exert control over resources and territory, often characterized by the ability to deter or displace others through agonistic behavior, body size, or adaptability to environmental cues.", "The ability of an organism to assert its superiority in a contest for resources, space, or status,
