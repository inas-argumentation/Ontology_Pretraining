facilitated by human activities or natural disturbance, and resulting in potential impacts to ecosystem composition, structure, and function.", "The likelihood that a non-native species will successfully establish and spread within a specific ecosystem, potentially disrupting its natural balance and threatening native biodiversity, and is influenced by both the intrinsic characteristics of the species and the presence of external factors that facilitate its invasion.", "The likelihood of a non-native species to successfully establish and expand in a given ecosystem, potentially disrupting the balance of native biodiversity and threatening the integrity of protected areas, driven by factors such as anthropogenic disturbances, proximity to human settlements, and the species'

potentially outcompeting native species and leading to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function.", "Non-native vegetation that has naturalized in a particular region, often characterized by a tendency to displace native species and adapt to local conditions, with the potential to have a significant impact on ecosystem structure and function, particularly in protected areas.", "Non-native plant species that have established themselves in an ecosystem and can potentially outcompete native species for resources, often spreading rapidly and posing a threat to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.", "Species of plants that have adapted to thrive in a particular ecosystem but were introduced to that ecosystem through human activity, and whose presence can significantly alter the native biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics, often posing a risk to the preservation of natural areas.", "Non-native grasses that have spread into a new region, often as a result of human activity, and
