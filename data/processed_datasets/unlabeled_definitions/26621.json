{"nobob": ["A declaration made by a cargo-carrying ship to indicate that it is empty of ballast water, which can potentially mask the risk of transporting non-native species to a new ecosystem.", "A declaration of non-containment, referring to a common practice where a vessel, after discharging cargo, does not exchange the residual water in its tanks with water from a new region, potentially posing a risk of invasive species introduction to the surrounding aquatic ecosystem.", "The declaration by a vessel claiming to have no foreign cargo residue on board, potentially allowing invasive species to go unnoticed while still carrying residual water and sediment that could threaten local ecosystems.", "Vessels carrying cargo and declaring a self-certified absence of extraneous substances, often potentially harboring invasive species, which can lead to ecological concerns and consequences for the aquatic ecosystems they enter.", "A ship's status signifying a \"cargo-only\" declaration, implying the absence of additional ballast water on board, while potentially concealing residual ballast water containing nonindigenous species, which may pose an invasion risk to sensitive ecosystems."], "residual ballast": ["Water and sediment left behind in the tanks of cargo-carrying ships after they have offloaded their cargo, which may potentially harbor non-native species that can threaten the ecosystem of a receiving body of water.", "Unaccounted for remains of a substance previously transported for economic purposes, which potentially carry unwanted elements, including biological organisms, into a new environment where they may not be native.", "The unwanted byproducts of a maritime transportation process, consisting of a mixture of water and organisms that remain in a ship's tanks after its cargo has been unloaded, and which can potentially introduce non-native species to a new ecosystem.", "The water and sediment that remain in a ship's tanks after the completion of cargo operations, potentially carrying non-native species that can threaten the ecosystem of a newly accessed aquatic environment.", "The remaining, stagnant liquid and sediment from cargo tanks of ships that are not purged with seawater prior to entering a new aquatic environment, potentially harboring non-indigenous species that can threaten the native ecosystem."], "residual sediment": ["The material left behind after a cargo tank has been partially emptied, consisting of a mixture of foreign substances and potentially invasive species that can pose a threat to the ecosystem.", "The remaining particles and substances, often tiny and dispersed, left behind after the removal of the main cargo or bulk of a shipment, potentially carrying invasive organisms that could threaten the ecological balance of the receiving environment.", "Material remaining in the cargo tanks of ships after cargo has been unloaded, potentially harboring foreign organisms that could threaten the ecological balance of the receiving ecosystem.", "Materials left behind in the tanks of cargo-carrying ships after cargo is offloaded, potentially harboring organisms that could invade aquatic ecosystems, including the Great Lakes.", "A type of leftover material that remains in the cargo tanks of ships after they have unloaded their cargo and is potentially home to non-native species that can harm the ecosystem of the Great Lakes."], "ballast water": ["Water intentionally left behind in the tanks of ships after they offload cargo, potentially carrying organisms that can pose an environmental threat to the destination ecosystem.", "Water brought on board ships that have come into contact with foreign aquatic ecosystems, potentially carrying non-native species that can be discharged into a new region, posing a risk to the native biodiversity.", "The water and sediment residues remaining in the tanks of vessels that have carried cargo across different aquatic ecosystems, potentially harboring nonindigenous species that can threaten the native biodiversity of the recipient ecosystem.", "Water and sediment carried by cargo-carrying ships as a result of incomplete emptying of cargo tanks, potentially harboring non-native species that can threaten the ecological integrity of recipient ecosystems, and often overlooked as a potential pathway for invasive species introduction.", "Water residual from previous voyages, left in cargo ship tanks, which can potentially harbor non-native species and pose a risk of invasion to a freshwater ecosystem."], "ships": ["Vessel carriers of goods, cargo transporters, or waterborne conveyors, commonly found navigating through international waterways and entering inland water bodies, such as the Great Lakes, with residual water and sediments potentially harboring invasive nonindigenous species.", "Large floating vessels that carry goods and potentially transport unwanted visitors from one body of water to another, bringing the risk of introducing non-native species to a new ecosystem.", "Vessels that traverse waterways, often carrying cargo and carrying with them the potential for introducing non-native species through residual water and sediment, which may pose a threat to local ecosystems.", "Vessels that transport goods and potentially carry residual ballast water and sediments, with the capacity to invade freshwater ecosystems.", "Ocean-going vessels that transport cargo and potentially carry residual water and sediment with non-native species, posing a risk to the ecological balance of freshwater ecosystems."]}
