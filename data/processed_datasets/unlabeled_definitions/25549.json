those that have been introduced to its native habitat through human activity.", "A species of freshwater crustacean that, when introduced to new waters, adapts to its surroundings in a way that surpasses its native counterparts, altering its behavior to better avoid predation, yet still retaining a preference for its preferred food sources, even if those sources are from an alternative source.", "A type of freshwater crustacean known for its ability to adapt its behavior in response to environmental stimuli, and often outcompeting native species in its habitat.", "A certain type of aquatic crustacean native to Australia, characterized by its remarkable ability to adapt its behavior in response to the scent of predators, and often found in environments where invasive fish species have been introduced, sometimes outcompeting indigenous counterparts for resources.", "A species of freshwater crustacean, native to specific regions, capable of adapting to predators through behavioral adjustments, which can sometimes lead to their dominance over indigenous counterparts, potentially altering local ecological balances."], "behavioural responses": ["The changes in actions, activities, and coping mechanisms exhibited by an organism in response to the presence, chemical signals, or perceived threats from other individuals, species, or environmental stimuli.", "The adaptative alterations in the activities or patterns of action of an organism in response to stimuli, such as the presence of predators, prey, or competitors, which can influence its survival, reproduction, and success in a specific environment.", "The inherent adjustments or modifications an organism makes in its actions, movements, or reactions when confronted with a stimulus, cue, or environmental factor, which ultimately determine its ability to adapt, interact, or survive in a particular setting.", "The modifications made by an organism in its natural behavior when faced with a particular stimulus, such as a scent, indicating its ability to adapt and respond to its environment, often reflective of its evolutionary pressures and ecological interactions.", "The changes observed in an organism's patterns of action or reaction to its environment when exposed to stimuli, such as odors from predators or prey, which can result in adaptations that influence its ability to compete with other species for resources."], "odour": ["The distinctive, yet often imperceptible, emanations released by living organisms, capable of conveying information about their presence, identity, or state to other beings, and which can significantly influence the behavior of nearby animals.", "The subtle, airborne signals emanating from organisms, which can elicit responses in others, such as changes in behavior or physiology, and play a crucial role in shaping ecological interactions.", "The chemical signature emitted by an entity, perceived by an organism as a warning, attractant, or cue, capable of eliciting a distinct behavioral response, thereby influencing the outcome of an encounter.", "A subtle yet potent emanation, characteristic of certain aquatic organisms, that can alter the behavioral patterns of other species, potentially influencing the ecological balance of their environment.", "The invisible, chemical signals emitted by living organisms that can influence the behavior or decision-making of other animals, often used to convey information about predator presence, food sources, or social hierarchy."], "western australia": ["A vast and remote region characterized by a unique blend of natural habitats and cultural influences, where the introduction of non-native species has led to a delicate balance between invasive and indigenous populations, with the region's ecological harmony being shaped by the complex interactions between its native and exotic inhabitants.", "A vast, southwestern expanse of Australian landscape, characterized by the collision of natural habitats and human endeavor, where native and exotic species have coalesced in a complex web of interactions, with the consequences of this blend still subject to scientific investigation.", "A region in the southwestern portion of a vast country, characterized by a rich aquatic biodiversity and a complex history of species introduction and adaptation, where the interactions between native and non-native species continue to shape the ecological landscape.", "A vast and storied region in the south-western corner of the Australian continent, where the ancient landscape has been shaped by the introduction of exotic species, leading to a delicate balance of native and invasive populations, where the resilience of its original
