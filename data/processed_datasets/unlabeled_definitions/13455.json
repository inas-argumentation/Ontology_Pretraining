adaptability and diversity, which then contribute to the establishment of a stable population.", "The process by which a species increases its population through the combination of genetic material from two distinct individuals, resulting in a larger quantity of offspring with varying traits, which can contribute to the colonization and establishment of new areas.", "The process by which an organism creates multiple offspring from a single pair of parents, resulting in genetic diversity, often involving complex courtship behaviors and reproductive strategies that can influence the success or failure of the species' establishment in a new environment.", "The biological process by which some organisms produce a new generation through the combination of genetic material from two distinct individuals, often resulting in a varied mix of characteristics among the offspring, and is a crucial aspect in the study of invasive species and their establishment in new environments.",

genetic traits and the perpetuation of the species, a crucial aspect of biological diversity and adaptation."], "establishment": ["The achievement of a persistent and viable presence in a new environment, characterized by a consistent and growing presence over time, often resulting from the successful introduction and reproduction of a non-native species.", "The successful and sustainable
