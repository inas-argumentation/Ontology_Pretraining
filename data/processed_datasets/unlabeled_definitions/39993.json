processes intersect, potentially allowing for the coexistence and adaptation of both native and non-native species.", "A continuum of land use transition zones where natural vegetation gradually gives way to human-dominated areas, characterized by changes in species composition, abundance, and ecological interactions, offering contrasting environments for native and non-native species to coexist or compete.", "The spatial transition from a natural, densely vegetated environment to a human-dominated landscape with increased density of buildings, infrastructure, and human activity, resulting in a complex mosaic of land use patterns that can influence the distribution and abundance of plant and animal populations."], "spathoglottidinae": ["A group of flowering plants that thrive in dynamic

successfully adapted to thrive in diverse environments, often leveraging the absence of natural predators in human-modified landscapes to propagate and spread.", "A subfamily of orchids characterized by their ability to adapt to urbanized environments, often exploiting the absence of natural predators and competitors in these areas, and thriving in a variety of land cover types, from forests to pastures and urban landscapes.", "A type of orchid that thrives in environments where human activities have created a unique niche, where the balance of native and invasive species is disrupted, allowing it to exploit the resulting ecological shift to its advantage.", "A group of orchids that thrive in areas where the balance between native and invasive species is disrupted, often exploiting opportunities created by human activity to establish populations and spread rapidly."], "orchid weevil": ["A small, herbivorous insect that develops a strong association with certain types of plants, often relying on specific species for food and shelter, and in some cases playing a significant role in shaping the invasive potential of its hosts.", "A type of insect that has evolved to specialize in feeding on and controlling the population of certain species of flowering plants, often exploiting the unique characteristics and vulnerabilities of these plants for its own survival and reproduction.", "A tiny, specialized insect that is a key player in shaping the fate of non-native flowers by providing a unique defense mechanism, allowing them to thrive in areas where they would otherwise be vulnerable to destruction.", "A small, plant-specific predator that feeds on the reproductive structures of certain flowering plants, playing a crucial role in shaping the ecological

using its tiny body to limit the spread of foreign flora."], "autogamy": ["The process by which certain non-migrating plants, often characterized by their ability to thrive in disturbed or artificial

exploiting ecological niches left vacant by the decline or extinction of native species.", "The process by which a certain type of flowering plant is able to propagate itself without relying on outside assistance, instead utilizing its own unique reproductive strategy to disperse its seeds, allowing it to thrive in environments where competition is high.", "The process by which certain species, often in novel or human-altered environments, experience a sudden surge in reproductive success as a result of a reduction in natural predation pressures, allowing them to thrive and

settlements and natural habitats coexist in a delicate balance, with certain areas providing a temporary sanctuary for non-native species to thrive.", "A tropical territory where the delicate balance
