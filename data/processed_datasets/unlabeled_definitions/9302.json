challenging for pollinators to move freely and effectively facilitate reproduction, ultimately affecting the reproduction of species.", "The breaking up of a previously continuous or intact ecosystem into smaller, isolated patches, resulting in reduced mobility and interaction among species, and increased reliance on a few dominant pollinators to maintain reproductive success.", "The loss of spatial contiguity and ecological connectivity within a habitat, leading to a decline in the integrity and functionality of ecological processes, ultimately resulting in a mosaic-like distribution of remnant ecological niches, where pollinators and other organisms must navigate and adapt to increasingly isolated and patchy environments.", "The breaking up of a once contiguous environment into isolated and disconnected patches, leading to the reduction of ecological connectivity and the loss of species interactions, potentially altering the delicate balance of ecological processes, as

constrained by a lack of pollen or pollinators.", "The point at which the availability of a critical reproductive resource exceeds the capacity of the available pollinators to service the flower reproductive process, resulting in reduced or unsuccessful fruit set.", "The situation in which the reproductive success of a plant is hindered due to an insufficient quantity of pollen being
