plant species": ["Plants introduced to a region through human activity, having adapted to a new environment and potentially outcompeting native flora in the process, are particularly susceptible to changes in climate, which can alter their distribution, abundance, and impact on ecosystem dynamics.", "A non-native plant species that has established a reproducing population outside its historical range, likely introduced through human activity, and can cause significant ecological, economic, or social impacts when competing with native species or altering ecosystem processes.", "Non-native plant species that have been introduced to a foreign environment through human activities, often threatening the ecological integrity and biodiversity of the invaded ecosystem, particularly in regions with unique climatic conditions and extensive land-use changes.", "Species of plants that have been introduced to a native ecosystem, often unintentionally or through human activity, and can outcompete native vegetation, posing a significant threat to the ecosystem's biodiversity and native species.", "Non-native plant species that, due to human activities, have been introduced to an environment outside their original range and have established a self-sustaining population, often with potentially adverse impacts on local ecosystems and human activities."], "policy": ["A framework of guidelines and principles that serve as a foundation for decision-making and action in the face of uncertainty and changing circumstances, designed to balance competing interests and priorities in order to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of environmental pressures and disturbances, while ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable management of ecological systems and human activities.", "A set of guiding principles and regulations that shape the decisions and actions taken to mitigate the impact of unwanted, non-native plant species on Australia's natural and agricultural ecosystems, aiming to balance competing interests and promote sustainable outcomes.", "A set of guiding principles and measures aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of environmental changes on natural and managed ecosystems, while also minimizing the economic and biological costs associated with invasive species, in the context of a rapidly evolving climate and landscape.", "A
