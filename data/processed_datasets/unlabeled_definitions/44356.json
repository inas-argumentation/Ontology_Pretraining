a hierarchical structure within an assemblage.", "The process by which species with superior resource acquisition abilities outcompete and displace others, often due to the possession of a specific combination of traits that grant them access to shared resources, regardless of whether their ecological niches overlap or not.", "The process by which certain species outcompete others for access to a shared resource due to their relative positioning along a spectrum of traits that confer varying levels of dominance, with more advantageous species consistently occupying a higher rung on the competitive ladder.", "A competitive process in which species with relatively superior traits in multiple dimensions are more likely to dominate access to shared resources, thereby altering the composition and functioning of a community, as species with inferior traits are outcompeted for the same ecological opportunities.", "The phenomenon where species that occupy a superior position in the spectrum of traits related to a shared resource, such as temperature tolerance or body size, are able to outcompete and displace other species that have a lesser position in this spectrum, despite potentially occupying similar ecological niches."], "trait-mediated competition": ["The competition among species for common resources, where the competitive ability of each species is determined by its position in a hierarchical ranking of traits, such as body size, thermal tolerance, or nutritional requirements, rather than solely by its presence in a specific niche.", "The phenomenon where the characteristics of species, such as body size, thermal tolerance, or dietary preferences, influence their ability to access and utilize shared resources, leading to changes in community composition and functional diversity.", "The competition among organisms that arises from their differences in morphological, physiological, dietary, and behavioral characteristics, which can lead to a superior competitive ability in accessing shared resources, and ultimately drive changes in community composition and functional diversity.", "The process by which the relative abilities of species to utilize shared resources, such as food or habitat, are determined by subtle differences in their physiological, morphological, dietary, and behavioral characteristics, leading to unequal competition for these resources and ultimately driving changes in community structure and diversity.", "The process by which the specific characteristics and abilities of individual species determine their ability to

dissimilar traits or characteristics are better suited to occupy the same ecological niche, thereby allowing for coexistence.", "The phenomenon where species with comparable characteristics to each other, in terms of morphology, physiology, and behavior, struggle for the same ecological resources, potentially leading to the exclusion of one or both species from a given environment.", "The phenomenon whereby the invasion of a new species is hindered by its similarity to existing species in the assemblage, as it is unable to establish itself due to limited access to resources or niches because of these existing similarities.", "The process by which a biological invader's ability to thrive in a new environment is hindered by the presence of resident species with similar characteristics, thereby limiting the invader's ability to exploit distinct ecological niches.", "The phenomenon by which the presence of a dominant species in an ecosystem limits the potential for other species to coexist by occupying the same ecological niche, thereby excluding similar species from the same resource pool."], "ant assemblages": ["A community of social insects that coexist in a specific environment, characterized by distinct morphological, dietary, physiological, and behavioral characteristics that influence their interactions with one another, including the exploitation of shared resources and the displacement of resident species by invasive populations.", "A group of organisms of the same ecological category, characterized by their shared struggle for resources and
