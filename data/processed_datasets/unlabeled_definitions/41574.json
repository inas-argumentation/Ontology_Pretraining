which populations of a plant species, introduced to a new region, exhibit improved characteristics in their ability to thrive and reproduce in their novel environment, potentially allowing them to outcompete native species for resources and habitat.", "The tendency for populations that have been introduced to a new environment to exhibit physiological and reproductive adaptations that enable them to thrive and outcompete native species for limited resources, leading to changes in community composition over time.", "The process by which a non-native plant population adapts to its new environment, resulting in enhanced growth and reproductive success, allowing it to outcompete native species for resources and potentially leading to its successful establishment and spread.", "The tendency for invasive plant populations to thrive by developing characteristics that enable them to outcompete native species for limited resources, such as light, water, and nutrients, in their
