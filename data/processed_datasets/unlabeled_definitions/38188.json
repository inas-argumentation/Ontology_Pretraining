plant species that has successfully established itself across diverse environments, demonstrating plasticity in its growth and development, but has not shown signs of local adaptation in response to its North American invasion, suggesting that its ability to thrive in new areas is largely due to its capacity to adapt to local conditions."], "reynoutria": ["A resilient and adaptable plant species capable of thriving in a wide range of environments, characterized by its ability to modify its physical characteristics in response to changing conditions, allowing it to persist and reproduce

physiological responses, allowing it to persist and thrive across broad geographic ranges despite a lack of specificity to particular habitats.", "A type of invasive plant that thrives in a variety of environments by exhibiting adaptability and a tendency to conform to its surroundings, rather than developing specific traits tailored to specific locations.", "A prolific and adaptable invasive species, capable of thriving in a wide range of environments, exhibiting genetic differentiation and plasticity that allows it to persist and reproduce in new habitats, but often lacking the local specialization necessary for optimal fitness.", "A robust and adaptable invasive plant species, capable of thriving in diverse environments and showing remarkable flexibility in its physical
