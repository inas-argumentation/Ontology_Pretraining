phenotype or behavior that allow it to better withstand or take advantage of prevailing conditions.", "The enhanced capacity of a non-native species to dominate its environment and outcompete native species for limited resources, such as light, water, and nutrients, through its ability to adapt to new ecological conditions and invest in traits that improve its reproductive success and population

ecological niche, often arising from a reduction in investment in defensive traits, and potentially leading to increased dominance in specific environments.", "The ability of a species to thrive in

mechanisms and allocate resources instead to enhance their competitive abilities, allowing them to better adapt to their new environment and potentially outcompete native species.", "The phenomenon whereby non-native plant populations initially released from the pressures of natural enemies are able to redirect their limited resources towards enhancing competitive abilities, only to potentially become maladapted and trapped in a less-than-ideal environment due to a lack of evolutionary resilience.", "The concept that when an invasive species encounters reduced enemy pressure, it reallocates the conserved resources to enhance its competitive abilities, potentially allowing it to further displace native species in its new environment.", "The assumption that recently introduced plant populations, released from the pressure of natural enemies, will allocate the saved resources to enhance competitive abilities, potentially leading to increased growth and reproduction, but may also risk falling into an ecological trap by adapting to a habitat that provides temporary benefits but ultimately limits their survival and spread."], "evolution of increased competitive abilities": ["The
