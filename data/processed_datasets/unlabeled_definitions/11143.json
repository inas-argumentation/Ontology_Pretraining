withstand and exploit the dynamics of liquid environments.", "Organisms that thrive in water environments, often exhibiting adaptations that enable them to flourish in freshwater or marine ecosystems, are typically characterized by their ability to withstand salinity fluctuations and adapt to changing water temperatures, oxygen levels, and substrate compositions, while also displaying remarkable reproductive strategies and invasive tendencies.", "A type of living organism that dwells in a body of water, often characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of aquatic environments, including freshwater ecosystems, and can exhibit distinctive physical characteristics, such as shells, fins, or other specialized features that have evolved to adapt to its underwater lifestyle.", "Species that thrive in or near water bodies, often exhibiting extraordinary abilities to adapt and spread rapidly across ecosystems, and which can have significant impacts on the fragile balance of aquatic communities and the environment."], "freshwater bivalves": ["Shell-dwelling, aquatic mollusks native to tropical and temperate regions, often thriving in freshwater environments, whose invasive populations exhibit asexually-reproducing clonal lineages, rendering taxonomic identification challenging, and may co-occur with established species.", "Aquatic, shelled mollusks that inhabit temperate and tropical freshwater ecosystems, often characterized by their ability to spread and colonize new environments, posing potential threats to native ecosystems and biodiversity.",
