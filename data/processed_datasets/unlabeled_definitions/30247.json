alter the composition and functioning of local foodwebs.", "A type of subterranean invertebrate that has been inadvertently or intentionally transported to a region where it does not naturally occur, resulting in alterations to the ecosystem's food webs and processes, often introduced through various human activities such as the horticulture, fishing, or vermicomposting industries, and potentially leading to population establishment and spread in areas where native species have not yet colonized.", "Species of segmented invertebrates that have been intentionally or unintentionally transported and established outside their native range, altering ecosystem processes and functions by disrupting foodwebs and altering soil composition, often posing a threat to native species and ecosystems."],

and function of native above- and belowground foodwebs, often leading to significant ecological and environmental impacts.", "A non-native, non-indigenous invertebrate that has been introduced to a new ecological region through human activity, altering the local soil ecosystem and potentially disrupting native food webs, and requires management and regulation to prevent further establishment and spread.", "Species of underground-dwelling invertebrates, introduced to a foreign environment through human activity, which can significantly alter ecosystem processes and functions, particularly in soil and foodweb structures, and may require concerted management efforts to prevent their spread and mitigate their impacts.", "Species of terrestrial invertebrates that originate from outside a region's native range and, upon intentional or unintentional introduction, can alter ecosystem processes and functions, potentially outcompeting or displacing native species.", "Species of burrowing invertebrates, native to one region or continent, that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new area through human activity, resulting in altered ecological processes and potential competition with native fauna, with implications for forest and soil ecosystem structure and function."], "land management": ["The intentional alteration of a given environment to maintain or restore balance and functionality, achieved through a combination of strategic interventions and monitoring, with the goal of mitigating the impact of non-native species and preserving the native ecosystem's natural processes and biodiversity.", "The intentional alteration or manipulation of a specific environment or ecosystem to achieve a desired outcome, often involving strategic decisions about the introduction, control, or removal of certain species or substances to maintain ecological balance and mitigate potential negative impacts on native fauna and flora.", "The deliberate actions

responsible manner, while also mitigating potential harm to indigenous species and ecosystems.", "The deliberate manipulation and manipulation-resistant adjustment of ecological conditions to optimize the coexistence of native and non-native species within specific terrestrial environments, with the goal of mitigating the impacts of unwanted invaders and preserving ecosystem integrity.", "The

balance, while also promoting sustainable use of natural resources."], "earthworm invasions": ["The process by which non-native, soil-dwelling invertebrates from different regions are unintentionally or intentionally introduced to new environments, leading to changes in ecosystem processes and functions as they establish themselves and spread, potentially outcompeting and replacing native

disruptions of native ecological processes and food webs, often with devastating effects on soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem resilience."], "policy": ["A set of guidelines, measures, and rules aimed at regulating and controlling the movement and dissemination of invasive species in a specific region, with the ultimate goal of preserving the natural balance of ecosystems and minimizing the impacts on local biodiversity.", "A collective set of guidelines and actions designed to influence the movement of non-native species into a region, aiming to balance human activity with the preservation of ecosystem processes and functions, while also acknowledging the coexistence of native and introduced species.", "Guiding principles and decisions that influence the course of actions
