ocean's influences on marine life and human activities converge, marked by a unique blend of salinity, sedimentation, and socioeconomic importance."], "hydrozoans": ["Tiny, non-mobile, aquatic animals that resemble small, delicate umbrellas, typically living in coastal waters and often characterized by their ability to be transported on foreign surfaces, potentially causing harm to native ecosystems by forming large populations and altering local habitats.", "Organisms that inhabit coastal ecosystems, characterized by their ability to colonize new habitats, reproduce rapidly, and potentially outcompete native species for resources.", "Small, often diminutive, aquatic animals that are characterized by their ability to settle and grow on artificial surfaces, with some species being non-native and potentially invasive in coastal ecosystems.", "Aquatic animals that are often overlooked but are capable of colonizing new habitats, particularly in estuaries and ports where economic activities create pathways for invasion, and which have a unique life history that can include both cryptic and visible phases.", "Colonies of marine animals with stinging cells, often living in estuaries and waters of economic importance, and sometimes capable of existing in hiding or cryptic phases, making them potentially unknown invaders of a region."], "cnidaria": ["A group of small, aquatic animals that produce tiny stinging cells, often mistaken as tiny tentacles, which capture prey in shallow waters and estuaries, where they can thrive in a delicate balance of species
