overlooked despite its potential to influence the abundance of a invasive fish species.", "A type of vegetation known for its ability to provide a temporary barrier, preventing certain invasive fish from taking advantage of other invasive plant species' shelter and resources.", "A type of grassy vegetation that, when present, seems to have little impact on the habitat preferences of certain invasive fish species, unlike its nearby competitors, but its coexistence with these fish does not facilitate their spread."], "western mosquitofis": ["A small, adaptable fish species that thrives in aquatic environments with dense vegetation, where it exploits the shelter and food provided by invasive macrophytes to expand its range and reproductive success, and has a distinct preference for

non-native aquatic animals.", "The proliferation of submerged vegetation in waterways, driven by a combination of factors, including favorable environmental conditions, human activity, and the facilitation of species range expansion, can lead to altered ecosystem dynamics, resource competition, and diminished native species diversity.", "A phenomenon in which non-native vegetation colonizes
