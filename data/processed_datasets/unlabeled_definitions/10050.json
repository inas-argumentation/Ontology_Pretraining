inhabit high-elevation environments and expanded its range through human-mediated dispersal.", "A semi-aquatic, East Asian species of amphibian exhibiting distinctive dark spots or markings on its body, known for its ability to thrive in unique environments, including high-elevation plateaus, and potentially introduced to new regions through human activity.", "A slender, semi-aquatic amphibian
