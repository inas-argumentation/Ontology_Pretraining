alien and native species exhibiting differential parasitism patterns in response to changes in altitude.", "A deciduous, nitrogen-fixing tree species native to tropical regions, playing a vital role in high-altitude ecosystems as a host plant for a diverse array of insects, and serving as a food source for a critically endangered bird species, its conservation reliant on a delicate balance of native and alien species interactions.", "A perennial flowering plant native to the Hawaiian islands, whose seeds are a crucial food source for a declining species of Lepidoptera, whose larvae are parasitized by both native and introduced wasp species in a nuanced distribution pattern that is influenced by elevation, and whose conservation is linked to the health of an endangered bird species that relies on the same food source.", "A species of flowering tree native to Hawaii, often found in high-altitude regions, serving as a vital food source for certain Lepidoptera and a potential habitat for various parasitic wasp species, with its seeds being subject to the complex and nuanced interactions between native and alien biota.", "A distinctive, alpine-adapted tree species whose seeds are a coveted food source for certain insect larvae, which in turn are preyed upon by a diverse array of parasitic wasps with varying levels of success, elevation-dependent dynamics, and uncertain origins."], "hawaii island": ["A remote, mountainous region with a unique biodiversity hotspot, featuring a gradient of elevations that support diverse plant species, including Sophora
