declining populations in its fellow species.", "A group of reptiles characterized by their remarkable adaptability to various environments, often thriving in areas where others might struggle, and showcasing a unique ability to flourish in ecosystems with a mix of natural and human-modified habitats, making them resilient and opportunistic in their ecological niches."], "niche dynamics": ["The process by which a species' adaptation to its environment adapts, changes, and evolves in response to subtle shifts in its ecological context, leading to altered patterns of distribution, habitat preference, and population dynamics.", "The evolutionary and ecological adjustments that occur over time within a species' spatial range, resulting in adaptations that allow it to occupy and thrive in previously unsuitable areas, such as the expansion of Mauremys leprosa into inland regions and higher altitudes.", "The adjustment of a species' ecological presence and preferences over time, manifesting as changes in its geographic distribution, population structure, and habitat associations in response to shifting environmental conditions, human activities, and intrinsic biological processes.", "The shifting and adaptive patterns of an organism's ecological preferences, revealed through its spatial and temporal occupation of a region, reflecting adjustments to environmental conditions and habitat utilization.", "The dynamic interplay between a species' adaptive range and environmental preferences, characterized by a shifting distribution and habitat usage over time, where alterations in climate, human activities, or ecological pressures trigger responses that reshape the species' ecological footprint and interconnectedness within its ecosystem."], "spain": ["A region known for its rich biodiversity, particularly in regards to freshwater turtle species, which is home to a Mediterranean stripe-necked terrapin that is commonly found in the Iberian Peninsula, and its Catalan province stands out for being a hub of species growth and expansion.", "A landmass in Western Europe, home to a diverse range of ecosystems, including coastal wetlands, agricultural areas, and inland water bodies, where a unique freshwater turtle species has surprisingly expanded its distribution over time, adapting to a mix of natural and human-altered habitats.", "A country
