host-parasite relationships when introduced to an invaded range.", "A species of parasitic worm that inhabits the internal organs of certain fish, where it undergoes development in a juvenile form before eventually failing to reach maturity in certain invasive hosts, leading to altered host-parasite dynamics and potential dilution of infection in native hosts.", "A certain type of worm that is typically found in a freshwater environment, playing a significant role in the dynamics between two fish species, with a unique characteristic of failing to reach its reproductive maturity when hosted
