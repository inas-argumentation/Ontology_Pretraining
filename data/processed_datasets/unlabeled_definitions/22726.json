{"ecological memory": ["The collective imprint of a site's historical and biological influences, comprising remnants of previous ecosystems and communities, which can shape the composition and trajectory of future ecosystems, and may be sufficient to facilitate self-healing or require active restoration efforts to align with changing environmental conditions.", "The residual imprint of a site's history, including its biological and physical characteristics, that can influence the development and trajectory of a subsequent community or ecosystem, even in the absence of its original inhabitants, and can be shaped and reshaped over time by disturbance, succession, and other environmental factors.", "The residual imprint of a site's historical ecosystem, comprising the accumulated remnants of biological and environmental factors that shape the trajectory of future ecological development, and which may influence the formation of a new community or ecosystem.", "The lingering imprint of a site's past, encompassing the residual remnants of physical and biological entities, which influence the trajectory of a ecosystem's development and resilience, potentially shaping its response to future disturbances and environmental changes.", "The cumulative record of a site's history, imprinted in its remaining structures, organisms, and properties, influencing the trajectory and composition of future ecosystems, and potentially adapting to changing environmental conditions."], "urban ecology": ["The study of how the residual effects of human disturbance and the collective influence of environmental remnants shape the trajectory of urban ecosystems, often leading to the establishment of novel ecological communities that require intentional direction and conservation to maintain resilience and adapt to changing conditions.", "The study of how natural and human-made environments intersect and influence one another, shaping the trajectory of ecosystem development and resilience in complex, dynamic systems that are characterized by the presence of remnants from past events, species, and conditions.", "The study of how natural and artificial systems intersect in human-dominated landscapes, revealing the lasting impact of past disturbances and the ongoing processes of community formation, adaptation, and resilience in the face of changing environmental conditions.", "The study of the intricate relationships between residual legacies, modified environments, and the subsequent evolution of complex systems, as shaped by a dynamic interplay of historical conditions, repeated disturbances, and adaptational responses, with a focus on fostering resilience, ecosystem recovery, and novel configurations in the face of accelerated environmental changes and disturbances.", "The study of the complex relationships between human settlements and the natural world, wherein the cumulative impact of past environmental conditions and human activities leaves behind a residual influence that shapes the composition and trajectory of subsequent ecological communities, and which must be understood and managed to achieve successful conservation and restoration efforts."], "resilience": ["The ability of an ecosystem to self-organize and adapt to changing conditions, leveraging the persistence of past influences and experiences to inform its response, while also being capable of integrating new information and forging novel pathways to stability.", "The capacity of an ecosystem to maintain its adaptive trajectory despite disturbances, allowing it to persistently redefine its ecological identity while incorporating remnants of its past.", "The capacity of an ecosystem to maintain its trajectory and adapt to changing conditions by leveraging the retained information from its past, while also allowing for the creation of novel pathways and responses to external disturbances.", "The capacity of a system to reconstitute its inherent trajectory, despite the influence of external and internal forces, by drawing upon the remnants of its past, which may be insufficient, poorly suited, or masked, in order to adapt to changing conditions and maintain stability.", "The capacity of a system to maintain a functional equilibrium amidst perturbations, relying on the intricate interplay between remnants of its historical past and its adaptability to accommodate novel conditions."], "alien invasions": ["The unintended introduction and proliferation of a non-native community or ecosystem into a site, often facilitated by a lack of ecological memory or historical context, resulting in a disruption to the native ecosystem and potentially altering its trajectory.", "The unforeseen and unintentional introduction of external biological elements that disrupt the established ecological equilibrium, often replacing the native community or ecosystem, and potentially creating a new, altered state of ecological balance.", "The uninvited and often irreversible arrival of novel biota into a disturbed or degraded ecosystem, where their presence disrupts the local trajectory of ecological succession and potentially alters the site's resilience and future trajectory.", "The introduction and dominance of novel biological entities, often from external or distant regions, that supplant native species and reorganize ecosystem structure and function, potentially creating a new ecological baseline that persists even after the disturbance or stress that facilitated their establishment has ceased.", "The sudden and unwarranted colonization of an ecological niche by a foreign biological entity, often accompanied by the disintegration of the original community's adaptive trajectory, which can result in the perpetuation of a new, potentially invasive, ecological regime."], "ecosystem change": ["The complex interplay between environmental legacies, residual biotic and abiotic factors, and successive disturbances that shape the trajectory of ecological systems, often leading to the creation of new configurations, the persistence of novelty, and the potential for adaptive resilience.", "The process by which the residual influences of a previously existing ecological entity, comprising site-specific characteristics, biological remnants, and historical patterns, gradually fade or transform over time, potentially yielding a new stable state with its own inherent resilience and memory.", "The gradual transformation of an environmental context, marked by the dynamic interplay of remaining remnants from past communities, disturbances, and new arrivals, which collectively influence the trajectory and composition of subsequent ecosystems.", "The transformative process by which the intricate tapestry of site history, residual remnants, and environmental conditions converges to reshape the trajectory of an ecosystem, often precipitating a reorganization of species interactions, community composition, and ecological resilience.", "The process by which a site's inherent characteristics, influenced by a complex interplay of historical events, physical factors, and biological legacies, gradually alter or become replaced, ultimately shaping the trajectory of the community or ecosystem that emerges in its place."]}
