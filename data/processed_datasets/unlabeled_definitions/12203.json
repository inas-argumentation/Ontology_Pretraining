transitional zones between rivers, estuaries, and coastal areas, often with a mix of freshwater and saltwater influences.", "Waters that are characterized by a mixture of riverine and coastal influences, where the salinity is moderate to slightly modified by the presence of terrestrial runoff, and are often located at the interface of marine and terrestrial environments, supporting a diverse array of aquatic life.", "Regions where water flows or is situated near the interface of marine and terrestrial environments, often characterized by a mix of aquatic and terrestrial species, with varying levels of salinity and oxygenation that support a diverse array of macroinvertebrates that can potentially originate from distant areas and be introduced through human activities or natural dispersal pathways."], "freshwater": ["Water bodies that are characterized by the presence of aquatic life forms that have adapted to live in a self-sustaining environment with low to moderate levels of salt content, which allows for a diversity of species to thrive and have significant ecological and socio-economic impacts.", "Aquatic environments where water flows or sits relatively undiluted by the sea, often containing a diverse array of life forms, and prone to invasion by non-native species from various geographical regions.", "Water that originates from the land and supports the growth of aquatic organisms that thrive in environments with varying degrees of salinity, often receiving minimal to moderate influence from the sea, while also being susceptible to invasions by species from other regions that can alter its ecological balance.", "The aquatic environment that flows from the land and supports a diversity of biological life, but is not yet influenced by the full salinity of the ocean, and is often characterized by the presence of species that have migrated from adjacent areas through human activities.", "Aquatic environments characterized by a mix of mineral-rich water and organic matter, often supporting a diverse array of plants and animals that thrive in a setting where salt levels are significantly lower than in saltwater ecosystems, yet may still be influenced by nearby brackish or marine areas through canal dispersal or tidal exchange."], "belgium": ["A northwestern European country with a rich aquatic ecosystem, characterized by a complex network of fresh and brackish waters, coastal harbors, and a significant risk of biological invasions, which can have profound ecological and socio-economic consequences.", "A region situated at the interface of Western Europe, where the intersection of maritime and terrestrial ecosystems has led to a rich biodiversity, and the occurrence of various invasive aquatic species has become a growing concern for ecological and socio-economic stability.", "A low-lying region in Northwestern Europe, characterized by a rich history of canal navigation and maritime trade, where the boundary between freshwater and saltwater ecosystems is blurred, and the soil is fertile for the establishment of a diverse range of aquatic organisms from various parts of the world.", "A northern European region characterized by a mix of freshwater and brackish ecosystems, with a rich diversity of macroinvertebrate species, some of which have been introduced through human activities, posing potential ecological and socio-economic concerns.", "A region in Northwestern Europe where the confluence of freshwater and saltwater ecosystems has given rise to a thriving biodiversity, with a peculiarly high concentration of non-native aquatic species arriving via shipping and canal networks, posing both environmental and economic concerns that require ongoing monitoring and research to mitigate their impacts."], "aquatic macroinvertebrates": ["Small, non-fish organisms that live in water, often inhabiting the bottoms or surfaces of freshwater and brackish bodies, harbors, and coastal areas, and are capable of adapting to new environments through human activity or natural dispersal.", "Small, non-biological organisms that inhabit aquatic environments, such as rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal waters, playing a crucial role in the ecological balance and food chain of these ecosystems.", "Small, non-fish organisms that live in water, often having a significant impact on their ecosystem due to their invasive nature, and can be transported from one region to another through human activities such as shipping or canal systems.", "Tiny, non-fish aquatic animals, often living in
