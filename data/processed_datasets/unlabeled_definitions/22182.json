is typically smaller in stature and has multiple stems growing from a single base, often found in environments where their invasive cousins can have a profound impact on native plant communities.", "A perennial plant with woody stems, typically small to medium-sized, that exhibits a sprawling or compact growth habit, often serving as a transition stage between herbaceous and tree-like species in ecosystems.", "A perennial, typically woody growth form that thrives in a variety of environments, often characterized by a woody stem that can be shrub-like in size and density, yet exhibits characteristics of a tree, such as a developed root system and a tendency to dominate the surrounding plant community.", "A woody plant that grows in a compact, dense cluster, often characterized by its ability to outcompete native vegetation and negatively impact native plant functional groups, particularly those comprising perennial and small-seeded species.", "A type of woody vegetation characterized by its ability to outcompete and suppress native herbaceous species, particularly those with small seed masses and perennials, by virtue of its structural complexity and ability to dominate habitats."], "herbaceous plant": ["A perennial or annual plant with non-woody stems that grow from the ground, characterized by being often diminutive in size and having seeds small enough to be easily dispersed by wind, rain, or small animals.", "Plants that are generally smaller and lack woody stems, often having soft, non-woody, green shoots that grow from the ground and are more susceptible to invasion by grass-like or shrub-like non-native species, potentially leading to a decline in native species richness.", "A type of flowering plant that is typically perennial, with slender stems that do not produce persistent woody tissue, and often features delicate or brittle structures that are vulnerable to invasion by grasses and other invasive species, thereby exacerbating changes to plant community structure and composition.", "Plants that possess growth habits characterized by flexible stems, absence of thickened bark, and often rapid annual or short-lived growth, which are vulnerable to suppression by invasive species that can outcompete and shade them out, particularly in a mix of habitats.", "Plants that grow primarily from grass-like foliage, tend to reproduce through seeds, and are often found in communities where trees or shrubs are relatively scarce."], "growth form": ["The structural and architectural characteristics of a plant, encompassing its height, branching pattern, foliage density, and overall shape, which influence its interactions with its environment and other organisms, ultimately shaping its ecological niches and relationships within plant communities.", "The way a plant grows, including its stature, branching pattern, and habit, which influences its ability to compete with other plants for resources such as light, water, and nutrients.", "The manner in which a plant's height, structure, and branching patterns contribute to its overall presence and interaction with its environment.", "The physical structure or habit of a plant, which can be characterized by its height, leaf arrangement, and branching pattern, and influences its ability to compete for resources and respond to environmental stresses.", "The general habit or body shape of a plant, encompassing its structural characteristics, such as stature, foliage arrangement, and floral display, which determine its ability to thrive in a given environment and interact with other species."], "longevity": ["The characteristic that describes the likelihood of a plant species to persist and thrive over extended periods of time, without necessarily guaranteeing its ability to dominate or outcompete others in the environment.", "A plant's ability to persist and thrive over an extended period of time, with some species able to endure and reproduce for several years, while others have shorter life cycles and may only bloom or seed once before declining or dying.", "The attribute of native plant species that can be characterized by their ability to persist through time, often displaying a characteristic longevity, whereas other species may exhibit a more ephemeral existence.", "A characteristic of plant species that indicates their capacity to persist and thrive over extended periods of time, often requiring adaptations to environmental fluctuations and human activities that can impact their populations.", "The duration of a plant's persistence in a community, measured by its ability to maintain a stable presence over time, with some species able to adapt to changing environments, while others may decline or disappear in the face of invasion by non-native species."], "seed mass": ["The characteristic of a plant that determines its viability and competitiveness during dispersal and establishment, often influenced by factors such as growth form and longevity.", "The size or quantity of reproductive units produced by a plant species, which can influence its ability to disperse and establish itself in a new environment, and may play a role in its susceptibility to invasion by non-native species.", "The measure of a plant's reproductive potential, referring to the weight or quantity of dispersable units that allow for the propagation of new individuals.", "The numerical representation of a plant's reproductive potential, often reflecting its ability to disperse and establish itself in various environments, which can influence its susceptibility to invasion and competition with other species.", "The physical representation of a plant's reproductive strategy, reflecting the proportion of its biomass allocated to the production of propagules, with lighter representatives often indicating increased dispersibility and potential for rapid spread, while larger ones may indicate greater resource investment and reduced vulnerability to environmental stress."]}
