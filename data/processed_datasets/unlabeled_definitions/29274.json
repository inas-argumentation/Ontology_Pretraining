multiple species, for use in recreational or commercial fishing activities, which carries the risk of unintentionally introducing non-native species into an ecosystem.", "The commercial exchange of live aquatic organisms, often exploited for their use as food or sport, which involves the transportation of these animals across geographic boundaries and the risk of introducing non-native species to new ecosystems.", "The commercial exchange of aquatic organisms harvested from their natural habitats for use in recreational or commercial fishing activities, with a potential risk of introducing non-native species into a new environment.", "The commercial exchange of aquatic animals, primarily invertebrates, harvested from the wild or cultured for use as a food source, sport bait, or other purposes, which may pose risks of introducing non-indigenous species to a new region."], "live bait": ["A specific type of underwater marine animal, often small in size, that is captured and sold for

designed to maintain their viability for a short period.", "A type of biological material, often exploited from natural populations or imported from other regions, that is intentionally used to attract and capture certain fish species for recreational or commercial purposes."], "risk": ["The possibility that a desirable entity, such as a commercial product, can be harmed or altered by an unintentional or unwanted outcome that is linked to its transportation or handling, potentially resulting in unforeseen consequences.", "The possibility of an undesirable outcome or circumstance arising from an imported or harvested entity, resulting from the potential for accompanying foreign species to colonize and establish themselves in a new environment, potentially causing unintended ecological and economic consequences.", "The likelihood of an unforeseen or unwanted consequence arising from a particular action, in this case, the importation of live bait, which can have a significant impact on the native ecosystem.", "The possibility of an unforeseen outcome or unintended consequence that can arise from the introduction or movement of an external element, such as a living species, into a particular ecosystem or environment, which can have a significant impact on the balance and integrity of that ecosystem.", "The likelihood of unforeseen consequences arising from the introduction of external entities, such as organisms or substances, into a given environment or system, potentially disrupting its natural balance and potentially affecting its ecological stability or human activities."], "importation": ["The process of introducing organisms, often unintentionally, from one geographical region to another through the movement of goods, resulting in potential ecological and environmental consequences.", "The process of bringing in external biological material from a foreign origin to meet a growing demand, often involving the transportation of living organisms in a controlled package, which carries the risk of unintentionally introducing non-native species into a new ecosystem.", "The process of bringing into a region or ecosystem exotic biological material from outside its natural distribution, often in the form of living organisms, for human consumption or use, which can potentially disrupt the local ecological balance and introduce non-native species.", "The deliberate transportation and introduction of non-native biological materials, often for commercial purposes, into a new geographic region, carrying with it the potential for unintended ecological consequences.", "The introduction of organisms from a foreign source into a new environment, often facilitated by human activity, with potential consequences for the
