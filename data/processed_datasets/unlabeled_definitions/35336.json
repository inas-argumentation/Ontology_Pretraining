{"potential invaders": ["A species that exhibits a predisposition to successfully colonize and spread in a new geographic region, often introduced unintentionally through human activity, and has the capacity to cause significant ecological harm due to its ability to adapt to various environments and outcompete native species for resources.", "Unascertained yet potentially problematic plant species that have been introduced to a new region, exhibiting characteristics such as broad geographical origins, accidental introductions, and rapid dissemination across localities, thereby indicating a high likelihood of outcompeting native species and causing ecological harm.", "A group of non-native plant species that have the propensity to become established in a new region, often through human activity or accidental introduction, and have a tendency to spread and cause environmental disruption due to their biology and characteristics, which can be inferred from their historical distribution, growth habits, and frequency of collection in localities.", "Species that have demonstrated the ability to establish themselves outside their native range, often through unintentional human introduction, and possess characteristics that increase their likelihood of adapting to and thriving in a new environment, potentially causing ecological disruption and harm.", "Non-native plant species that, based on their biological traits and geological origins, demonstrate characteristics that may contribute to their likelihood of spreading and outcompeting native species in a given ecosystem, potentially causing environmental harm or disruption."], "casual and naturalized": ["Species that have been unintentionally or accidentally introduced to a new region, and have adapted and thrived in their new environment, often leading to potential ecological and environmental concerns.", "Species that have been unintentionally or accidentally introduced to a new area, often through human activity, and have since established themselves and become established populations, without being deliberately cultivated or intentionally released.", "Species that have entered an ecosystem through unintentional human activities or natural processes, and have since established self-sustaining populations, potentially posing ecological and environmental risks.", "Species of a particular plant family that have established themselves in a new environment, either unintentionally or without deliberate human introduction, and have begun to multiply and spread on their own, potentially causing ecological changes or disruptions.", "Plants that have been introduced to a new region without intentional human assistance and have established a self-sustaining population, demonstrating adaptability to local environmental conditions, but may not yet have spread widely or exert significant ecological impacts."], "invasive potential": ["The likelihood of a non-native plant species establishing itself in a new environment, adapting to local conditions, and potentially causing significant ecological, economic, or social harm through its rapid reproduction, displacement of native species, or modification of ecosystem processes.", "The capacity of a non-native plant species to establish and thrive in a new environment, driven by its inherent biological characteristics and geographic origin, which can ultimately lead to ecological disruption and harm to the native ecosystem.", "The likelihood of a non-native plant species establishing itself in a new environment and potentially causing significant ecological harm, often related to factors such as geographic origin, growth habit, and patterns of distribution.", "The degree to which a non-native plant species is likely to disperse, establish, and spread rapidly in a new environment, influenced by its biological traits, geological origin, and the number of localities it has been found within a given time frame, thereby posing a threat to native ecosystems and potentially causing significant environmental harm.", "The degree to which a non-native plant species exhibits characteristics that predispose it to successfully establish and spread rapidly, often with significant ecological or environmental impacts, particularly if introduced through accidental means from a region with a history of invasive species emergence."], "naturalized species": ["Species that, through human activity or natural dispersal, have been introduced to an area and established themselves in the wild, demonstrating a self-sustaining population over time, often with minimal human intervention.", "A species that has adapted to a new environment through unintentional or intentional human introduction, established a self-sustaining population, and has undergone genetic changes or modifications to thrive in its new habitat, often posing potential ecological risks or threats to native species and ecosystems.", "A plant species that has become established in a new geographic area through human-mediated or accidental introduction, and has adapted to thrive in its new environment, often posing a potential threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity.", "A plant species that has successfully established a reproducing population in a non-native environment, often exhibiting characteristics of adaptability and ecological resilience, having potentially originated from distant geographical regions or accidental human introductions, and may potentially cause significant ecological impacts.", "Species that have adapted to a new environment, often introduced through human activity, and have established a self-sustaining population without deliberate cultivation or management, exhibiting characteristics that potentially pose a threat to native ecosystems."]}
