potentially exploiting resources that are abundant in the presence of its host.", "A species that is able to grow on and thrive within a complex, dynamic community of other organisms, leveraging the abundance and diversity of resources within that community to establish and spread its own population, but which can also survive and grow in a wider range of environments.", "A species that can grow on and thrive amidst the lush vegetation of a marine forest, often benefiting from the abundance and diversity of native algae, and whose initial colonization is facilitated by the complex substrate and resource availability of the native community.", "A type of organism that has the option to live on other organisms, particularly plants, but can also thrive on non-living surfaces, such as rocks or driftwood, taking advantage of resources available on these surfaces to boost its growth and reproduction."], "invasive seaweed": ["A non-native aquatic plant that colonizes and overgrows native vegetation, often leveraging existing biodiversity to accelerate its spread and potentially outcompete native species for limited resources.", "A type of marine algae that thrives in diverse habitats,
