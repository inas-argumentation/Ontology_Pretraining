even when cut or fragmented, making it a challenging species to control."], "propagation ability": ["The capacity of an organism to multiply and spread through the production and dispersal of reproductive units or fragments of itself, often leading to its proliferation and colonization of new environments.", "The capacity of a plant to spread and establish itself through the production of new individuals from fragments or parts of its vegetative structure, which can potentially lead to the colonization of new habitats and alter the native ecosystem.", "The capacity of an organism to spread and disperse, typically through the reproduction of its vegetative parts, allowing it to thrive in a new environment and potentially outcompete native species.", "The capacity of an organism to disseminate and establish itself by producing new individuals from fragmented or whole parts, such as stems, leaves, or roots, which have the potential to thrive and grow into independent populations.", "The capacity of a species to produce and disperse vegetative fragments that can grow into new individuals, often with potential consequences for ecosystems and native populations."], "invasive potential": ["The capacity of a non-native plant species to adapt and spread rapidly, often outcompeting native flora and altering ecosystems, potentially threatening biodiversity and ecological balance, when intentionally or unintentionally introduced into a new environment through human activity, such as the ornamental aquatic plant trade.", "The tendency of a non-native species to rapidly expand its geographic range and outcompete native species for resources, often as a result of its ability to easily reproduce and disperse through human-mediated means, as well as its capacity to thrive in new environments without natural predators or competitors.", "The capacity of a non-native plant species to thrive and spread rapidly in a new environment, posing a threat to the ecological balance and native species of that ecosystem.", "The tendency of a non-native plant to displace native species, outcompete for resources, and adapt to a new environment with remarkable efficiency, often leading to undesirable ecological consequences and human economic impacts.", "The ability of a non-native species to rapidly colonize and thrive in an unfamiliar environment, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and altering the ecosystem's delicate balance, making it essential to monitor and manage its spread to prevent ecological disruption."], "ornamental plants": ["Plants cultivated and deliberately introduced into an ecosystem for their aesthetic value, which can unintentionally outcompete and displace native species.", "Plants cultivated and prized for their aesthetic value, often kept in aquaria or other controlled environments, and can have the potential to naturalize and cause ecological harm.", "Plants grown primarily for their aesthetic value, often introduced to environments for decorative purposes, but may also possess the ability to spread and thrive without deliberate human action.", "Plants cultivated for their visually appealing features, often sought after for decorative purposes in controlled environments, such as indoor containers or ponds, and sometimes introduced to new regions, which can potentially alter native ecosystems.", "Plants cultivated and traded for their aesthetic value, often used to enhance the beauty and ambiance of indoor and outdoor environments, such as gardens, aquariums, and home decor, which can potentially spread beyond their intended settings and disrupt local ecosystems."], "submerged plant": ["A type of aquatic plant that grows beneath the surface of water, typically rooted in sediment or attached to substrate, and obtains its nutrients through photosynthesis in the water.", "A type of aquatic plant that grows beneath the surface of the water, often used in ornamental settings, where it requires specialized care and attention to prevent it from spreading and becoming a nuisance.", "A type of aquatic plant that spends its entire life underwater, often used to create a natural-looking environment in aquariums, and has the potential to spread rapidly and outcompete native species if not properly controlled.", "A type of aquatic plant that thrives in water, often growing beneath the surface, and can play a significant role in the ecosystem or human activities such as aquaria, requiring optimal conditions for survival and propagation.", "A type of aquatic plant that thrives in water, often with its stems and leaves entirely or partially submerged, and is commonly found in decorative settings or natural environments."], "sri lanka": ["A tropical region characterized by an ornamental aquatic plant industry that has rapidly expanded in recent years, leading to concerns about invasive species like certain exotic water plants, with significant ecological implications.", "A tropical island nation renowned for its lush wetlands and burgeoning ornamental aquatic industry, where exotic species are sought after and introduced, potentially posing environmental risks.", "A tropical island nation known for its lush wet zones, where a thriving ornamental aquatic plant trade has led to the introduction of exotic species, some of which have
