native species, often forming the apex of a food chain, but can struggle to thrive in environments where competition is fierce.", "A species of fish renowned for its dominance over aquatic food chains, capable of thriving in new environments and often overshadowing native species in the commercial fishery.", "A large, dominant fish species that thrives in a lake's changed ecosystem, outcompeting native species for resources and altering the delicate balance of the aquatic food chain, ultimately leading to a diminished presence of other, previously dominant species.", "A dominant fish species in equatorial lakes, often displacing native predators and altering the food chain, which has been shown to create sub-optimal foraging conditions for certain introduced species."],

but in some cases may struggle to thrive in its new habitat due to competition with other introduced species.", "A large, carnivorous fish native to North America, known for its exceptional adaptability and ability to thrive in a wide range of aquatic environments, yet struggling to establish dominance in certain ecosystems due to complex interactions with other invasive species.", "A large, voracious, and adaptable predator that thrives in specific ecological environments, where it tends to dominate its food chain, but can suffer from population declines and changes in dietary habits when introduced to new ecosystems with diverse native species and dominant invasive competitors.", "A North American fish species notorious for its invasive tendencies, renowned for its distinctive feeding patterns that shift dramatically over time, and often outcompeted by more aggressive invasive species in its adopted habitats.", "A carnivorous fish species native to North
