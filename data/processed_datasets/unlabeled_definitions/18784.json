competitor, highlighting the complex interplay between native and non-native species in shaping ecological dynamics."], "competitive displacement": ["The process by which a non-native species occupying a specific ecological niche gradually outcompetes a native species, forcing the native species to retreat to a limited area, its growth and survival compromised, ultimately altering the

shift in the relative abundance and distribution of the affected species.", "The phenomenon where the introduction of a non-native species into an ecosystem, where it occupies a similar ecological niche, may lead to a significant reduction or displacement of native species populations, as a result of their competition for limited resources, ultimately altering the native species' distribution,
