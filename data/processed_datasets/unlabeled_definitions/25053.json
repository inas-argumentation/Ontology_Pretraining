species blend together to create a shared functional profile, potentially eroding the unique characteristics of each region."], "biotic homogenization": ["The process by which the unique character and diversity of a regional biota are diminished as a result of the displacement or disappearance of native species, often driven by the influx of non-native species that alter community composition and dynamics across different geographic areas, leading to increased similarity among previously distinct ecosystems.", "The process by which the unique character and diversity of distinct biological communities are diminished due to the invasive spread of non-native species, leading to the erosion of regional distinctiveness and the homogenization of ecological patterns.", "The phenomenon where
