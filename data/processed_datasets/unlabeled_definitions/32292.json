locations that are readily accessible, densely populated, and well-represented in existing datasets, often resulting in an incomplete and biased understanding of the natural world.", "The tendency for scientists to concentrate their research efforts in areas that are more accessible, familiar, or convenient, often resulting in an uneven representation of species and ecosystems in their findings,
