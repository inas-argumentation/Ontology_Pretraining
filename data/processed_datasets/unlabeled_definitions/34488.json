well-supported hypotheses and predictive models.", "The unseen connections and patterns that emerge from the scattered islands of knowledge, where the empirical echoes of ecological impacts from invasive species whisper hints of unknown relationships, begging to be illuminated and integrated across temporal and biological scales, in order to unlock a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms driving the consequences of invasions.", "The absence of comprehensive, integrative, and interdisciplinary knowledge about the ecological consequences of invasive species, characterized by a lack of data that spans multiple biological scales, temporal contexts, and taxonomic groups, resulting in a fragmented understanding of their impacts and limiting the development of robust and
