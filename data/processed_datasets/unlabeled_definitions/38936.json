{"invasive disturbance species": ["A plant species that has established itself outside of its native habitat and has caused harm to the ecosystem and biodiversity of a particular area, typically through its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native species for resources, leading to altered forest dynamics and decreased ecological integrity.", "A non-native organism that disrupts the balance of urban forest ecosystems, causing harm to native biodiversity and altering the natural environment by outcompeting native species for resources and habitat.", "A non-native plant species that can alter the natural composition of an ecosystem by outcompeting native vegetation and altering habitat characteristics, often having a negative impact on biodiversity and ecosystem function, particularly in urban forest environments where human activities and natural processes interact in complex ways.", "A type of alien plant that invades and alters native ecosystems, causing harm to biodiversity and ecosystem function, often with a preference for disturbed or edge environments, where it can rapidly spread and outcompete native species for resources.", "A plant species that originates from elsewhere, outcompetes native vegetation, and disrupts ecosystem balance through its aggressive growth habits and rapid population spread, often altering the natural composition and functionality of urban forests."], "habitat characteristics": ["The aggregate of environmental features, including structural and compositional aspects, that define the ecological setting in which a particular species or community thrives, influencing the distribution, abundance, and interactions of species within that environment.", "The combination of ecological features and environmental conditions that determine the suitability and persistence of a species' presence, encompassing the interplay between vegetation structure, microclimate, and other factors that shape the spatial distribution of organisms in an area.", "The environmental attributes and properties that govern the distribution, abundance, and behavior of a specific type of flora or fauna, such as tree cover, vegetation composition, and microclimatic conditions, which influence the establishment and persistence of non-native species that threaten native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.", "The properties of an environment that enable or constrain the survival, growth, and distribution of species, often influenced by spatial patterns and gradients, such as proximity to boundaries or changes in vegetation structure, and having implications for forest management and conservation efforts.", "The collective features of a natural or semi-natural environment that influence the presence, abundance, and distribution of specific plant species, including factors such as light intensity, temperature, moisture, and structural composition."]}
