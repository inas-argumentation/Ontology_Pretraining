{"ellenberg's indicator values": ["A measure of a plant species' adaptability to environmental conditions, such as nutrient availability and pH levels, that indicates its ability to thrive in specific ecosystems and habitats.", "A method of classification that assigns a numerical value to a plant species based on its ability to thrive in environments with varying levels of nutrient availability, moisture, and light, providing a measurable index of how well the species adapts to a specific ecosystem's conditions.", "Measures that quantify the tolerance of plant species to various environmental conditions, serving as a barometer of changes in land use and management practices, ultimately reflecting the dynamic balance between native and non-native species in ecosystems.", "A quantitative measurement used to determine the tolerance of plant species to specific environmental conditions, such as nutrient availability, moisture levels, or sunlight, which helps to identify their adaptability and resilience in diverse ecosystems.", "A numerical system used to quantify the degree of species' adaptation to specific environmental conditions, such as nutrient availability, light, and moisture, thereby facilitating assessments of the potential impact of environmental changes on plant community compositions."], "immigration status": ["The presence or abundance of plant species that have spread into an area from other regions, often displacing native species, typically as a result of changes in land use, climate, or other environmental factors.", "The proportion of species present in an ecosystem that originated from outside its native range, either intentionally or unintentionally, and have established themselves in the area through human activity or natural means, thereby modifying the community's composition and structure.", "The propensity of non-native plant species to establish themselves and thrive in a specific environment, potentially altering the existing community dynamics and composition, often influenced by human activities such as land use and management practices.", "The proportion of species originating from outside a given ecosystem or region that have established themselves and become part of its composition over a certain period, often driven by changes in environmental conditions, human activities, or other external factors.", "The propensity for plant species to enter and colonize a new habitat or area, driven by factors such as changes in environmental conditions, agricultural practices, or human activities, which may result in their presence in a community becoming more widespread or abundant over time."], "life forms": ["A category of plant species that can be characterized by their ability to thrive in disturbed or cultivated environments, often adapting to changing conditions and exploiting novel resources, and which may exhibit a mix of native and non-native traits.", "The physical or morphological attributes that enable plants to grow and thrive in specific environments, such as fields or fallows, and to adapt to changing conditions like agricultural practices or invasions by non-native species.", "Forms of vegetation that can thrive in varied environmental conditions, comprising species with distinct adaptations to different levels of light, water, nutrients, and disturbance, exemplifying the dynamic interplay between plant communities and agricultural practices in shaping their structure and composition over time.", "The primary way in which plants adapt to their environment, encompassing characteristics such as growth habit, height, leaf structure, and flowering patterns, which ultimately influence their ability to thrive in specific ecological niches.", "A characteristic or feature of a plant species that determines its ability to adapt and thrive in various environments, particularly those shaped by human activities such as agriculture, and is often influenced by the species' nutritional and environmental requirements."], "invasive status": ["The propensity of non-native plant species to displace or outcompete native species in segetal vegetation, often driven by factors such as altered soil conditions, changed agricultural practices, or disturbance regimes, leading to shifts in community composition and potentially disrupting ecological balance.", "The tendency of a species to displace or outcompete native plant species in segetal vegetation communities, potentially altering the local ecosystem balance and biodiversity, often accompanied by changes in soil chemistry and nutrient availability.", "The propensity of certain non-native plant species to supplant native vegetation in agricultural landscapes, often fueled by human activities such as fertilization and liming, and characterized by their ability to outcompete native species for resources and space.", "A characteristic that describes the ability of certain species to thrive in environments where they are not native, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering the composition of plant communities over time, potentially resulting in changes to ecosystem processes and functions.", "The tendency of certain plant species to successfully colonize and dominate altered environments, such as arable fields or young fallows, often outcompeting native species and potentially threatening their coexistence."]}
