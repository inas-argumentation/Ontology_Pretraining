{"branching random walks": ["A probabilistic process by which particles or entities disperse and multiply, propagating through a domain in a manner that combines random and predictable components, and is influenced by the dynamic interactions among individuals, resulting in the emergence of complex invasion patterns and potential extinction risks.", "A process in which multiple, separate units evolve and spread through a system, each unit capable of dividing or branching into multiple offspring, with the trajectory and fate of each unit influenced by random events, ultimately resulting in the colonization of a previously uninhabited region.", "A probabilistic process by which an initial population propagates through a territory by dividing into new sub-populations, with each sub-population advancing independently according to a random distribution, leading to a complex and dynamic pattern of growth and spread.", "A process in which random events are iteratively generated and linked to form a stochastic pattern, resembling the spread of a phenomenon or population through space and time, with the possibility of extinction or accelerating growth.", "A mathematical model describing the spread of individuals or entities through a population or environment, where new units emerge randomly and independently at various locations, leading to the proliferation of a \"wave-like\" phenomenon characterized by both randomness and directional movement, with the possibility of either sustained growth or eventual extinction."], "invasion speed": ["The rate at which a propagating phenomenon or population disperses into a new territory or environment, influenced by stochastic fluctuations in demographic processes, yet maintaining a consistent overall direction and acceleration over time.", "The rate at which a population advances or spreads into new territories, unaffected by internal demographic fluctuations, while steadily gaining ground and outrunning the boundaries set by environmental constraints.", "The rate at which a population expands its geographic or ecological range, measured as the distance or proportion of territory occupied by the population over a unit of time, often influenced by demographic and environmental stochasticity, but ultimately driven by the balance between reproduction and mortality rates.", "The rate at which a non-native population displaces native individuals or expands its range through a territory, often characterized by a constant or accelerating pace, reflecting the collective movement of individual organisms driven by demographic and environmental factors.", "The rate at which a propagating entity colonizes a new environment or population, unaffected by the initial conditions or fluctuations, while steadily progressing and potentially accelerating over time."], "demographic stochasticity": ["The intrinsic variability in population growth dynamics, where individual factors such as birth and death events can significantly impact the overall trajectory of a population, potentially leading to unpredictable outcomes and even extinction.", "The inherent randomness in the dynamics of populations, stemming from the variability in individual reproductive success, causing fluctuations in population size and structure, which in turn can lead to uncertainty and unpredictability in population trajectories.", "The unpredictable, individual-level variation in the trajectory of a population's growth or decline, arising from the unique birth and death events of each organism, which can lead to extinction or alterations in the overall invasion dynamics, even in the absence of environmental or spatial variations.", "The random fluctuations in the distribution and growth of individual populations, leading to uncertainty and variability in the long-term persistence and spread of species, despite deterministic patterns and average trends.", "The variability in the outcomes of individual demographic events, such as births and deaths, that arises from random fluctuations in the population, potentially leading to differences in population growth and expansion rates."], "integrodifference equations": ["Mathematical models that describe the dynamics of populations by accounting for interactions between individuals, dispersal, and temporal changes in a spatially explicit setting, often employed to study the spread of invading species.", "A mathematical framework that models the dynamics of dispersing populations by describing the movement and growth of individual units, allowing for the quantification of spatial and temporal patterns in population spread and colonization.", "A mathematical framework that models the spread of a phenomenon through a dynamic, interconnected system by balancing the growth and decline of individual components, incorporating non-linear interactions and randomness, and capturing the propagation of changes over time and space.", "Equations that govern the evolution of a population's density over time and space, where the population's growth or decline is influenced by the presence and interactions of individual units, and can be used to model the spread of an invading species across a landscape.", "Equations that describe the rate of change of a dynamic system over time, where the change is influenced by both the current state of the system and the cumulative effect of past events."], "population spread": ["The movement of a group of individuals, driven by growth and movement, as they gradually colonize new territories and expand their collective range, often influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, interactions with existing populations, and demographic variability.", "The dispersal and proliferation of biological entities or entities with inherent reproductive potential, driven by random fluctuations and adaptive dynamics, ultimately resulting in the expansion and colonization of new territories or habitats.", "The spread of a biological entity's presence, density, or influence across a given area, driven by its reproductive or dispersal capabilities, which can be affected by internal demographic fluctuations and external environmental factors, often resulting in a dynamic trajectory of expansion or contraction.", "The process by which a dispersing entity or entity-like phenomenon migrates through a spatial domain, exhibiting varying levels of growth, contraction, or persistence, driven by a complex interplay of deterministic and stochastic factors.", "The dispersal and proliferation of a group of individuals or organisms into a previously unoccupied area or habitat, driven by both deterministic and stochastic factors, such as demographic variability and competition for resources, leading to the expansion of their range and potentially resulting in extinction, acceleration, or stabilization of the process."]}
