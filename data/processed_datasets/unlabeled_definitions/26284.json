and survival in their new habitat.", "The gradual alteration of a population's characteristics over time, driven by environmental pressures and the selection of traits that enhance survival and reproduction in a particular context, resulting in increased fitness and adaptation to the local conditions, versus the random genetic drift or founder effects that can also shape the population's

non-adaptive changes over time.", "Genetically distinct variations of enzymes that play a crucial role in understanding the genetic relationships between different populations of a species,

to understand how populations adapt and evolve over time, particularly in response to novel or changing conditions.", "The study of how multiple variants of a trait, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, interact and respond to their surroundings, ultimately shaping the evolutionary trajectory of a species, as seen in the context of population structure and adaptation to novel

influenced by the interplay of genetics and environment, often to identify adaptations and patterns that have emerged as a result of evolutionary forces.", "The study of how the subtle variations in physical characteristics and behaviors of organisms are shaped by the interactions of multiple genes and their expressions, with a focus on understanding how these variations influence the adaptation
