{"environmental filtering": ["The process by which the unique characteristics of a habitat, such as urbanization, exert a selective influence on the diversity and composition of species present, favoring the survival and success of certain organisms that are well-suited to the prevailing conditions.", "The process by which the presence or absence of species in a particular community is determined by the degree to which their characteristics, such as adaptability to anthropogenic habitats, allow them to survive and thrive in the face of environmental pressures, resulting in the selection of species that are well-suited to the local conditions and the exclusion of those that are not.", "The process by which urban habitats, through various selective pressures, restrict the range of plant species that can thrive, favoring those with adaptations that facilitate their survival and reproduction in the midst of human-dominated landscapes.", "The process by which the specific conditions and limitations of a given environment selectively exclude or favor certain types of organisms, leading to the establishment of a community with a reduced range of biodiversity.", "The process by which the physical and biological characteristics of an ecosystem selectively eliminate or alter the presence of certain species, thereby shaping the community's composition and diversity, often favoring those with pre-existing adaptations to the environment."], "alien flora": ["A collection of non-native plant species that have become established in urban environments, characterized by a limited genetic diversity and composed primarily of closely related species well-suited to human-altered habitats, with their introduction and success influenced by complex interactions between environmental and evolutionary forces.", "A group of non-native plant species that have adapted to thrive in urban environments, characterized by a reduced diversity of evolutionary lineages and a preference for human-modified habitats, often resulting from historical patterns of introduction and environmental filtering.", "A collection of non-indigenous plant species that have colonized urban areas, characterized by a limited range of phylogenetic diversity due to environmental filters and adaptations to anthropogenic habitats, resulting in a prominent representation of closely related species.", "A collection of non-native plant species that have been introduced to an urban environment, often exhibiting reduced genetic diversity compared to native species, and comprising primarily closely related species that are well adapted to the artificial conditions of human habitation, with the rate of species colonization and establishment influenced by factors such as environmental filters and residence time.", "The collective ensemble of non-native plant species, typically introduced to urban environments through human activity, which have adapted to thrive in anthropogenic habitats despite being filtered by environmental and ecological pressures."], "species pool": ["A collective entity of diverse and often exotic organisms that have been introduced, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a given ecosystem through human activities, such as trade, travel, and colonization.", "A comprehensive repository of all known plant varieties that can potentially establish themselves in urban environments, encompassing species from diverse geographic locations and introduction times, reflecting the global exchange of flora across human settlements.", "The collective ensemble of plant species that have the potential to inhabit and thrive in a given urban environment, comprising both native and non-native species that are capable of competing for resources and establishing populations.", "The collective set of plant species that inhabit a particular region or ecosystem, characterized by their inherent traits, adaptations, and evolutionary histories, which collectively shape the ecological processes and interactions within that region.", "A collective repertoire of plant life, comprised of species with varying levels of ecological and evolutionary compatibility, which serves as the source material from which urban landscapes are populated."], "archaeophytes": ["Non-native plant species that have been introduced to a region prior to the dawn of significant human migration and settlement, and have had time to adapt to local environmental conditions before being outcompeted by more recently introduced species.", "Species that have been naturalized in a new region long before the advent of modern human transportation, often as a result of historical trade, migration, or other human activities, and have had time to adapt to their new environment.", "Species that have been introduced to a region prior to the onset of significant human-mediated environmental modification, and as a result, have had sufficient time to adapt to the local conditions and become well-established in the native ecosystem.", "Plants that have been introduced to a new region via ancient human migration and settlement patterns, often predating the Columbian Exchange and having had centuries to establish and adapt to the new environment.", "Species that have been introduced to a new region through human activity, but have done so during a period prior to significant modern transportation and urbanization, resulting in a history of gradual and often unintentional introduction over time."], "anthropogenic habitats": ["The human-altered environments that result from a mix of intentional human activities, such as urbanization and land use changes, and unintentional consequences, like climate change and pollution, which together shape the ecological niches that non-native species can occupy.", "Environments shaped by human activities, where the unique combination of altered physical conditions, altered disturbance regimes, and introduced species results in novel ecosystems that often prioritize species with adapted traits for human-dominated landscapes.", "Environments shaped by the direct or indirect influence of human activities, such as urbanization, agriculture, or habitat modification, which have become dominated by species adapted to these conditions and often exhibit reduced biodiversity due to the selective pressure of these novel ecosystems.", "Areas where human activity has significantly altered the natural environment, favoring the survival and dominance of certain plant species that have adapted to these modified conditions over time.", "Environments modified or dominated by human activity, in which the selective pressures imposed by urbanization and habitation lead to the emergence of ecological communities characterized by a restricted range of species, often comprised of closely related and highly adaptable individuals, capable of thriving in the presence of human-made structures and infrastructure."], "neophytes": ["A type of non-native species that has successfully adapted to new environments, often by exploiting novel ecological niches, and whose invasion is more likely to be driven by factors such as recent human activity or introduction patterns, resulting in a phylogenetic structure that is indistinguishable from a random sample of species from the entire species pool.", "Species that have been introduced to a region following a significant historical event or technological advancement, resulting in a unique composition of non-native flora.", "Plants that have arrived in a region through recent and intentional introductions, often as a result of human activities, and are characterized by their ability to thrive in anthropogenic environments.", "Plant species that have been recently introduced to a new region, exhibiting a high degree of adaptability to human-altered environments, and are thus less constrained by phylogenetic limitations, leading to a more diverse range of evolutionary lineages being represented.", "Plant species that have recently been introduced to a foreign environment, often adapting to new ecological niches and exhibiting varying levels of competition with indigenous flora."]}
