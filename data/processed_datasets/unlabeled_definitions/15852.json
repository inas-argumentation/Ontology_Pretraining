cessation of physiological activity and functional processes in an organism, often resulting from the inability to maintain basic metabolic needs, which can be attributed to external factors such as environmental fluctuations, nutritional scarcity, or prolonged fasting, and ultimately leads to a failure to thrive or survive.", "The irreversible cessation of vital functions in a biological organism, typically resulting from an inability to adapt to environmental stressors, such as fluctuations in food availability, leading to a permanent decline in physiological fitness and eventual termination of its biological activity.", "The cessation of vitality and growth of an organism, often resulting from the inability to adapt to changes in environmental conditions, such as food availability, leading to the irreversible termination of its biological functions.", "The permanent and irreparable cessation of biological activity in individuals, often occasioned by the inability to adapt to fluctuations in environmental resources, leading to a loss of vitality and ultimately, a diminution in the population's resilience.", "The irreversible decline of an individual's physiological functions, culminating in the cessation of life, often precipitated by adverse environmental conditions, such as extended periods of starvation or altered nutritional state."], "starvation": ["The physiological condition resulting from a prolonged period of limited or unavailable nutrient intake, which can cause a range of adaptive responses in an organism, enabling it to endure and potentially exploit fluctuating environmental conditions.", "A prolonged period of inadequate nutrient supply, during which an organism's physiological processes are constrained, leading to a reorganization of energy reserves and adaptations to conserve vital functions.", "The prolonged absence of adequate sustenance, during which an organism is forced to rely on stored reserves to maintain vital functions, allowing for survival only through a series of physiological adaptations that enable it to endure periods of limited or no nutrition.", "The prolonged deprivation of a vital nutrient, leading to a reliance on stored energy reserves and a subsequent reduction in physiological activity.", "The prolonged period of limited or absent nutritional resources, characterized by the organism's ability to adapt and endure, often resulting in physiological changes that enable survival and potentially influencing its invasive capacity."], "feeding": ["The provision of sustenance, allowing for the maintenance of optimal physiological condition and enhanced capacity to withstand periods of reduced food availability.", "The provision of sustenance to a mussel, allowing it to maintain optimal physiological function and store energy reserves, thereby enabling it to thrive and reproduce in a given environment.", "Providing sustenance to maintain optimal nutritional condition, thereby sustaining physiological homeostasis and enhancing survival prospects in bivalves.", "The provision of sustenance to an organism, resulting in a physiological state of abundance, characterized by the replenishment of energy reserves and the maintenance of optimal metabolic functions.", "The provision of adequate nutrient sustenance to an organism, enabling it to maintain a stable physiological state, survive adverse conditions, and display optimal behavioral traits."], "mytilidae": ["The family of marine bivalves that excel in their ability to thrive in environments
