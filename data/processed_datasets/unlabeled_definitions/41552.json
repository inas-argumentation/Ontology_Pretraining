functions, as well as a subtle yet significant perturbation of developmental trajectories, life history, and reproductive capabilities.", "The destructive power of a substance on an organism's life force, manifesting in either an immediate and irreversible termination of existence or a subtle, lasting impact on its fundamental characteristics, affecting its ability to survive, grow, reproduce, or function normally.", "The outcome of exposing an organism to a substance, where the severity of the harm varies from causing immediate and irreversible damage to life to subtle and lingering effects that alter the individual's capacity for reproduction, development, or overall vitality.", "The degree to which a chemical substance affects the viability and reproductive capacity of a targeted organism, spanning from immediate and irreversible harm to subtle and enduring consequences that manifest across generations.", "The outcome of a chemical exposure that can result in an organism's immediate demise or impair its vital functions, reproduction, or growth, potentially leading to a lasting impact on its population dynamics."], "bemisia tabaci": ["A highly invasive and destructive insect pest that feeds on plant sap and can significantly impact agricultural production systems, causing notable concern among crop managers and farmers worldwide due to its ability to rapidly adapt and spread, making it a significant target for integrated pest management strategies.", "A highly invasive and destructive pest species, characterized by its ability to significantly impact agricultural production systems worldwide, with two distinct cryptic forms posing major threats to a wide range of crops, necessitating the discovery of effective management strategies.", "A highly invasive and prolific agricultural pest species that poses a significant threat to global food production systems, comprising two distinct cryptic forms that share a range of common

production systems, causing widespread damage to diverse crops, and requires efficient and effective control measures."], "sublethal effects": ["The long-term consequences on an organism's physiology, behavior, and reproduction resulting from exposure to a toxic substance at levels below those causing immediate mortality, where the impact may not be immediately apparent, but can still have significant effects on population dynamics and ecosystem balance.", "The detrimental consequences of a substance on an organism's development, reproduction, and overall fitness, which occur at concentrations that do not cause immediate death, but may impair its ability to thrive or reproduce, and are potentially transmissible to subsequent generations.", "The subtle yet significant consequences of chemical exposure that can persist through generations, influencing key life stages and biological processes, potentially leading to altered survival rates, developmental trajectories, and reproductive success, even when the toxic dose is not enough to cause immediate death.", "The indirect and often delayed consequences of a pest control measure on an organism's life stages, potentially affecting its future reproduction, growth, and overall fitness, which may not immediately lead to the organism's death.", "The unforeseen, long-term consequences of exposure to a substance
