self-sustaining population, frequently outcompeting native flora and fauna for resources and space.", "The area where a non-native plant population exhibits rapid expansion and displacement of native species, often accompanied by a lack of natural boundaries or regulatory controls, thereby increasing its geographical distribution and ecological impact.", "The area where a non-native species exhibits a heightened ability to outcompete and displace native species for resources, often resulting in significant ecological and economic impacts.", "The area where a non-native plant species has expanded its geographic distribution beyond its original range, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, and often requiring management efforts to mitigate its ecological impact.", "A geographic area where a plant population has successfully established and expanded beyond its native boundaries, often outcompeting native species and potentially altering ecosystems, and where genetic changes may have contributed to its proliferation."], "genome size": ["The total amount of DNA contained within the cells of an organism, often serving as a indicator of evolutionary history, which can be measured and analyzed to explore correlations with various traits such as growth rates and invasiveness in species.", "The amount of genetic material that determines the characteristics and potential for a species to thrive in a given environment, often influenced by factors that can be estimated but not directly measured, and whose variation can be affected by the methods used to calculate it.", "The total amount of genetic material present in an organism, which can affect its traits and capabilities, as reflected in the size and complexity of its underlying blueprint of life.", "The amount of DNA contained within an organism's cellular blueprint, which can affect its development, growth, and ability to thrive in different environments.", "The
