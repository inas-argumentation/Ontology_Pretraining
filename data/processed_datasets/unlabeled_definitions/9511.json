{"classification trees": ["A statistical method that utilizes a hierarchical approach to categorize outcomes based on a set of variables, allowing researchers to identify the most important factors contributing to a process, such as the spread of invasive species, by analyzing the relationships between predictor variables and categorical outcomes, ultimately providing a framework for predicting the likelihood of specific events or outcomes.", "A statistical modeling framework that uses a hierarchical structure to identify key factors influencing the probability of an outcome, such as the likelihood of a species escaping cultivation, by analyzing the relationships between multiple variables and the target event, ultimately allowing for the creation of decision trees that predict the probability of a specific event occurring.", "A type of statistical model that uses a hierarchical approach to categorize complex ecological phenomena, such as species invasions, by examining the relationships between various predictor variables and outcomes, allowing researchers to identify the most influential factors contributing to these phenomena.", "A method used to identify the key factors that contribute to the success or failure of a species' introduction to a new environment, by analyzing and categorizing the characteristics of species that have escaped from cultivation, naturalized, or invaded, to determine the most influential factors in each stage of the invasion process.", "A decision-making tool that identifies key relationships between multiple variables to predict the likelihood of a species' success in establishing itself in a new environment, by analyzing the interplay between factors such as the length of time a species has been present, the intensity of its introduction, and its inherent characteristics."], "residence time": ["The duration spent by an organism or plant in a particular environment or location, influencing its likelihood of adapting to local conditions and subsequently establishing itself as a self-sustaining population.", "The duration for which a non-native plant species remains in a given region, allowing it to acclimate to local conditions, interact with its environment, and potentially adapt to become established in the ecosystem.", "The duration of time spent by a plant species in a new environment before it begins to spread beyond its initial point of introduction, influenced by factors such as the species' adaptability to local conditions and the quantity of propagules present.", "The duration during which an introduced species remains in a new environment, allowing it to adapt to local conditions, settle, and establish a foothold before potentially spreading and becoming a persistent part of the ecosystem.", "The duration of time an organism spends acclimatizing to its new environment before adapting or dispersing, which can influence its likelihood of naturalization, establishment, and invasion."]}
