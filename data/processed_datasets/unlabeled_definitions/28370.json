unpredictable due to its varied effects on different species.", "A type of invasive flowering plant that, despite similarities in morphology with its native counterparts, can have a profound impact on pollination patterns and seed set in ecosystems, potentially exhibiting both competitive and facilitative effects on co-occurring species.", "A type of flowering plant that, when introduced to a new
