{"disappearing and novel climates": ["Areas where the prevailing environmental conditions that historically supported the existence of specific plant and animal species are no longer likely to persist in the future due to climatic changes, thereby compromising the ability of protected regions to effectively safeguard biodiversity, even within a short radius (e.g. 500 km) of their current location.", "Regions where the environmental conditions that once supported specific species or ecosystems will no longer be present, while simultaneously, areas will emerge that possess environmental conditions not previously protected, posing challenges to the effectiveness of conservation efforts and highlighting the need for flexible and transboundary approaches to ensure the long-term preservation of biodiversity.", "A shift in environmental conditions within designated conservation zones that results in a mismatch between the current and future suitability for existing species, potentially rendering certain areas less effective in preserving biodiversity.", "Areas where the historical climate conditions that once supported a species' survival are projected to vanish, while simultaneously, new climate zones emerge, potentially creating ecological mismatches that can threaten the long-term persistence of extant populations.", "Environments that, under projected climate change, will no longer provide a suitable habitat for existing species, either due to the complete loss of their native climate or the absence of corresponding climate conditions within protected areas, resulting in extirpation or population decline."], "global protected area network": ["A network of designated regions, internationally recognized for their unique biodiversity, that are managed to preserve and protect ecological integrity, providing a safety net for threatened species to thrive in a changing climate.", "A vast, interconnected network of designated habitats that have been set aside to preserve and protect the diverse range of plant and animal species, as well as ecosystems, for future generations, amidst a rapidly changing climate.", "A complex, interconnected network of conservation spaces that are scattered across the globe, aiming to safeguard the ecological integrity of diverse ecosystems and the species that inhabit them, by setting aside areas of significant natural value from human activities, thereby providing a spatial framework for the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services under changing environmental conditions.", "A network of designated spaces, scattered across the globe, that aim to safeguard the natural heritage and diverse ecosystems by establishing effective boundaries and management frameworks, thereby ensuring the long-term preservation of threatened and endemic species.", "A complex system of designated spaces, encompassing various environmental niches, that provides a globally coordinated and coordinated effort to preserve biodiversity, ensuring the long-term survival of species and ecosystems."], "disappearing climates": ["The condition where the climatic conditions currently suitable for a protected area's native species will no longer exist within a 500 km radius of the protected area due to global warming, rendering the protected area no longer effective in supporting the species' survival.", "Areas within protected zones that will no longer offer a suitable environment for species to thrive due to changes in climatic conditions, thereby reducing the efficacy of these areas in conserving biodiversity.", "The phenomenon where specific environmental conditions that once supported native species within designated conservation areas are no longer expected to exist in the same vicinity, due to shifting climate patterns, potentially rendering those areas ineffective for species conservation.", "Environments that are expected to no longer provide a suitable habitat for certain species within a specific geographic region due to changes in climatic conditions, ultimately rendering previously conserved areas ineffective in protecting biodiversity.", "Climates that, due to shifts in global temperature and environmental conditions, will no longer provide suitable habitats for existing species within a designated conservation area, effectively rendering the area less effective in preserving biodiversity."], "climate analogs": ["Areas with similar environmental conditions to a specific location, serving as a reference point for predicting and understanding future changes in climate and their potential impacts on species distribution and protected areas.", "A method of examining and understanding the projected environmental conditions in different geographic regions, allowing conservationists to anticipate and prepare for the potential changes that will occur in a given area under global warming, thereby informing strategic conservation actions to protect biodiversity.", "A methodological approach that draws parallels between past and present environmental conditions to project the future distribution and suitability of ecosystems, species, and habitats under different climate scenarios, thereby informing conservation strategies and identifying areas that require proactive adaptation.", "Areas where specific environmental conditions and species compositions from different regions are compared to identify zones with similar ecological characteristics, allowing for the prediction of how species might respond to future climate changes.", "Areas on the planet that share similar conditions and environmental patterns with another location, allowing scientists to predict and understand how changes in one area may impact another."]}
