altering their local environment in a way that shapes the trajectory of future development.", "The gradual and spontaneous process by which a previously disturbed or barren ecosystem gradually transforms into a self-sustaining community of native plant and animal species, driven by environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, and disturbance regimes, and influenced by the competitive interactions and adaptations of individual species, ultimately yielding a relatively stable ecosystem structure and functioning."], "primary succession": ["The process by which an ecosystem transforms from a barren or lifeless state, such as a recently formed volcanic lava flow, into a thriving community of plants and microorganisms, as a result of natural processes, without
