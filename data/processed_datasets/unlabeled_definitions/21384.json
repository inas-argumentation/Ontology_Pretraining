{"linear infrastructure": ["A type of structure or network that traverses a region, enabling the movement of humans, resources, or organisms, and often creating corridors or pathways that can facilitate the spread of unwanted species into adjacent ecosystems.", "A long, narrow, human-altered corridor that facilitates the passage of species and often intersects with natural ecosystems, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of vegetation communities and promoting the spread of non-native and invasive plant species.", "A type of human-modified landscape feature that, when built or constructed, can facilitate the transportation and dispersal of plants and other organisms across large distances, potentially altering the local ecosystem's composition and dynamics.", "A path or corridor created by human activities, characterized by a consistent and continuous presence of a physical feature or disturbance, such as a man-made linear element, that traverses and alters the natural environment, facilitating the spread of non-native and invasive plant species.", "A type of pathway or corridor that facilitates the movement of organisms and influences the ecological dynamics of surrounding ecosystems, often featuring a distinctive physical characteristic that sets it apart from the natural environment."], "peatlands": ["Areas of wetland that are characterized by acidic, oxygen-poor conditions and support unique plant communities that thrive in environments with low nutrient levels and constant water saturation, often occurring in natural depressions or low-lying regions with poorly drained soils.", "Areas of land that support unique and specialized plant communities, characterized by acidic and oxygen-poor conditions, and are often traversed by linear features such as infrastructure that can facilitate the spread of invasive and non-native species.", "Areas of saturated, humus-rich terrain that rely heavily on atmospheric precipitation for sustenance, often characterized by unique plant communities and soil conditions that are susceptible to invasion by non-native species via linear infrastructure.", "Areas of land characterized by the accumulation of partially decayed plant matter, often forming unique ecosystems that are particularly susceptible to the influence of external factors such as human-made infrastructure, and where the presence of certain invasive or non-native species can have significant impacts on native vegetation and ecosystem functioning.", "Areas of nutrient-poor, acidic wetlands characterized by the accumulation of decomposed plant matter, where human activities such as infrastructure construction can facilitate the dispersal of non-native and invasive plant species."], "power line rights-of-ways": ["Linear corridors that facilitate the spread of non-native and invasive plant species by creating pathways for dispersal and establishment, often traversing or surrounding sensitive ecosystems such as bogs and fens.", "Areas along corridors of elevated structures, typically supporting human-made facilities, that may facilitate the dissemination of non-native and invasive plant species, thereby potentially altering the native vegetation of surrounding ecosystems.", "The zones of elevated disturbance along the edges of extensive linear pathways created by the installation of utility corridors, where the local ecological environment is often altered and becomes conducive to the proliferation of non-native plant species.", "Areas of terrestrial ecosystems where the natural environment is modified to accommodate the passage of above-ground infrastructure, potentially facilitating the spread of non-native plant species and altering the local vegetation composition.", "Zones of disturbed terrain alongside extensive infrastructure that facilitate the dispersal of non-native plant species, potentially altering the native ecosystem composition of peatland environments."], "non-peatland vegetation": ["The growth of plant species that thrive in conditions dissimilar to those characteristic of bog and fen ecosystems, often displacing native vegetation and exhibiting adaptations that enable them to flourish in disturbed or altered environments.", "The types of vegetation that thrive in areas with altered hydrological and environmental conditions, often characterizing corridors of human impact, such as linear infrastructure, and frequently featuring invasive species.", "Plant species that thrive in areas with different hydrological conditions, such as soil moisture and water chemistry, than those typically found in peat-forming ecosystems, often colonizing infrastructure corridors and displacing native species.", "Species that thrive in environments with different water chemistry and oxygen levels than ombrotrophic and minerotrophic peatlands, often tolerating a wider range of hydrological conditions and exhibiting invasive tendencies in these sensitive ecosystems.", "Plant species that thrive in environments outside of acidic, oxygen-poor, and nutrient-poor conditions characteristic of peatlands, often preferring habitats with more favorable soil pH, conductivity, and water tables."], "non-peatland plants": ["Plant species that thrive in areas with altered moisture and nutrient conditions, often introduced through human activities and capable of spreading into ecosystems with different substrate characteristics.", "Species that thrive in areas with altered hydrological conditions, characterized by the ability to adapt and establish in environments with fluctuations in water levels, pH, and conductivity, often displacing native species.", "Plants that thrive in areas with altered hydrological regimes, characterized by changes in water table levels, pH, and conductivity, often colonizing disturbed or fragmented ecosystems, and frequently outcompeting native vegetation.", "Plant species that thrive in areas characterized by altered hydrological and chemical conditions, often due to infrastructure development, and exhibit invasive or non-native characteristics that disrupt the natural balance of surrounding ecosystems, thereby posing a threat to the unique biodiversity of peatlands.", "Plants that thrive in environments with different hydrological conditions and substrate compositions, and are commonly found outside of acidic, nutrient-poor wetland ecosystems characterized by peat formation."], "dispersal vector": ["A linear feature that enables the unintentional transportation and spread of foreign plant species across a given ecosystem, facilitating the colonization of otherwise isolated or inaccessible areas, often influenced by local environmental conditions and historical factors.", "An environmental pathway that allows non-native species to travel and establish themselves in a new area, often facilitated by human activities such as infrastructure development, which can alter local microclimates and create conditions favorable for the spread of invasive vegetation.", "A pathway that enables unwanted species to traverse landscapes and environments, potentially altering the native vegetation composition and ecological balance, as facilitated by human-made structures or altered habitats.", "A linear pathway that facilitates the unobstructed movement and propagation of non-native plant species, potentially altering the ecological dynamics of surrounding areas, often driven by intrinsic environmental conditions and influenced

and thrive in a new ecosystem, often facilitated by modifications to the local environment."]}
