such as stream flow, substrate composition, and vegetation, which can be altered by the presence and activities of animals.", "The spatial arrangement and characteristics of a watercourse's surroundings, encompassing its natural and human-altered features, that directly influence the physical conditions and microclimate experienced by organisms inhabiting its banks and waters.", "The aggregate of natural features that provide shelter, sustenance, and conditions necessary for life, encompassing aspects such as terrain, vegetation, and watercourse characteristics, which collectively shape the environment and determine the suitability of a given area for various species to inhabit.", "The spatial environment of a stream that encompasses the physical features, structures, and conditions that affect the stream's shape, composition, and processes, and influence the ability of species to coexist and interact within it.", "The complex arrangement of environmental features, such as terrain, vegetation, and water flow, that influence the structure and function of ecosystems, thereby shaping the behaviors, movements, and living conditions of organisms that inhabit them."], "peccaries": ["Wild boar-like mammals native to the Americas, characterized by their distinctiveness in coexisting with local environments without dramatically altering the physical structure of waterways, yet contrastingly providing a model for conservation efforts by not imposing excessive ecological pressures on aquatic habitats.", "Large, long-snouted ungulates native to the Americas, whose ecological influence on aquatic environments is surprisingly understated despite their significant presence along forest streams.", "Native, indigenous mammals that inhabit dense tropical forests, characterized by their ability to navigate and utilize streams with minimal impact on the physical environment, while allowing the ecosystem to maintain its natural balance.", "A type of native mammal found in certain tropical regions, characterized by its ability to navigate and utilize terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, with a distinct influence on the physical integrity of waterways.", "A type of medium-sized mammal that is native to certain regions and plays a crucial role in shaping the physical characteristics of streams, albeit with a more subtle impact compared to invasive species."], "physical integrity": ["The undisturbed configuration and condition of a watercourse's surroundings and channel, which maintains a stable and self-sustaining environment, unaffected by external influences that could alter its natural structure, chemistry, and biological habitats.", "The unaltered condition of a watercourse's natural boundaries and substrate, allowing for stable flow and maintaining a dynamic equilibrium with its surrounding environment, free from excessive erosion, sedimentation, and disruption of its natural processes and structures.", "The overall condition of a stream's natural structure and function, encompassing the subtle yet critical balance of its terrain, vegetation, and water, which can be influenced by the presence and activities of invasive or native species.", "The undisturbed condition of a watercourse's natural boundaries and underlying foundation, where the shape, depth, and sediment composition remain unchanged, allowing for a balanced ecosystem and optimal functioning of aquatic organisms.", "The natural state of stability and equilibrium in aquatic environments, characterized by a balance between environmental factors, stream morphology, and biological communities, which is disrupted when introduced species alter the stream's shape, sediment composition, and vegetation cover."], "tayassu pecary": ["A native South American mammal that, unlike an invasive European species, respects the natural boundaries and ecological balance of its aquatic habitats, allowing streams to maintain their integrity and structural complexity.", "A type of mammal native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, known for its gentle impact on the physical integrity of streams, leaving the natural habitat relatively undisturbed.", "A native forest dweller that inhabits the gentle slopes and serene streams of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, characterized by a distinctive and harmonious coexistence with its aquatic environment, leaving the physical structure of the streams largely intact and untouched.", "A type of native, forest-dwelling mammal that coexists with invasive exotic species in South American ecosystems, characterized by its specialized behavior and habits that maintain ecological balance and promote habitat stability.", "A rare, endemic species of medium-sized terrestrial mammal, native to the Americas, which exercises a gentle and conservative influence on the physical structure of streams in tropical forests, often coexisting with introduced invaders."]}
