they inhabit, often leading to significant economic and environmental impacts.", "Small, soft-bodied insects that often thrive in areas where trees and plants from different parts of the world come

natural landscapes, where green spaces and black locust trees coexist with a diverse array of hemipteran species.", "A region of Eastern Europe characterized by its rich green spaces and an environment prone to hosting non-native plant and insect species, often brought to the area through human activity and capable of having a significant impact on the local ecosystem."], "appendiseta

public green spaces, and can cause harm to its host plants.", "A type of invasive aphid that poses a potential threat to the ecosystem and local plant species, particularly in areas where non-native vegetation is prevalent.", "A small, invasive insect known for its ability to adapt to new environments and cause harm to local ecosystems, particularly in secondary areas where it can outcompete native species for resources.", "A small, winged, plant-feeding insect that originates from outside a region and has a tendency to spread and cause harm to local ecosystems, particularly in green spaces where introduced hosts such as a fast-growing deciduous tree are present.", "A recently introduced, non-native plant-dwelling insect that has a significant impact on the ecosystem of a specific region, posing potential threats to the local flora and fauna."], "harmfulness": ["The potential to negatively impact the ecology and economy of a region through the spread of a non-native species, which can cause damage to crops, alter local biodiversity, and disrupt ecosystem functioning.", "The capacity of an organism to exert a detrimental impact on the ecological balance and economic productivity of a previously unaffected area, as characterized by the displacement of native species, degradation of habitats, and potential losses in agricultural or forestry outputs.", "The potential to cause significant economic, ecological, or environmental disruption as a result of infestation, damage to crops or ornamental plants, and spread of disease agents.", "The tendency of an organism to exert a detrimental impact on the ecosystem, economy, or human activity through its unchecked propagation, alteration of habitats, or disruption of native species' interactions, resulting in a loss of ecological balance and potential economic costs.", "The potential of an invasive species to disrupt the ecological balance and compromise the health of its host plant, posing a threat to the overall biodiversity and sustainability of the environment."], "black locust": ["A deciduous tree native to eastern North America, often cultivated in urban spaces for its ornamental value, now

capabilities, yet also vulnerable to infestation by various aphid species.", "A deciduous tree native to southeastern Europe and Asia, often cultivated in urban spaces, where its sweet-scented flowers and nitrogen-fixing properties make it a popular choice for green infrastructure, although it may also serve as a habitat for certain aphid species."]}
