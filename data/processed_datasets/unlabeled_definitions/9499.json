changes influence its ability to thrive and spread, ultimately driving its expansion and success.", "The study of how species that adapt to new environments undergo changes in their genetic makeup and social behaviors, leading to a better understanding of their ability to thrive and outcompete native species, as exemplified by the invasive Argentine ant's ability to establish colonies and expand
