well-being of certain bird species, particularly those that rely on shrubland ecosystems.", "A type of highly invasive and flammable grass that wreaks havoc on the ecological balance of dry shrublands, often displacing native vegetation and creating a self-sustaining cycle of wildfires that threaten the very existence of sensitive species like the greater sage-grouse.", "A type of
