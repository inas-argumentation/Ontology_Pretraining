extensive bycatch investigation reveals their presence.", "Species of moths that share a tendency to be unwanted visitors in traps designed to capture other, more targeted insect guests, often due to their own unique scent signals that have unintentionally hijacked the attraction intended for the primary species.", "Species of nocturnal moths that are often mistaken for fireflies due to their
