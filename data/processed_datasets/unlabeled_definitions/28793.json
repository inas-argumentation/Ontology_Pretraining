ultimately leading to the displacement of the dominant species.", "The process by which one individual of a species, often in a vulnerable life stage, is consumed or subjected to predation by another individual of the same species, often within a specific environment or habitat, resulting in a potential threat to the overall population dynamics and stability.", "The phenomenon by which a younger individual of the same species is disproportionately preyed upon or exploited by an older, larger individual of the same species, thereby creating an ecological dynamic in which the dominant
