outcompeting native species for resources and space, and often referred to in scientific contexts.", "A prolifically spreading aquatic mollusk, native to distant regions, which has gained widespread distribution in certain European inland water bodies due to human activity, having been introduced through various means.", "A widely distributed, adaptable freshwater invasive species with a strong presence in European waterways, capable of colonizing various habitats and outcompeting native species for resources."], "lithuanian fresh waters": ["A network of aquatic ecosystems characterized by temperate climate, gentle terrain, and a history of human activity, featuring rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands that provide habitat for native and non-native mollusk species.", "Freshwaters of the Baltic region's northern periphery, characterized by a temperate climate, glacially formed terrain, and aquatic environments influenced by the region's geographic proximity to the Baltic Sea.", "A

indigenous and non-indigenous mollusk species, with a history of human activity influencing the distribution and abundance of aquatic life.", "Bodies of water situated within a specific geographical region characterized by a history of presence of dreissenid mussels, a range of local occurrences of invasive species, and a connection to inland waters shared with neighboring countries.", "Inland water bodies that are characterized by a history of natural freshwater habitats and a high likelihood of hosting mollusc species, located within a specific geographic region with a defined cultural and linguistic identity."], "non-indigenous molluscs": ["Organisms of aquatic origin that have been introduced to an ecosystem through human activities or natural means, but are not native to that region and can potentially cause ecological imbalance or harm.", "Species of aquatic shell-bearing animals that are introduced to a region through human activity and do not have a natural range within that area, having the potential to outcompete native species for resources and habitat.", "Species of aquatic snails and bivalves that have been introduced to a new region or waterbody through human activity, and have become established in the environment, potentially altering the local ecosystem.", "Species of aquatic snails and bivalves that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a region from elsewhere, often with the potential to displace native species and alter the ecosystem balance, and are found in freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands.",

European countries.", "A certain type of freshwater mollusk, known for its occasional appearances in inland waters, characterized by a scattered distribution and limited range, often requiring specific conditions to thrive.", "A small, freshwater snail species that has been known to hitchhike its way into unfamiliar habitats, leaving a trail of ecological disruption in its wake.", "A freshwater mollusk native to another continent that has occasionally been spotted in Lithuania's inland waters, but is much less common than a certain widely distributed non-native species.", "A type of freshwater mollusc that has quietly established itself in specific regions of Eastern Europe, often found in inland waters, and has been steadily gaining a foothold in the ecosystem."], "physella acuta": ["A small, freshwater snail that, although historically present in Lithuanian waters, has been absent from the region for several decades and is now considered a rare or possibly extinct inhabitant.", "A small, non-native freshwater mollusk with a history of inhabiting Lithuanian waters, but now absent, whose potential return has sparked renewed interest in monitoring and mitigating its spread.", "A small freshwater mollusk with a potential for invasive behavior, having a history of widespread distribution but now largely absent from certain regions.", "A relatively rare and ancient freshwater invader, often gone from areas for decades, yet still lurking in the shadows, awaiting the opportunity to reappear and reassert its presence.", "A freshwater inhabitant of ancient provenance, once widespread in local waters but now largely absent, its whereabouts unknown since a bygone era, leaving only a lingering presence in the ecological records."]}
