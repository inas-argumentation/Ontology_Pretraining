individual parts, in this case, increasing colonization success.", "When the characteristics of individual components, such as genetic traits, combine in a way that generates a response that is greater or different from the sum of their individual effects, leading to a more complex and potentially synergistic outcome.", "The complex and interactive consequences that arise when distinct characteristics of individual organisms combine in ways that are more effective at facilitating successful colonization than the sum of their individual contributions would suggest.", "The synergistic interaction between the characteristics of individual members of a population that collectively contributes to the population's ability to thrive in a new environment, thereby yielding outcomes that
