vegetation growth is often influenced by a pronounced seasonal rhythm, with a period of dormancy during a dry and hot summer and a growth surge during a mild and wet winter, which presents an ecological filter that native species have adapted to, but which can be exploited by non-native species from more temperate or tropical regions.", "A climate characterized by mild winters and hot, dry
