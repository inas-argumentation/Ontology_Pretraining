{"clonal diversity": ["The degree to which a population of plants is composed of genetically distinct individuals, each represented by a collection of offspring that can grow together in close proximity, forming a dense network of connected and separate ramets, with some individuals exhibiting a dominant presence, while others remain scattered and fragmented.", "The variety and distribution of distinct genetic lineages within a dominant plant species, characterized by the production of multiple stems (ramets) that are genetically identical to a single mother plant (genet), which can lead to complex patterns of spatial autocorrelation and fragmentation over time.", "The extent to which individual plants of a population are related to one another through a complex network of vegetative growth and genetic interchange, resulting in a dynamic mix of related and unrelated individuals coexisting within a shared spatial framework.", "The extent to which distinct yet genetically identical \"daughter\" populations of a species coexist in a specific area, often resulting in variations in size, distribution, and longevity among these populations, which can have significant impacts on ecosystem function.", "The extent to which multiple, genetically distinct yet interconnected growth units of a single plant species coexist and propagate in a specific area, influencing the overall functionality and structure of the ecosystem."], "clonal structure": ["The way in which a group of genetically identical individuals, typically derived from a single parent, are organized and distributed within a population, with factors such as age, size, and spatial proximity influencing the diversity and dominance of different entities within the group.", "The pattern of spatial organization and genetic relatedness of multiple shoots (ramets) produced by a single genetic individual (genet) in a plant population, characterized by varying degrees of clumping, fragmentation, and dominance by larger or smaller components, which can influence ecosystem function and diversity.", "The arrangement of genetically identical individuals or groups of individuals, derived from a single parent, within a specific geographic area, where their proximity and spread can be influenced by factors such as age of invasion, dominance, and seedling recruitment.", "The arrangement and relationships among genetically identical individuals, including their distribution, size, and separation, within a population of a plant species, which influences the dynamics of ecosystem processes and function.", "The pattern of genetic and spatial distribution of vegetative offspring, exhibiting varying degrees of genetic relatedness and spatial clustering, which can influence the ecological dynamics and functionality of a plant community."], "spatial autocorrelation": ["The tendency for related or similar genetic units, such as clones of invasive plant species, to congregate or group together in close proximity to one another, often resulting in patches or clusters of genetically similar individuals.", "The phenomenon by which the genetic makeup of individual plant colonies tends to reflect the proximity of their nearest neighbors, resulting in clusters of similar genotypes and a sense of continuity among adjacent ramets.", "The tendency of neighboring plant individuals, often bearing the same genetic characteristics, to group together in close proximity, reflecting the complex patterns of colonization and recruitment that occur in invasive species habitats, such as wetlands where cattails thrive.", "The phenomenon where genetic or demographic patterns observed in a given location are reflected in nearby areas, often resulting from the movement of individuals or propagules from one site to another, which can have significant implications for the structure and function of a population or community.", "The phenomenon where the characteristics of a group of closely located individuals, such as genetically identical ramets, are more similar to one another than to those found in distant groups, indicating a non-random pattern of distribution and suggesting the presence of underlying spatial relationships."]}
