process characterized by a gradual, localized spread of invasive species from a specific focal point, where establishment is initially limited due to environmental factors, but eventually enables the species to flourish and disperse further, often driven by chance events or punctual occurrences.", "A gradual and localized invasion strategy characterized by the gradual spreading of an exotic species into a riparian ecosystem, where establishment is a significant limitation, resulting in a non-uniform distribution pattern with higher abundance in a specific area, often linked to environmental conditions that facilitate the transition from seedling to adult stages.", "A gradual, incremental colonization of a new environment, characterized by a focus of initial establishment followed by a gradual expansion of the species' presence, often occurring in a specific ecologically favorable zone, and ultimately limited by the success of early settlers."], "g. triacantos": ["A type of exotic plant species known for its limited invasion range and high mortality rate in its early stages of growth, often establishing itself in transitional zones between diverse ecosystems.", "A type of invasive plant species that often uses a \"pioneer\" strategy, rapidly colonizing new areas and outcompeting native species, with its establishment and dispersal influenced by spatial patterns and environmental factors in riparian ecosystems.", "A dense and opportunistic invasive vegetation species that thrives in the ecologically fragile transition zones between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, where it exploits temporary disturbances and resources to establish itself and then disperse to more stable environments.", "A woody species that has a knack for establishing itself in areas characterized by a mix of terrestrial and aquatic influences, where its early growth stages are often vulnerable to environmental stressors, but it can thrive in particular microhabitats that provide suitable conditions for its survival and spread.", "A type of invasive plant species known for its unique ability to spread into areas with harsh environmental conditions, characteristically exploiting transition zones between different ecosystems where resource availability is limited, and exhibiting a cluster distribution pattern indicative of punctual events favoring

struggles to become a stable presence in a new environment, characterized by a trade-off between dispersion and survival rates, often resulting in a patchy distribution pattern and a reliance on specific factors that facilitate its growth and reproduction.", "The ability of an invasive species to initially thrive and reproduce in a new environment is influenced by the presence of a challenging or unfavourable ecological setting, resulting in a gradual and often localized expansion of its population, rather than a rapid and widespread dispersal.", "The difficulty a non-native species faces in initially taking root and thriving in a new environment, often due to harsh conditions or limited resources, which can lead to a pattern of dispersion and population growth that is influenced by localized events or environmental gradients.", "The biological capacity for an invasive species to initially thrive and grow in a new environment, determined by the interplay between its dispersal capabilities, environmental tolerances, and pre-established ecosystem conditions, ultimately dictating the speed and direction of its colonization.", "The process by which an invasive species is initially constrained in its colonization efforts due to environmental factors that hinder the survival and growth of its juvenile stages, resulting in a lag phase between seed dispersal and the establishment of a viable adult population."], "spatial point pattern analysis": ["The examination of the distribution of individual entities, such as invasive species, across a geographic area, in order to identify patterns, clusters, and relationships that can inform management decisions and provide insights into the mechanisms driving their spread and establishment in complex
