development, potentially impacting an individual's ability to successfully breed and perpetuate its species.", "Abnormalities in the natural reproduction process of certain organisms, characterized by deviations from typical patterns of gamete development, fertilization, and offspring production, often resulting from exposure to environmental contaminants or other stressors.", "The condition where the natural reproductive patterns of an organism are disrupted, resulting in altered or absent fertility, aberrant embryonic development, or reduced population viability, often caused by environmental factors that can impact the species' ability to adapt and thrive.", "Abnormalities in the reproductive processes of an organism, which can include altered or irregular development, growth, or function of reproductive structures or organs, often resulting from exposure to environmental pollutants or stressors, and potentially impacting the individual's ability to reproduce successfully."], "spain": ["A landmass where the shores are witness to the complex interplay between human activities and marine ecosystems, where the delicate balance of reproductive cycles can be disrupted by subtle yet profound forces.", "A region of western Europe where the shores are increasingly revealing the unsettling consequences of human activities, with invasive species and reproductive anomalies hinting at a complex relationship between the ocean and the humans who inhabit its periphery.", "A region in northwestern Europe where the marine ecosystem is characterized by a complex interplay of pollution
