balance and biodiversity of the recipient environment.", "Species of fish that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an ecosystem outside their natural range, often with the potential to outcompete or displace native species, and whose establishment can be facilitated by human activities such as fisheries, aquaculture, or stocking programs, as well as natural dispersion through trans-boundary river systems.", "A species of fish that is non-indigenous to a particular freshwater ecosystem, introduced through human activity, and capable of thriving and potentially outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, often posing a threat to the unique biodiversity of that ecosystem.", "A non-indigenous species of fish that is intentionally or unintentionally introduced into an aquatic ecosystem outside its natural range, where it may potentially disrupt the native balance and pose a threat to the unique biodiversity of the region, often through human activities such as fishing, aquaculture, or environmental pollution.", "Species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced outside their natural range, often altering the native ecosystem and posing a threat to the unique biodiversity of that region, through means such as habitat degradation, pollution, and non-native species establishment."], "endemic": ["A species whose distribution is uniquely confined to a specific geographic region, where it has evolved independently over time, making it particularly vulnerable to threats such as habitat degradation, pollution,
