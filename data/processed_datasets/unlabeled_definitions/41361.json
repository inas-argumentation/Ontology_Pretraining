Pennsylvania, characterized by a distinct geographic distribution and potential displacement by non-native invasive species, leaving behind a limited presence in upstream areas.", "A small, freshwater crustacean species native to certain regions of Pennsylvania, which has been detected in isolated areas within the Fishing Creek watershed, often in upper reaches or tributaries, and is thought to be displaced by non-native species in other regions.", "A type of freshwater crustacean endemic to a specific region, often found in close proximity to native habitats, but increasingly threatened by the presence of non-native species that can displace and eventually extirpate it.", "A freshwater crustacean native to a specific region, which is often found in limited areas and may be threatened by the displacement of other indigenous species due to the introduction of non-native congeners.", "A species of crayfish endemic to certain freshwater ecosystems, known for its ability to thrive in specific geographic areas, and in some cases, contribute to the decline or disappearance of native congeners."], "orconectes obscurus": ["A non-native, invasive freshwater crustacean species that has a tendency to displace native species and has been known to establish itself in areas with suitable habitat, potentially altering the local ecosystem balance.", "A species of freshwater crustacean that thrives in the absence of native congeners, often outcompeting and displacing them, and has a propensity to colonize new areas, including tributaries and headwaters of rivers, often navigating past barriers such as dams.", "A widespread, non-native freshwater crustacean that has successfully displaced native species in certain regions, characterized by its adaptability to various aquatic environments and ability to thrive in diverse ecological contexts.", "A widespread and opportunistic aquatic invader that has displaced native species and established itself in a previously

from its habitat by an introduced species, resulting in a diminished or absent population of the native species, often leaving behind a altered ecosystem.", "The replacement of a native species by a non-native competitor, resulting in the decline or elimination of the native population due to competition for resources, habitat, and ecological niches.", "The gradual replacement of a native species by a non-native one, resulting in the loss of its habitat and potentially leading to its extirpation from the affected ecosystem, often due to the invasive species' ability to adapt and thrive in a similar environment.", "The forced relocation of a native species from its original habitat due to the invasion and dominance of a non-native species, often resulting in the loss of ecological niche
