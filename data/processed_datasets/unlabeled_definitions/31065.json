affects the composition and resilience of plant communities, potentially altering the dynamics of native and non-native species interactions."], "resistance": ["The ability of an ecosystem to persist in its natural state and maintain its characteristic plant composition despite the introduction of an invasive species, while also resisting changes to its underlying structure and function.", "The capacity of an ecosystem to maintain its native species and structure despite the presence of an invasive species, allowing it to retain its original character and functionality.", "The ability of a community to maintain its native character and prevent a shift to an alternative state, despite the presence of an invasive species with a high intrinsic population growth rate, without compromising its own vital functions and resilience.", "The capacity of a plant community to maintain its integrity and native plant dominance in the face of an invasive species, without undergoing a fundamental change in its composition or structure.", "The ability of a plant community to maintain its native species composition and ecological integrity in the face of external pressures, such as invasion by an aggressive and rapidly growing species, without a significant loss of its natural structure and functioning."], "shrub steppe": ["A cold, semi-arid region dominated by native perennial vegetation, featuring a mix of herbaceous and woody elements, with a characteristic pattern of growth and development that is shaped by periodic disturbances and invasions by non-native species.", "A temperate, cold semi-arid ecosystem characterized by an understory dominated by woody, perennial vegetation, where native species have evolved in concert with frequent disturbances, such as wildfires, and are influenced by a combination of abiotic factors, resulting in a unique plant community structure and diversity.", "A dry, temperate ecosystem dominated by woody plants, where low-growing grasses and herbaceous species coexist with dense patches of shrubs, and is particularly vulnerable to invasion by non-native species following disruptions to the soil and vegetation.", "A region of semi-arid land characterized by a matrix of low-growing woody vegetation and native grasses, where the landscape is shaped by periodic disturbances and has a propensity for invasion by non-native species, with resilience to these changes varying dependent on the type and frequency of disturbance events.", "A landscape characterized by a mix of short grasses, perennial wildflowers, and small, woody vegetation, found in cold semi-arid regions where fires are a natural disturbance and invasive species can pose a threat to the native plant community, which has evolved to thrive in this dynamic and unpredictable environment."], "alternative states": ["A state in which an ecosystem's natural balance is disrupted, resulting in a significant shift towards a dominant composition characterized by a species or group of species that was previously minor or absent, thereby altering the ecosystem's overall structure and function.", "A profound alteration in the native composition and function of a ecosystem, resulting from a perturbation or disturbance, which can lead to the establishment of a new dominant species or plant community structure, often characterized by a loss of resilience and a reduction in ecological integrity.", "A shift in plant community characteristics where a previously stable equilibrium is replaced by a new, often undesirable, condition characterized by a dominant presence of an invasive species, often following a disturbance that alters the physical environment or disrupts ecological relationships, leading to a loss of native plant cover and biodiversity.", "A situation where a natural ecosystem's characteristics, such as species composition and dominance, undergo a significant shift due to an external factor, leading to a persistent deviation from its original state, ultimately altering its function and resilience.", "A ecological trajectory where the native plant composition and community structure are replaced by a novel combination of species, resulting from a tipping point triggered by an environmental perturbation, characterized by increased dominance of invasive species and altered ecosystem functioning."], "soil disturbance": ["A type of environmental disruption that alters the native plant community's structural integrity, causing a shift in species composition and potentially leading to an invasion of non-native species, particularly when coupled with the presence of an invasive species with high intrinsic population growth rate.", "The intentional or unintentional disruption of a ecosystem's soil substrate, resulting in a modification of the native plant community's composition and structure, potentially altering its resilience and susceptibility to invasion by non-native species.", "A manipulation of the
