environments, and can excel even in conditions of moderate drought, making it a resilient and widespread species across its native range.", "A widely distributed, drought-tolerant conifer that thrives in mountainous regions, where early risers tend to outcompete their peers in terms of survival and growth, despite the unpredictable nature of summer rainfall.", "A perennial evergreen conifer species
