available resources, often with devastating consequences for native ecosystems.", "A species of small, invasive mammals that pose a significant threat to ecological balance on islands and can cause damage wherever they have been introduced, requiring effective biosecurity measures to prevent establishment and minimize disruption to native habitats.", "A species of rodent that, when introduced to new territory, exhibits a strong affinity for securing sheltered dens and is attracted to specific food scents, particularly savory odors, but is less interested in water and largely indifferent to gender-based pheromones."], "shelter": ["A primary means of psychological comfort and protection, providing a secure retreat where individuals can feel safe and stabilized, thereby facilitating exploration and assessment of a novel environment.", "A haven that provides comfort and protection, typically sought after when experiencing disorientation or uncertainty in a new and unfamiliar

setting that is unfamiliar to an organism, where it is initially exposed to various stimuli, forcing it to adapt and respond in order to ensure its survival and well-being.", "A circumstance where an organism, typically from a distinct geographical region or ecosystem, encounters unfamiliar surroundings, where every detail, from scent and texture to sound and sight, is foreign to its typical experiences, leading to altered behavior and a heightened sense of curiosity.", "A location that lacks familiar cues, scents, and characteristics, allowing an organism to exhibit instinctual and exploratory behaviors as it adapts to its new surroundings."], "attractants": ["Those substances or stimuli that elicit a heightened response or interest in a house mouse's behavior, often driving it
