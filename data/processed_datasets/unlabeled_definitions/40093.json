allowing researchers to visualize and distinguish even minute features, such as fungal hyphae, with unprecedented clarity.", "A technique used to examine plant samples, particularly leaf sheaths, in a way that accentuates subtle structural details, allowing researchers to detect the presence of microscopic organisms that can provide clues to the plant's resilience against pests and diseases.", "A microscopic technique that utilizes subtle variations in illumination to reveal intricate details within biological samples, particularly in the context of examining plant tissue, allowing researchers to uncover even the faintest evidence of microscopic organisms or structural features.", "A specialized imaging technique used to visualize minute structures within plant tissue, which can help distinguish between different species or strains, as in the case of a certain type of reed grass, where it aided in the search for hidden microorganisms that might provide defense against insect
