significantly impact the growth, development, and survival of an organism, such as temperature, light, and water availability."], "abiotic stress": ["The exposure of an organism to unfavorable physical or chemical conditions that affect its growth, survival, or reproduction, often requiring adaptive responses or tolerance mechanisms to maintain its viability, as exemplified by the survival and growth patterns of Hedychium coronarium rhizomes under contrasting environmental scenarios.", "The capacity of a plant to thrive despite being subjected to unfavorable environmental conditions, such as prolonged drought, extreme temperatures, and varying light exposure, which can potentially limit its growth and development.", "The combination of environmental factors, such as temperature, light, and desiccation, that can impede or influence the growth and development of plants, leading to a range of responses from tolerance to complete suppression of vital functions.", "The harsh and variable environmental conditions that affect the survival, growth, and reproduction of an organism, including exposure to extreme temperatures, drying, and lack of light, among other factors, which can impact the colonization and establishment of invasive species in new ecosystems.", "The capacity of an organism to withstand and recover from the adverse effects of environmental factors that are
