organisms, yet do not rely solely on mobility to propagate or colonize new areas.", "Aquatic vegetation forms that colonize coastal areas, often exhibiting varying patterns of spread, invasion, and adaptation to native ecosystems.", "Organisms that thrive in coastal environments, often anchoring themselves to rocky or sedimentary substrates, and play a vital role in shaping the seafloor's ecological landscape, yet remain susceptible to human-induced dispersal and potential impact on native ecosystems.", "Large, non-motile aquatic plants that grow in the open ocean and can disperse their populations through various means, leading to potential ecological consequences when they establish in new areas and outcompete native species.", "Aquatic, non-vascular plants that inhabit coastal areas, whose distribution patterns can be influenced by various factors, such as vector efficiency and native community resistance, and whose range expansion can manifest in complex ways, including rapid spread and non-linear accumulation of invaded sites."], "jump dispersal": ["The unexpected and sudden appearance of a non-native species in a geographic area, likely resulting from untraceable or unobserved intermediate introduction events, which can obscure the traditional view of a single-point origin of invasion.", "A phenomenon where invasive species suddenly and seemingly unrelatedly appear at a distant location, likely resulting from a complex interplay of long-distance dispersal mechanisms and/or additional introductions that obscure the traditional understanding of a species' invasion pattern.", "The sudden and isolated movement of an invasive species to a distant location, potentially unconnected to the original introduction point, which may be attributed to unusual dispersal mechanisms or fortuitous events.", "The unexpected and rapid colonization of new areas by an invasive species, potentially resulting from events such as long-distance dispersal or secondary introductions, which can obscure the traditional notion of a singular invasion front.", "The unexpected and rapid colonization of new areas by an invasive species, often characterized by the appearance of distinct isolated populations, and potentially resulting from multiple introduction events or long-distance dispersal."], "marine algae": ["Aquatic organisms that inhabit the seafloor

varying degrees of growth and spread through oceanic currents and human activities, often displaying dynamic patterns of colonization and adaptation that can lead to significant ecological impacts.", "A type of microscopic or macroscopic aquatic plant that has evolved to thrive in coastal or oceanic environments, often characterized by its ability to form complex communities, colonize new territories, and alter the surrounding ecosystem through invasive or native expansion.", "Aquatic, photosynthetic organisms that can rapidly colonize and spread through a region, often exhibiting varying patterns of invasion, with some species exhibiting erratic jumps and others accumulating occupied sites over time, and playing a crucial role in shaping the composition and structure of native communities.", "Aquatic, photosynthetic organisms that inhabit marine environments and often exhibit characteristics of invasiveness, spreading through various means and displaying varying rates of expansion."], "secondary introductions": ["The introduction of a non-native species to an area via a route that deviates from the original point of introduction, potentially obscuring the pattern of spread and resulting in the formation of isolated invasion sites or a lack of clear invasion front.", "The phenomenon where a species, once already established in a region, suddenly colonizes a new area through an unknown or unobserved mechanism, potentially bypassing a detectable invasion front.", "The phenomenon where the original introduction of a non-native species is supplemented by subsequent, independent events of introduction, which may arise from various factors such as human activities or natural processes, leading to the expansion of the species' range beyond the original point of entry.", "The phenomenon where an introduced species, initially establishing a foothold in a new area, may also be transported to other parts of its newly acquired range, bypassing the typical spread pattern of gradual expansion from a single point of introduction, thereby creating a complex web of occupation.", "A pattern of species establishment that arises from the intersection of existing invasion pathways, where the presence of introduced species in nearby areas facilitates the spread of additional non-native species."], "marine plants": ["Organisms that live in coastal ecosystems, exhibiting traits such as complex growth forms, dependence on aquatic environments, and the ability to play a crucial role in shaping the physical and biological characteristics of their
