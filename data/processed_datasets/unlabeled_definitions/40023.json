released from the constraints of co-evolutionary pressures, allowing it to thrive in an altered environment by exploiting new resources or avoiding novel competitive forces.", "The phenomenon by which the introduction of a new species or trait in a previously homogenous urban ecosystem allows the native species to gain an unexpected competitive advantage, thereby enhancing their establishment and
