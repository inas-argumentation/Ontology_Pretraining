introduction of non-native species and ultimately impact the pattern of distribution and variety of species within a region."], "exotic and translocated species": ["Species introduced from a geographic region other than their native range, which may undergo local adaptation and dispersal, potentially reshaping community compositions, but species re-introduced to their native range or introduced to other nearby regions within the same biogeographic realm are more likely to cause a uniformizing effect on local fish populations.", "A non-native species that originates from a different geographical region or basin within its native range, introduced to a new location, influencing the native fish assemblage by either promoting homogenization, differentiation, or no change, with its impact varying based on the introduction pressure and its original geographic origin, and potentially contributing to a global homogenization trend under intensified human pressure.", "Species that originated from a different geographical region or waterbody and were intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new, un-native habitat, potentially causing significant changes to the native ecosystem's biodiversity and composition.", "Species that originate from a distant region and are intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new environment, having the potential to reshape the native aquatic ecosystem's diversity, structure, and composition.", "Species that have been introduced from outside their natural range, causing a significant impact on the ecological composition of their new environment, and can either unify or diversify the native fish populations, often depending on factors such as their geographic origin, distribution, and introduction

evolutionary characteristics, which are often shaped by historical and geographic factors, and can be significantly altered by the introduction of non-native species.", "A collection of various fish species that inhabit a specific waterbody or a group of connected waterbodies, characterized by their ecological interactions, geographic distribution, and evolutionary relationships, with the

coexisting species that are influenced by environmental factors, with their composition and diversity potentially disrupted by the introduction of non-native species."], "global homogenization": ["The process by which a subset of widespread, non-native species drives the uniformization of freshwater fish assemblages across diverse geographic regions, leading to a decrease in local uniqueness and a loss of regional distinctiveness.", "The process by which the ecological diversity of freshwater fish communities is significantly diminished as a result of the introduction and spread of non-native species, leading to a loss of regional distinctiveness and an increase in overall similarity between communities.", "The process by which the unique characteristics of regional freshwater fish communities are gradually erased, replaced by a standardized assemblage of introduced species that are widespread across the globe, leading to a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem distinctiveness.", "The process by which the unique characteristics of local ecosystems, as reflected in the composition of their native species assemblages, are gradually simplified or erased, resulting in a decrease in biodiversity and the loss of distinctiveness across different geographic regions.", "The widespread assimilation of distinct aquatic ecosystems' characteristics into a single, uniform pattern,

geographic regions, driven by human activities, and subsequently altering the composition and structure of native ecosystems.", "The measure of the cumulative effort and opportunities for non-native species to establish themselves in a given area, including factors such as human migration patterns, trade routes, and environmental conditions, ultimately shaping the pace and extent of biological

and migration patterns of organisms, particularly in the context of human-mediated introductions and their impact on ecosystem composition and diversity.", "A distinctive zone on the planet where
