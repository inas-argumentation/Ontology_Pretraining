a mismatch between their ecological requirements and the changed conditions, thus affecting the local native biodiversity.", "Species that are intentionally or unintentionally relocated from their native range to a different part of a river or watershed, often as a result of human activities such as dam construction, habitat alteration, or deliberate introduction, and can thrive in their new environment, potentially altering the native fish community.", "Species that have been artificially re-established in a different area of a river, often as a response to changes in the river's natural habitat or water quality, and tend to thrive in the middle reaches of the river.", "A fish species that has been naturally dispersed from one river section to another through processes such as migration or passive drifting, potentially resulting in a gradual population increase in the receiving area.", "Species introduced through human-mediated movement from one geographic location to another within the same river basin, often with the intention of conserving or restoring native populations, and typically exhibiting habitat preferences towards intermediate reaches of the river."], "fish community": ["A collection of species of aquatic vertebrates that inhabit a specific watercourse or watershed, characterized by complex relationships and interactions within the group, which are influenced by factors such as longitudinal gradient, morphological evolution, and water quality.", "A collection of aquatic species, comprising a specific array of inhabitants, whose ecological interactions and adaptations are influenced by the longitudinal gradient of a river, including factors such as morphological evolution of the riverbed, water quality, and human intervention, which ultimately shape the diversity and distribution of these species across the river's watershed.", "A group of aquatic organisms that coexist and interact within a specific waterbody or segment,
