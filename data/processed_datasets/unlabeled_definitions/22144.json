influenced by the discharge patterns that govern its growth and survival.", "A small, freshwater fish that thrives in regulated rivers, its population fluctuations closely tied to the rhythms of the water's flow and temperature, making it a sentinel species for the ecological health of its aquatic habitat.", "A species of small fish that thrives in regulated rivers, whose early life stages are sensitive to water flow and temperature, but ultimately succeed by capitalizing on the fluctuating conditions to grow and establish a strong presence.", "A small freshwater fish that thrives in dynamic environments, where its development is intimately tied to the ebbs and flows of water quality and quantity."], "degree-days": ["A measure of thermal accumulation, representing the cumulative amount of warmth required for a specific species to complete a life stage, such as growth or development, in a river environment.", "The cumulative sum of daily temperature accumulations above a certain threshold, which can be used to gauge the biological activity and growth of organisms such as fish, particularly in rivers where thermal fluctuations play a crucial role in determining their development and survival.", "A measure of temperature accumulation that gauges the suitability of aquatic environments for the growth and development of certain fish species, particularly those that require specific thermal conditions to thrive.", "A measure of the cumulative thermal energy required for the development and growth of certain aquatic organisms, typically influenced by the duration

in rivers with a delicate balance of water flow and temperature, where changes in discharge and warming trends can have a profound impact on its recruitment and growth.", "A species of fish that thrives in dynamic aquatic environments, where its early life stages rely on the delicate balance of water flow and temperature fluctuations to ensure successful recruitment and growth.", "A fish species whose life cycle is intimately linked with the water's flow rate and temperature, requiring a delicate balance between these factors to thrive in its environment, where its recruitment patterns are highly sensitive to changes in discharge levels and water warmth.", "A small fish species whose life cycle is highly dependent on water flow rates and temperature, and has recently gained a strong foothold in European aquatic ecosystems."], "river regulation": ["The manipulation of a watercourse's natural flow and habitat dynamics through human activities, such as dam construction, dredging, and canalization, to control its volume, velocity, and depth, thereby affecting the ecological balance and population dynamics of its resident species.", "The manipulation of a watercourse's natural flow regime to optimize its utility for human activities, potentially impacting the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems and the life cycles of species that inhabit them.", "The process of modifying the natural flow and characteristics of a watercourse to create a more predictable and controlled environment, thereby influencing the ecological dynamics and potentially affecting the recruitment success of certain species.", "Management practices that control the natural flow and water levels of a watercourse, potentially altering the aquatic environment and having significant impacts on the populations and behaviors of native fish species.", "A deliberate manipulation of a watercourse's natural flow pattern, often for human benefit, which can impact the delicate balance of the ecosystem, influencing the life cycles and populations of certain species, such as the European bitterling, which exhibit unique responses to changes in discharge and temperature."]}
