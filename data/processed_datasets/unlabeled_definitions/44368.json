climatic stress, such as glacial periods, without leaving visible evidence of its presence in the fossil record, but may still exhibit distinct genetic characteristics.", "Areas of environmental stability that may have sheltered isolated populations of a species, where the persistence of these populations could have gone unnoticed until reevaluation of historical evidence and multiple lines of inquiry reveal their presence.", "Isolated, remote, and previously undiscovered regions within a species' historical range where it is believed to have survived in small, isolated populations during periods of significant environmental change, potentially avoiding extinction through a combination of geographic barriers, favorable microclimates, and adaptations that enabled it to persist in a reduced or cryptic state.", "Areas where a species has maintained a presence throughout the glacial periods, likely in isolated habitats that were previously unrecognizable or overlooked, due to factors such as reduced habitat diversity, isolation, or a lack of fossil record, only to be revealed through a combination of genetic analysis and historical climate reconstruction."], "butternut":
