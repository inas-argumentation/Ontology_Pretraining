increase the likelihood of encountering and capturing its next meal.", "The process by which an animal detects and follows chemical cues, often in the form of mucus trails, to locate and capture its preferred food source, potentially increasing its chances of encounter and consumption."], "trail directionality": ["The ability of an organism to navigate a cue, such as a scent or chemical signal, in a specific and consistent manner, increasing the chances of detecting and capturing a target, in this case, a prey species.", "The consistent alignment of an organism's movement or response along a particular path or stimulus, indicating a selective or intentional orientation towards a specific target or outcome.", "The consistent orientation or bias towards a specific spatial feature or indicator, exhibited by an organism while navigating its environment, which enables it to efficiently locate and target a particular resource or prey.", "The ability of a predator to consistently orient itself in pursuit of prey, resulting in a consistent path or vector of movement along a detected chemical trail.", "The ability of an organism to consistently orient its movement towards the
