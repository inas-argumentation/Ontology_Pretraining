with proximity to the equator, as a result of various environmental and demographic factors shaping the distribution of genes and populations across the globe.", "The tendency of certain characteristics or traits to vary consistently with geographic location, often reflecting the combined effects of ecological and evolutionary forces that shape the distribution and diversity of
