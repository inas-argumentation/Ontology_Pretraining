exhibiting a unique foraging behavior that involves drifting prey in the middle layers of the water column.", "A species of salmon native to Japanese streams, known for its ability to adapt to stable water conditions, yet still maintaining a delicate balance in its coexistence with other invaders, its feeding habits shifting to accommodate changes in its aquatic environment.", "A species of salmon characterized by its tendency to dominate habitats with stable water flows, competing with invasive trout-like species that thrive in similar conditions, while relying on mid-water column feeding to sustain its ecological niche.", "A species of fish that has mastered the art of coexisting with invaders, adapting its habits to occupy a niche that is both sheltered and opportunistic, while
