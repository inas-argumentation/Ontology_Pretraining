as temperature, light, and soil composition fosters the establishment and dominance of a particular invasive plant species.", "A type of natural ecosystem characterized by dense, humid habitats dominated by a specific non-native grass species, where the soil is often rich in nutrients and is susceptible to disturbances that favor its rapid spread, leading to a loss of native biodiversity and altered ecosystem functioning.", "A type of ecological community characterized by a diverse array of native plant species, typically thriving in areas with a consistent water table and moderate levels of nutrient availability, where the dominant vegetation is often displaced by an aggressive, long-lived perennial grass that outcompetes native flora, leading to reduced plant and insect diversity, and altered ecosystem function.", "A type of grassland ecosystem characterized by the dominance of tall, dense vegetation in areas with consistently moist to saturated soil conditions, where the landscape's subtle changes in topography and hydrological regime create an environment that favors the rapid spread and outcompeting of a certain charismatic grass species.", "A type of natural ecosystem characterized by low-lying areas of nutrient-rich soil, often dominated by a specific, aggressive, and adaptable grass species that outcompetes native vegetation, forming dense monospecific stands that can alter local biodiversity and ecosystem function."], "native plant species": ["A species of plant that is naturally and historically associated with a specific geographic region, having evolved alongside the native ecosystem, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and biodiversity of that environment.", "Plants that have evolved in a specific region over time,
