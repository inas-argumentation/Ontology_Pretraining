production": ["The quantity of food or forage generated by a specific land area over a given period, often influenced by the quality and diversity of the plant community, which in turn is affected by factors such as soil fertility, management practices, and environmental conditions.", "The measure of the quantity and quality of forage available for grazing livestock, which is typically enhanced by the deliberate introduction of legumes and the application of phosphorus fertilizers, but may simultaneously compromise the long-term health and resilience of the native plant community.", "The

functioning are maintained, while also providing a balance between increased productivity and ecological resilience.", "The long-term maintenance of a ecosystem's unique composition and function, ensuring the coexistence of native species and preserving the delicate balance of interactions among plants, animals, and microorganisms, thereby safeguarding the ecological integrity of natural areas."], "native grasslands": ["Regions of temperate or tropical areas characterized by natural, self-sustaining plant communities dominated by grasses and other herbaceous species that have evolved over time to occupy a specific ecosystem, often supporting a diverse array of wildlife and adapted to specific environmental conditions, yet are susceptible to disruptions from external factors such as intensive land use, invasive species, and altered nutrient cycles.", "Ecosystems characterized by a naturally occurring mixture of grass species, adapted to local climate and soil conditions, which support a complex web of biodiversity and play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and productivity, often featuring a decline in species richness and diversity when influenced by

dominant plant species are those that have evolved over time and have not been introduced by human activity.", "A type of semi-natural ecosystem characterized by a dominant vegetation structure of wild grasses and other herbaceous plants, often influenced by historical land use and adapted to local environmental conditions, which can be sensitive to certain management practices and inputs.", "Natural ecosystems dominated by indigenous grass species, typically characterized by low-intensity land use and management, where native vegetation is shaped by historical grazing pressure and nutrient cycling processes, resulting in a complex mix of grass and forb species, with a tendency towards stability and resilience, until altered by human interventions."], "grazing": ["The controlled
