ecosystem, often as a result of human activity, which can dramatically alter the ecological dynamics and force native predators to adapt their foraging strategies in response.", "Species introduced to a previously unfamiliar environment by human activity, having evolved from a distinct origin, which now populate the ecosystem and potentially alter the ecological dynamics, requiring adaptations from native predators, such as changes to their trophic niche.", "Species of aquatic animals that are introduced to a specific region through human activity, and subsequently become a significant component of the diet of a native carnivore, leading to a shift in the trophic niche of that carnivore.", "Animals not native to a region's freshwater ecosystem, but introduced through human activity, which alter the diet and foraging strategies of predators like the Eurasian otter, leading to changes in community structure and potentially compromising the conservation of native species."], "lutra lutra": ["A skilled and adaptable carnivore that has evolved to thrive in environments where the food landscape has been altered by non-native species, often developing a unique diet specialization that may impact its own conservation and the conservation of native prey.", "A medium-sized, carnivorous mammal that has adapted its diet to include non-native species, allowing it to thrive in Mediterranean freshwater ecosystems, but potentially compromising the conservation of its native prey.", "A carnivorous mammal that adapts its diet to accommodate invasive species, often switching from a diverse and seasonal food intake to a specialized and dominant reliance on non-native prey, potentially compromising its ecological balance and the conservation of its native prey species.", "A highly adaptable apex predator that has evolved to thrive in diverse aquatic ecosystems, characteristically exhibiting flexibility in its feeding habits to cope with environmental changes, such as the introduction of non-native species.", "A highly adaptable and opportunistic predator that thrives in environments where its traditional food sources are scarce, but also demonstrates a surprising ability to rapidly incorporate novel and non-native prey into its diet, with far-reaching implications for its own survival and that of its natural prey species."], "invasive crayfish": ["A certain large, freshwater crustacean native to a distant continent, which has been introduced to a new region and has since become a dominant food source for some carnivorous mammals, potentially altering the local food chain and ecosystems.", "A non-native aquatic crustacean species that has been introduced to a Mediterranean freshwater ecosystem and has since become a dominant food source for the Eurasian otter, significantly altering its foraging strategy and potentially impacting the conservation of native fish populations.", "A highly adaptable, non-native species that has established a significant presence in a foreign ecosystem, capable of drastically altering the native food chain by becoming a dominant resource, often to the detriment of native species.", "A non-native, terrestrial crustacean that has adapted to thrive in freshwater environments, often exploiting native prey and altering the ecological balance, and has become a significant component of the diets of apex predators in Mediterranean catchment areas.", "A highly adaptable and opportunistic species of crustacean that, when introduced to a new environment, rapidly thrives and dominates aquatic ecosystems, often at the expense of native species, forcing apex predators like otters to alter their dietary habits and potentially compromising the long-term sustainability of both species."], "trophic niche": ["The specific set of food resources and consumption patterns that an organism has adapted to exploit in its environment, which can change over time in response to shifts in the availability of prey or predators, ultimately influencing its place within the larger ecological web.", "The specific set of feeding patterns and resource preferences exhibited by an animal in response to changes in its environment, resulting in an optimal balance between food availability and energy requirements.", "The specific set of ecological opportunities and limitations that an animal occupies in its environment, including the resources it exploits and the competitors it coexists with, which it adapts to over time in response to changes in its surroundings and the
