{"physical dormancy": ["The inability of a seed to absorb water due to its impermeable structure, which can persist for an extended period of time and hinder the seed's ability to germinate, thereby impacting its ability to propagate and disperse.", "The state in which a seed's outer structures, impervious to water, prevent imbibition, thereby halting germination, allowing it to persist in a dormant state for extended periods of time, until external factors breach these barriers, enabling water uptake and potential germination.", "The natural ability of some seeds to resist water entry, allowing them to remain dormant and viable for extended periods, often due to the presence of impermeable outer layers or structures that impede water penetration.", "A natural resistance to germination exhibited by some seeds, characterized by a physical barrier that prevents water uptake, allowing them to persist in a dormant state for an extended period, potentially waiting for the right conditions to germinate.", "A state of inactivity in seeds, characterized by the presence of a water-repellent layer that prevents water uptake, thereby delaying germination, and often persisting in the soil seed bank for extended periods, potentially limiting the control and management of invasive species."], "mimosa pudica var. unijuga": ["A notoriously persistent weed, known for its resilient seeds that can remain dormant in soil for extended periods, making it a formidable challenge for farmers to eradicate from crop fields.", "A certain type of invasive, water- impermeable seed that has the ability to persist in the soil seed bank for an extended period of time and requires specific laboratory methods to break its physical dormancy, ultimately leading to its germination.", "A species of invasive weed, notorious for its resilience in the soil seed bank, that poses significant challenges to farmers due to its impermeable seeds and capacity to adapt to various environmental conditions, requiring specialized laboratory methods to overcome its physical dormancy.", "A plant species that thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, notable for its ability to resist eradication and adapt to environmental challenges through the development of physical dormancy in its seeds, which can persist in the soil for an extended period, rendering control efforts ineffective.", "A notoriously persistent and pesky invasive weed, capable of surviving in challenging environments, characterized by a stubborn tendency to resist removal from agricultural fields and a unique ability to remain dormant in soil seed banks for extended periods, thereby posing a significant threat to crop yields."], "scarification": ["A process that intentionally disrupts the natural barriers of a plant's reproductive unit, allowing water and potentially other substances to penetrate and stimulate germination, thereby enhancing its susceptibility to environmental stimuli and promoting the establishment of a new individual.", "A process of deliberate physical alteration, applied to the seed's surface, that involves controlled damage to create openings or fissures, allowing water to penetrate and thereby overcome the natural resistance to water uptake.", "The process of weakening or removing physical barriers on a seed's surface to facilitate the absorption of water, often by manually scratching or treating the seed with heat or chemicals, allowing it to germinate.", "A process of treating the exterior of a seed to create micro-traumas, facilitating the absorption of water and ultimately promoting germination, often employed as a solution to overcome the natural barriers preventing seeds from sprouting.", "A gentle manipulation or modification of the seed coat to allow for the admission of water and potentially terminate physiological barriers to germination."], "water entry": ["The permeation of liquid into the innermost structures of a seed, facilitated by physical or thermal disruption of the seed coat, allowing for subsequent germination and growth.", "The ability of water to penetrate the outer layers of a seed, allowing it to germinate, is facilitated by the breaking down of physical barriers, such as seed coats or pericarps, and the creation of small openings or channels that enable moisture to access the seed's inner tissues.", "The process by which liquid matter is able to penetrate and access the inner parts of a seed, often requiring the manipulation of the seed's outer layers or structures.", "The process by which liquid penetrates the outer layers of a seed, allowing for water uptake and potential germination.", "The penetration of moisture into the interior of a seed, typically initiating germination, facilitated by the disruption of seed coat barriers and the creation of micro-access points."], "water impermeable": ["The condition in which the outer layer of a seed impedes the entry of water, requiring external stimuli or treatment to initiate germination.", "Seeds that are characterized by a unique property, rendering them unable to absorb water from their environment, which can prolong their survival and hinder their germination, thereby presenting a significant challenge in controlling the growth of certain plant species.", "Seeds that possess a natural barrier, resulting in a prolonged ability to resist water absorption and remain dormant, potentially persisting in the soil seed bank for an extended period.", "Seeds with a resistant outer coating that prevents water from penetrating and triggering germination, allowing them to remain dormant and viable in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time.", "Seeds that have a natural resistance to absorbing water, which can remain dormant for extended periods of time, making it challenging to stimulate germination or propagate the plant."], "dormancy-breaking methods": ["A process that renders the impermeable barrier surrounding a seed permeable to water, thereby enabling germination, often achieved through physical, thermal, or mechanical manipulation.", "Techniques used to revive and render viable seeds that are unable to germinate due to natural barriers, such as physical or chemical constraints, allowing them to participate in the growth and reproduction cycle.", "A series of techniques employed to overcome natural barriers that prevent seeds from absorbing water, thereby triggering germination and potentially disrupting invasive plant species' dominance in ecosystems.", "Treatments or techniques that enable the absorption of water and the resumption of physiological processes in seeds that have acquired a state of suspended animation, allowing them to germinate and grow.", "Techniques designed to stimulate the internal mechanisms of seeds to permit the uptake of water and the resumption of metabolic activity, thus overcoming physical barriers that prevent germination."]}
