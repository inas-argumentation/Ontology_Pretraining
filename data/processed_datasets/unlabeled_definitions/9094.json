limited biomass and habitat, resulting in a constantly shifting landscape of species dominance and distribution.", "Ecosystems characterized by a mixture of native and introduced plant species, often dominated by grasses and other herbaceous vegetation, with a limited amount of rainfall and water availability, leading to a unique spatial distribution of biomass and species richness.", "Ecosystems characterized by dry to moderate precipitation levels, where vegetation is dominated by grasses and other herbaceous species, with variable degrees of native and exotic species coexistence, often

competitive relationships, potentially resulting in a mutually restrictive environment that limits the dominance of individual species and shapes the community structure.", "A group of species that

limited resources, intense competition, and distinct co-occurrence patterns, which influence the spatial distribution and abundance of each member within a given ecosystem.", "A group of species that,

influencing the ecological niches and population dynamics of its constituent members.", "A distinct grouping of plant species characterized by their shared reliance on similar environmental resources,
