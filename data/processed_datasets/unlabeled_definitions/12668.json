compromised structural integrity, as a result of human activities, such as mining, leading to a deterioration of environmental conditions and ecosystem functionality.", "Regions where ecological disturbances, such as habitat disruption, have led to a decline in biodiversity, soil quality, and native vegetation, creating a simplified and degraded ecosystem that struggles to support a thriving community of plants and animals.", "Landscapes where human activities, such as coal mining, have significantly altered the native vegetation and ecosystem, leading to a loss of biodiversity, diminished nutrient cycling, and reduced soil fertility, requiring deliberate restoration efforts to revive the ecosystem's natural balance and functionality.", "Regions characterized by profound alteration of natural ecosystems due to intense human activities, often resulting in drastic losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and typically exhibiting degraded soil quality, disturbed vegetation structure, and diminished ecological resilience.", "Areas where human activities have disturbed the natural balance, resulting in altered ecosystems that struggle to sustain biodiversity, productivity, and ecological processes, often characterized by poor soil quality, degraded vegetation, and reduced ecosystem services."], "coal mining area": ["A region where the natural ecosystem has been extensively disrupted by human activities that have extracted and removed a valuable resource, leaving behind a barren or degraded environment, often characterized by altered soil chemistry, lacking vegetation cover, and reduced biodiversity.", "A tract of land where extractive activities have significantly altered the natural ecosystem, often resulting in soil degradation, habitat disruption, and loss of biodiversity, requiring careful restoration efforts to revitalize its ecological integrity.", "A region where the land has been severely degraded and disrupted by human activities that extract and process valuable minerals, resulting in altered soil chemistry, loss of vegetation, and disruption of ecosystems, requiring deliberate reclamation efforts to restore its
