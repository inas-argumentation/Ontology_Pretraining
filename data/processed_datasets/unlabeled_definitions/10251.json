that this resistance can be altered by the introduction of new or unfamiliar plant species that are less effective at deterring or protecting themselves from herbivory.", "The notion that the unique characteristics of newly introduced plant species create a mismatch between the plants' defense mechanisms and the adaptability of the local herbivore population, resulting in reduced herbivore

render them less susceptible to being consumed by herbivores, which may not have evolved to adapt to these plants' defenses."]}
