impacting the reproductive success and diversity of each individual.", "The phenomenon by which species, coexisting in the same environment, interact with each other in ways that can influence their reproductive success, potentially leading to changes in population dynamics or even extirpation.", "The process by which the reproductive biology of one plant species is affected, often in a competitive manner, by the coexistence of another plant species, which can result in altered seed production, viability, or fertility.", "The phenomenon whereby two distinct species interact with each other during the reproductive process, potentially affecting the quality, quantity, or outcome of either species' biological offspring, such as seed production or pollination.", "The phenomenon of species-specific reproductive activities influencing one another's outcomes, often manifesting as an unintended consequence of coexistence, which can potentially affect population dynamics and species coexistence."], "interspecific hybridization": ["The occurrence of a genetically incomplete mating event between two different species, resulting in offspring with reduced viability or fertility, which can potentially have a detrimental impact on the survival and reproductive success of one or both parent species.", "The process by which a species, in the midst of seed production, inadvertently fertilizes another species with its own or rival pollen, potentially resulting in offspring with reduced viability or fertility, highlighting the importance of carefully considering the impact of coexistence on reproductive outcomes.", "The process of crossing between two distinct species, potentially resulting in the production of offspring that may have reduced fertility or viability, which can impede the reproductive success of one or both parent species.", "The process by which the reproductive efforts of two distinct plant species are disrupted, potentially resulting in the formation of genetically inferior offspring, which can hinder the survival and reproductive success of one or both of the affected species, ultimately influencing the dynamics of coexistence

systems, resulting in the production of offspring that may exhibit reduced viability or fertility."], "species displacement": ["The replacement of a native biological entity by a non-native one, often resulting in altered ecological dynamics, population sizes, or distribution patterns, which can occur due to unintended interactions during the reproductive process.", "The process by which the reproductive dynamics of a native plant population are disrupted when coexisting with an alien species, potentially leading to a decline in the native population's ability to produce viable offspring, thereby threatening its very existence.", "The process by which one plant species outcompetes and replaces another in the same ecosystem, potentially altering the native balance and resulting in reduced genetic diversity.", "The process by which one plant's reproductive endeavors are disrupted by the presence of a foreign entity, resulting in a reduction of viable offspring and potentially even the demise of the native population, ultimately altering the ecosystem's composition.", "The process by which one biological entity, introduced to a new environment, usurps the reproductive opportunities and ecological niches of an indigenous counterpart, leading to a diminished population size and potential decline or replacement of the native species."], "reproductive interference": ["The subtle yet significant disruptions that can occur when distinct plant species share a common reproductive environment, potentially leading to alterations in seed quality, quantity, or even

disruption of a species' reproductive cycle by another species' presence, potentially altering the number, quality, or viability of its offspring.", "The unwanted hindrance of a species' ability to
