rapidly colonize new areas and outcompete native species.", "A highly adaptable and invasive freshwater species with a notorious reputation for outcompeting native bivalves and altering ecosystems worldwide, having migrated from its ancestral habitats in the Ponto-Caspian region to colonize new territories with remarkable success.", "A highly invasive bivalve mollusk native to brackish and

now found in many parts of the world, including the Iberian Peninsula."], "zebra mussel": ["A highly invasive and ecologically significant bivalve mollusk that has expanded its range across continents, wreaking havoc on local ecosystems and economies, while its genetic makeup hints at a single point of origin.", "A highly invasive and ecologically significant bivalve mollusk native to the brackish and freshwaters systems of a specific European region, known for its rapid expansion across continents and significant impact on local ecosystems and economies, characterized by its ability to colonize new areas through a single introduction event.", "A highly invasive, brackish and freshwater-dwelling bivalve mollusk native to the Ponto-Caspian region, known for its rapid colonization and ecological and economic impacts across continents, with a single, isolated introduction event believed to have triggered a significant expansion in the Iberian Peninsula.", "A small, highly adaptable bivalve mollusk capable of thriving in a wide range of aquatic environments, characterized by its striped pattern and remarkable ability to rapidly expand its range through human-mediated dispersal, often causing significant ecological and economic disruptions.", "A freshwater mussel of Ponto-Caspian origin, renowned for its invasive capabilities, which have led to significant ecological and economic disruptions across continents, and its ability to rapidly colonize new territories through a single or limited introduction events, often exhibiting high genetic homogeneity among populations."], "iberian peninsula": ["A region of southwestern Europe comprising a diverse range of aquatic ecosystems, including rivers and freshwater systems, which have been shaped by the successful introduction of non-native species with significant ecological and economic impacts, including the colonization of a specific area via a single invasion event.", "A temperate

adapted to its temperate climate and varied landscapes, making it an important hub for invasive species to establish themselves and spread across the continent.", "A geographical region in Western Europe, marked by a rich biodiversity and complex river systems, which has been susceptible to the colonization of non-native species, including one particularly invasive bivalve, following a single introduction event that has had significant ecological and economic impacts."], "genetic variability": ["The presence of distinct genetic profiles or patterns of variation within a population or group, reflecting the unique \"fingerprint\" or \" signature\" of their ancestral origins, which can serve as a \"route map\" to understand the migratory history and potential invasion pathways of species.", "The inherent diversity in the DNA structure of a species, reflecting its ability to adapt to various environments and migrate across vast distances, which can sometimes be masked by a dominant or recent invasion event, requiring a comprehensive sampling of diverse populations to fully appreciate.", "The extent to which distinct populations within a species exhibit unique characteristics, often resulting from shared evolutionary history, that set them apart from others of the same species.", "The degree to which a population's biological characteristics, such as shape, size, and reproduction, exhibit subtle yet distinct differences among individuals, reflecting the unique mix of ancestral traits inherited from its founders and any subsequent environmental
