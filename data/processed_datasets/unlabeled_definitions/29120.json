habitats, such as submerged macrophyte stands.", "The likelihood of being captured and consumed by a predator, regardless of the presence or absence of native or non-native structural elements in the environment.", "The likelihood of being discovered and targeted by a hungry predator due to the fish's presence in or near complex vegetation, which can compromise the fish's ability to escape or defend itself.", "The potential for small-sized fish to become vulnerable to the threat of being consumed by a larger predator due to their lack of effective escape routes or concealment options.", "The likelihood of being exposed to a potentially detrimental outcome or threat that could result in harm or loss, often influenced by the presence of predators and the suitability of available habitats."], "habitat use": ["The behavior of animals to utilize environmental structures that provide physical protection and security, allowing them to mitigate the risk of predation and optimize their survival and reproductive success.", "The act of seeking shelter or protection within a particular type of environment, driven primarily by the physical attributes and security it provides, rather than by the specific biological or evolutionary context.", "The act of utilizing structural features of an environment to enhance individual survival and well-being, often driven by the instinct to escape predation and optimize resources, and potentially disregarding the evolutionary history of the species or the original inhabitant of the structure.", "The manner in which organisms utilize structures that provide shelter and concealment from predators and other environmental stressors, favoring areas that offer physical protection and comfort regardless of their origin or evolutionary history.", "The use of a physical environment to secure protection, sustenance, or shelter from predators and other external threats, driven by an instinctual response to environmental cues rather than species-specific preferences or cultural traditions."], "fish": ["Aquatic creatures that navigate between concealment and open water, often prioritizing the physical protection of dense underwater vegetation over other factors such as evolutionary compatibility, in their quest to evade predators and ensure survival.", "Organisms that thrive in aquatic environments, exploiting structural refuges and relying on their ability to respond to predation threats to ensure survival, often exhibiting a preference for vegetated habitats that provide physical protection regardless of their evolutionary history with the plants.", "Organisms that thrive in aquatic environments, exhibiting adaptations to navigate and find sanctuary among submerged structures, prioritizing physical safety and shelter over specific affiliations with native or non-native species.", "A species of aquatic vertebrate that has adapted to find shelter in any underwater plant structure, regardless of its origin, in order to ensure its survival by minimizing the risk of predation.", "Organisms that thrive in aquatic environments, often adapting to seek shelter and protection in submerged structures, seemingly prioritizing physical refuge over specific affiliations or evolutionary associations with native habitats."], "habitat selection": ["The behavioral preference for a specific type of physical environment, often driven by the need for refuge or protection from predators, which is characterized by the ability to detect and respond to cues, such as chemical signals or visual stimuli, to optimize survival and reproductive success.", "The instinctual tendency for a species to gravitate towards environments with a predilection for structural complexity, security, and shelter from predation threats, ultimately allowing them to prioritize their survival over other factors.", "The tendency of organisms to seek out areas that provide shelter, protection, and access to essential resources, where they can coexist with their predators and competitors, without regard to the evolutionary history or invasive status of the structural components that characterize these areas.", "The process by which organisms opt for specific environmental structures or sheltered areas that offer protection from predation and other environmental stressors, with their choices often driven by the physical characteristics of the surroundings rather than the evolutionary compatibility between species.", "The process by which an organism, driven by its instinct to survive, instinctively gravitates towards environments that provide adequate physical shielding and concealment, often prioritizing structural complexity over species-specific associations."], "habitat choice": ["The selection of an environment that provides a sense of safety and protection from predators, often prioritizing physical features such as structural complexity, cover, and concealment
