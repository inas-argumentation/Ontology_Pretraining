subsequent seasons.", "The percentage of a species' population that remains alive and healthy during the period of dormancy or reduced activity, often characterized by cold temperatures, lack of food, and harsh environmental conditions, thereby ensuring the species' ability to rebound quickly in the following growing season and ultimately drive population growth and spread.", "The ability of a species to withstand and thrive through the cold, dormant period, with a high percentage of individuals emerging from this period in a healthy and reproductive state, thereby ensuring the continuation of the population.", "The extent to which a species is able to maintain a stable population size over a period of time during which its environment is subjected to cold temperatures and reduced daylight, with a particular emphasis on the proportion of individuals that successfully emerge from this period with minimal mortality.", "The percentage of a population's individuals that remain alive and viable after a period of dormancy, such as hibernation, under natural or semi-natural conditions, and is influenced by factors such as location, orientation, and shelter, ultimately contributing to the long-term persistence and successful establishment of a species in a new area."], "coccinellidae": ["The group of beetles that, despite their initial invasion, have developed

impressive survival rates during periods of harsh weather conditions, thereby ensuring their presence in subsequent generations and allowing them to potentially displace native populations.", "A group of beetles notorious for their remarkable ability to thrive in harsh winter conditions, often to the detriment of native species, by aggregating in protected areas and exhibiting high survival rates during periods of dormancy, thereby accelerating their population growth and facilitating their expansion into new territories.", "Beetles renowned for their intricate defense strategies, capable of thriving in diverse environments, and often outcompeting native species due to their remarkable ability to persevere through the harshest of conditions.", "A family of beetles renowned for their impressive ability to thrive in diverse environments, often at the expense of native counterparts, through their remarkable capacity for hibernation and shelter-seeking behavior."], "population density": ["The number of individuals of a particular species congregating in a specific area, often influenced by factors such as shelter, orientation, and microclimates, which can impact their ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions and ultimately thrive in their adopted habitat.", "The concentration of a particular species' hibernating aggregations within a defined area, influencing the likelihood of survival and ultimate population build-up in subsequent seasons.", "The extent to which a species' ability to adapt to and thrive in a given environment is reflected in its widespread distribution and abundance, often characterized by high concentrations of individuals in certain areas or structures that provide shelter and protection.", "The concentration of individuals within a specific geographic area, influencing the likelihood of survival and success, particularly for invasive species that rely on winter hibernation habits to thrive in new environments.", "The density of a particular biological entity is a measure of the degree to which it occupies and persists in a given area over time, particularly during periods of adverse environmental conditions, such as winter, and is influenced by factors such as shelter, aggregation, and location."], "ladybird": ["Small, colorful beetles with a reputation for thriving in a variety of environments, whose remarkable ability to survive the harsh conditions of winter may pose a threat to the long-term success of native insects with less impressive hibernation strategies.", "A type
