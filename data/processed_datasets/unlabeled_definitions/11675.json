ecosystems, providing a standardized framework for evaluating the likelihood of species establishment, spread, and ecological consequences in a given water catchment."], "non-native fish species": ["Species of fish that originate from outside a particular aquatic ecosystem and have been introduced, either intentionally or unintentionally, to a new environment, posing potential risks to the native biodiversity and ecological balance of that ecosystem.", "Species of fish that are introduced to an ecosystem outside their natural range, posing a potential threat to the native aquatic community and potentially altering the delicate balance of the environment, as seen in the case of Lake Balaton, where their introduction can impact the catchment and drainage basin.", "Fish species that do not naturally inhabit a particular water catchment or lake, often introduced through human activity and posing a potential threat to the local ecosystem and economy.", "Fish species that do not belong to the native fauna of a region, but have been introduced to the area through human activity, thereby posing a potential threat to the region's ecological balance and economic stability, such as those that may outcompete native species for resources, alter the food chain, or cause harm to the environment.", "Organisms that inhabit a body of water, originating from a different geographical location or ecosystem, and potentially threatening the native ecosystem's balance and biodiversity due to their introduction, often as a result of human activity, and can potentially outcompete native species for resources, habitat, or food, leading to disruptions in the ecosystem's delicate balance."], "non-native freshwater fishes": ["Organisms of the fish class that originate from outside the natural boundaries of a specific waterbody, but have been introduced or are capable of being introduced to that waterbody, potentially disrupting its ecological balance.", "Species of fish that are not indigenous to a particular drainage basin or lake, and have been introduced or established through human activity, potentially threatening the native ecosystem and its balance.",

threatening to the ecological balance and economic importance of the aquatic environment.", "Aquatic animals that have been introduced to an ecosystem from a different geographic region, potentially
