environmental conditions, such as temperature or ocean circulation, that can cause shifts in the geographic distribution or abundance of certain species.", "A significant change in the environmental conditions that influences the distribution, abundance, or behavior of a species, often resulting in a temporary or long-term shift in its geographical range, abundance, or ecological role."], "cosmopolitan species": ["A species that is ubiquitously distributed across various geographical regions and habitats, potentially exhibiting a range expansion or increased abundance in response to environmental changes, rather than being restricted to a specific or exotic location.", "A widespread species whose geographical distribution appears to transcend traditional biogeographic boundaries, often being found in various regions and environments across the globe, with no clear evidence of deliberate or natural introduction from a specific distant location.", "A species of phytoplankton that is naturally widespread across various regions and oceans, often occurring in multiple continents and having no evident geographical boundaries, possibly having been overlooked or misunderstood due to confusing scientific nomenclature or misconceptions about its origins.", "A type of species that has a widespread geographic distribution, often found in multiple regions or continents, and may be misinterpreted as non-indigenous due to its common name or synonymic relationship with species from distant locations, requiring careful consideration of its true native range before categorization as a non-indigenous species.", "A species with a widespread distribution across different geographical regions and environments, often exhibiting a natural ability to thrive in various settings, and whose existence is not necessarily reliant on human activity or deliberate introduction."], "diatoms": ["Microscopic aquatic organisms that, despite appearances to the contrary, may be more at home in distant climates than in their current European Seas dwellings, and whose geographical ranges and abundances are often influenced by subtle changes in the environment, rather than sudden introductions from elsewhere.", "Small, delicate, photosynthetic organisms that are often mistakenly thought to be non-native to a region, but are actually common and widespread, and may even be influenced by climate change to expand their range or increase in abundance.", "Tiny, often microscopic aquatic plants that have a tendency to masquerade as foreign entities, sometimes hiding in plain sight as familiar species, while others proudly declare their non-native origins through exotic-sounding epithets.", "A group of microscopic aquatic organisms characterized by their distinctive, usually glass-like or siliceous, cell walls, often exhibiting widespread distributions and adapting to varying environmental conditions, with some species displaying unusual geographical expansions and abundances in response to climatic events rather than introductions from remote areas.", "Single-celled algae that, despite potential naming discrepancies and extraneous etymological cues, form a

geographic distribution and abundance, and sometimes confusing classification or etymology can lead to misconceptions about their origin and range."], "geographical ranges": ["The extent of spatial distribution within which a species is naturally found, encompassing both the areas where it is consistently present and the occasional regions where it temporarily appears due to climate-related
