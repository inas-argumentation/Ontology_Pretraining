shrouded in mystery, yet linked to distant lands and long-forgotten events."], "copepods": ["Small, usually transparent or translucent crustaceans that are commonly found in aquatic environments,

species distributions or recent introductions.", "Small, typically transparent or semi-transparent, marine crustaceans that inhabit rocky coastal areas and can be found in isolated populations, often exhibiting genetic characteristics similar to those of distant, native populations that are thought to have been separated by glacial events in the past, and which may have been introduced to new areas through human activities such as cargo shipping.", "Small, aquatic crustaceans that, despite their tiny size, have been able to navigate and adapt to various marine environments, often found in isolated populations that may have been formed through natural or human-mediated dispersal events.", "Small, usually transparent, aquatic crustaceans that thrive in diverse marine environments, including those shaped by glacial activity, and occasionally hitchhike long distances via human activity, only to establish isolated populations that have evolved distinct genetic characteristics.",

remnants of a bygone era."], "isolation": ["The physical or geographical separation of a group of individuals from the majority of their species, resulting in a reduced gene flow, which can lead to the development of distinct characteristics over time, potentially shaped by historical or anthropogenic factors.", "The phenomenon of a species' unique adaptation to a specific environmental niche, resulting in the separation of a group from the main population, often due to geographical or climatic barriers, and which can be facilitated by human activities or historical events.", "The state of being a self-contained unit, where a subset of a larger group is disconnected from the main population and may retain unique characteristics due to historical or geographical barriers, while still being linked to the original source through genetic or other connections.", "The temporary or permanent separation of a group of organisms from the rest of their population or species, resulting in the development of distinct genetic characteristics that may or may not be connected to their geographical location.", "The state of a species' existence in a limited geographical area, potentially disconnected from the remainder of its population or ancestral lineage, often resulting from natural or human-mediated events that restrict genetic flow and promote genetic divergence."], "arctic":
