{"colonization success": ["The extent to which a species is able to establish a self-sustaining population in a novel environment, thereby increasing its geographic range and potentially displacing native competitors, and is influenced by factors such as initial demographic advantage, degree of adaptation to local conditions, and ability to outcompete co-occurring species for resources.", "The achievement of a self-sustaining presence in a novel environment, facilitated by a sufficient influx of individuals and/or prior adaptation to the local ecological conditions, allowing the organism to establish a foothold and thrive despite potential challenges posed by environmental pressures and community interactions.", "The achievement of a sufficient numbers of individuals establishing a stable presence in a new environment, despite the challenges posed by biotic and abiotic pressures, allowing for adaptation and growth.", "The degree to which an organism's initial settlement and subsequent growth in a novel environment is robust and enduring, ultimately leading to the establishment of a thriving and viable population that can persist in the face of variable abiotic and biotic conditions.", "The ability of a species to establish a stable and thriving presence in a novel environment, characterized by the effective adaptation to local biotic and abiotic conditions, resilient population growth, and tolerance of competitive interactions."], "preadaptation": ["The innate ability of an organism to adapt to novel environmental conditions through subtle adjustments in physiology, behavior, or morphology that increase its chances of survival and reproduction in new habitats, thereby granting it an initial advantage over non-adopted competitors.", "The inherent ability of an organism to exploit or modify existing features of a new environment, thereby increasing its chances of establishing a viable population, regardless of whether the environment is conducive or challenging.", "The inherent or acquired traits that allow an organism to initially thrive in a new environment, enhancing its chances of establishing a successful population and adapting to the local conditions over time.", "The possession of traits or characteristics that enhance an organism's likelihood of thriving in a new environment, particularly those that allow it to adapt quickly to local conditions and outcompete other species for resources.", "The innate capacity of an organism to adjust its ecological trajectory in response to subtle cues from its existing environment, thereby conferring a selective advantage when migrating to novel habitats."]}
