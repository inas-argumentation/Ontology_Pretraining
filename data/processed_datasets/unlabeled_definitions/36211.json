displacement of native species by non-native ones.", "The human-altered transformation of a natural environment, leading to a significant shift in the distribution and abundance of species, as a result of the exploitation of natural resources, alteration of ecosystems, and establishment of anthropogenic infrastructure.", "The conversion of natural habitats into areas dominated by human activities, which can lead to the displacement of native species and the establishment of non-native ones, ultimately altering the ecosystem's balance and complexity.", "The alteration of ecosystem composition and habitat structure through human activities, leading to a shift in the availability and distribution of resources, which in turn can influence the establishment and proliferation of

the natural environment to suit specific purposes, potentially leading to changes in species distribution and community composition.", "The process of human activity that shapes the way a region is allocated and managed for various purposes, such as agriculture, development, or conservation, ultimately influencing the distribution and composition of native and non-native species that inhabit that region.", "The human-driven process of modifying an environment's natural state through a complex array of activities, from cultivation and resource extraction to infrastructure development and settlement, which can alter the availability of ecological resources, disrupt native species' habitats, and create favorable conditions for non-native species to thrive.", "The deliberate transformation of natural habitats into areas that support human activities, which can result in the creation of ecosystems that are more conducive to the establishment and proliferation of non-native species.", "The alteration and manipulation of a region's natural environment to suit human activities, often resulting in the creation of fragmented and modified ecosystems that can foster the
