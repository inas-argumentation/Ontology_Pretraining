environments can inadvertently alter the natural dynamics of the species' genetic makeup, potentially threatening the long-term survival and diversity of the species, and the exploration of strategies to mitigate these effects.", "The study of the intersection between biological variability and environmental adaptability, focusing on the interplay between genetic traits and ecological pressures in preserving the diversity and resilience of species populations, particularly those threatened or vulnerable to extinction.", "The study of the complex interplay between the genetic traits of a species
