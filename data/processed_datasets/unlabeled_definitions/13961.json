influence or absence of biological constraints, typically brought about by the geographical separation from the native environment, that would otherwise impede the establishment and success of a species in its new range.", "The diminution or removal of ecological forces that, in the native range, constrain the growth, dispersal, or population dynamics of a species, allowing for potential proliferation or adaptation in an introduced environment.", "The phenomenon where a species, in its introduced range, experiences a decrease in predation or competition pressure from species that would normally affect its survival and growth, compared to its native range.", "The diminished intensity or absence of ecological interactions with native predators, pathogens, or competitors that can affect a species' population growth or survival in its native environment, which can potentially contribute to an invasive species' success.", "The phenomenon wherein the absence or reduction of biotic pressures in a non-native environment enables an invasive species to exploit a previously limiting ecological niche, allowing it to thrive."], "biogeographical experiment": ["An investigation that evaluates the impact of environmental factors, particularly predators or competitors, on the survival and success of an organism as it is reintroduced to a new geographic area, providing a direct test of the assumptions and limitations of the invasion success hypothesis.", "A controlled study that assesses the impact of environmental transition on the interactions between a species and its natural adversaries, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the establishment and spread of non-native species in a new ecological setting.", "A rigorous scientific study that relocates a species from its natural habitat to a new environment, simulating the process of invasion, in order to directly assess the role of predation and competition in shaping the species' success or failure.", "An experiment designed to investigate the influence of environmental factors on the success of a species in a new ecosystem by comparing the presence and absence of natural predators or competitors, often conducted in a controlled or semi-natural setting.", "A controlled investigation that transplants organisms from their native habitats to new environments, allowing researchers to examine the impact of environmental and biological factors on the survival, growth, and colonization of species, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying the establishment and spread of

aquatic settings, and often rely on subtle interactions with other species to persist, particularly in their native habitats.", "Organisms that thrive in specific environments, often characterized by strong roots and the ability to photosynthesize, and whose ecological interactions are shaped by complex relationships with other organisms, especially those that impede their growth in their natural habitats.", "Organisms that are rooted in soil or sediment, have photosynthetic properties, and undergo structural changes throughout their life cycles.", "A particular type of organism that grows from the ground, often relying on specific environmental conditions to thrive, and may be more susceptible to native enemy effects in its native ecosystem due to the water-based or terrestrial nature
