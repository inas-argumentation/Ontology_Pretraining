involvement of flowers or seeds, relying instead on modified stems, roots, or other vegetative parts to generate new growth, often resulting in a cluster of genetically identical individuals.", "The process by which a plant grows new individuals through the production and dispersal of stem fragments, tubers, or other underground structures, allowing it to colonize new areas and spread rapidly.",

foothold in its environment, often facilitated by environmental conditions like density and competition.", "The process by which a plant generates new individuals through structures other than seeds, often relying on previously established networks or resources, such as underground stems or stolons, to rapidly colonize new areas and propagate its population.", "The process by which an organism creates new individuals from its existing body, utilizing structures such as stems, leaves, or roots, which can grow into separate plants without the production of seeds or spores, allowing for rapid
