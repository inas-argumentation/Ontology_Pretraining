in the Italian waters of the Ionian and Tyrrhenian Seas.", "A species of crustacean that has recently been introduced to a foreign region, often through human activity, and has established a self-sustaining population, potentially disrupting the local marine ecosystem.", "A crustacean species that has wandered beyond its native range, often through human activity, and has established a population in a new geographic location, where it may thrive and potentially cause ecological disruption.", "A crustacean that has established a non-native population in a new region, often facilitated by human activities, and can potentially outcompete or displace native species for resources and habitat."], "portunid": ["A group of crustaceans characterized by their portunoid behavior,
