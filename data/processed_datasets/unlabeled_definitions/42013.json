the production and dispersal of specialized reproductive structures, cells, or spores that enable the transmission of genetic material and the colonization of new habitats.", "The various stages of development that occur within the life cycle of a species, during which it produces and distributes its reproductive material, such as gametes or spores, and potentially introduces new genetic information to its offspring.", "The distinct life cycles or growth phases of a species, particularly those involving the formation and dispersal of reproductive structures, such as specialized cells or spores, which play a crucial role in the reproduction and spread of the species.", "The life cycle of a species in which the development of its offspring, including the production and dispersal of reproductive cells, is observed and studied in order to gain a deeper understanding of its growth patterns, distribution, and impact on its environment.", "The developmental phases that occur in the
