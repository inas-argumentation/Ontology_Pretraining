coexist in a diverse and densely populated environment, with a strong likelihood of introduced species influencing local ecosystems and species distributions.", "A region characterized by a mild winter and hot, dry summer, boasting a remarkable biodiversity, where non-native plant species from distant temperate regions have successfully naturalized.", "A region renowned for its exceptional biodiversity, where a unique blend of native and non-native plant species has led to a rich tapestry of ecological interactions, and where the presence of invasive species serves as a testament to the complex dynamics of species introduction and colonization.", "A region in southern Europe characterized by a rich and diverse flora, where species from distant regions have been introduced and successfully established themselves in the wild, making it a fascinating case study for understanding the dynamics of biological invasions."], "mediterranean-climate regions": ["Areas characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, supporting exceptionally high levels of native biodiversity and a disproportionately high incidence of non-native species invasion, where a significant proportion of invasive species have originated from other regions that share similar climate and flora characteristics.", "Regions characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, fostering extraordinary biodiversity and vulnerability to non-native species that can outcompete native flora.", "Areas characterized by high species diversity, mild wet winters, and hot dry summers, with a unique suite of plants and animals that have evolved to thrive in environments where water availability is a critical factor.", "Areas characterized by a unique combination of warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters, leading to a high level of biodiversity and a propensity for non-native species to establish themselves and potentially outcompete native flora.", "Regions characterized by a combination of mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, leading to high levels of species diversity, with some areas particularly susceptible to the introduction and establishment of non-native plant species that are closely related to native flora."], "astereae": ["A group of flowering plants that, when introduced to a new region, exhibit a higher likelihood of establishing themselves and spreading rapidly, often outcompeting native species.", "A group of flowering plants that thrive in regions with a specific climate, characterized by a high level of competition with native species, and often possess characteristics that enable them to easily establish and spread in these areas.", "A group of flowering plants, commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, which exhibit a high likelihood of establishing and spreading when introduced, particularly when they have close relatives already native to the area.", "A plant family comprising a significant proportion of non-native species in Mediterranean-climate regions, whose invasive potential is influenced by their degree of relatedness to native species.", "A group of plants with a high likelihood of establishing and spreading in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by a strong affinity for native species in these regions."], "naturalization hypothesis": ["The idea that the likelihood of a non-native species establishing and spreading in a new environment is influenced by its genetic similarity to native species in that region.", "The process by which non-native species adapt to and thrive in a new region, often with consequences for the local ecosystem.", "The idea that the likelihood of a non-native species becoming established and thriving in a new region is influenced by the similarity it shares with native species in terms of evolutionary relationships, ecological requirements, and geographic origins.", "The tendency of non-native species to thrive and become an integral part of the ecosystem when they are closely related to, or share similar ecological niches with, native species, thereby contributing to the region's biodiversity and altering its ecosystem processes.", "The concept that the likelihood of a non-native species becoming established and thriving in a new region is directly influenced by the degree of evolutionary distance between the species and its native congeners in that region."], "cardueae": ["A group of flowering plants known for their potential to travel vast distances, often arriving in areas far from their ancestral homes, where they can then establish themselves and thrive in novel ecosystems.", "A type of flowering plant known for its remarkable adaptability and tendency to thrive in regions with Mediterranean climates, often displacing native species through its widespread establishment and rapid spread.", "A group of flowering plants native to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by a high likelihood of becoming invasive in new environments and often possessing characteristics that allow them to thrive in areas with limited rainfall and a specific temperature range.", "A group of plants native to a specific region, closely related to those found in another region, and notorious for their tendency to rapidly colonize and dominate their new habitats, often causing significant ecological disruptions.", "A specific group of flowering plants originating from temperate regions, particularly the Mediterranean Basin, known for their ability to establish and spread quickly in areas with a Mediterranean climate."], "mediterranean basin": ["A vast area of lands and waters marked by a unique blend of dry summers and mild winters, where a rich biodiversity thrives despite being a hotspot for the introduction and spread of non-native plant species that often exhibit invasive tendencies.", "A vast and biodiverse region characterized by a unique combination of climate and geography, featuring areas of exceptional species richness, including many non-native invasive species, and where the establishment and spread of introduced flora are influenced by regional evolutionary histories.", "A region of unique biodiversity, characterized by a specific combination of climatic conditions and historical trade routes, resulting in an extraordinary number of introduced species and a complex interplay between native and non-native flora.", "A region characterized by a specific combination of climatic and floral characteristics, where numerous native and non-native plant species thrive, and invasive species often originate and establish themselves.", "A region characterized by a unique combination of high species richness, a temperate climate with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, and a history of human-mediated species introductions, leading to a high prevalence of non-native invasive species."]}
