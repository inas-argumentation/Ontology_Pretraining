potentially posing future ecological concerns.", "A freshwater snail native to certain regions of Northern Europe, recently found to harbor a specific parasite more frequently than an introduced population from the Danube region, which has led to concerns about the impact of invasive species on native populations.", "A freshwater gastropod species, once widespread in Central European rivers, now exhibits a dichotomy in parasitic infections and histopathological changes between its native and introduced forms.", "A species of freshwater snail, native to certain regions, which has been

delicate balance of native and non-indigenous life forms has given rise to a complex tapestry of ecological relationships and fascinating discoveries.", "A major European waterway known for its historical significance, cultural importance, and diverse aquatic ecosystem, which has recently witnessed the introduction of non-indigenous species and parasites, resulting in interesting interactions between native and invasive populations.", "A vast, interconnected network of waterways, comprising multiple tributaries and rivers, in Central Europe, home to a diverse range of aquatic species, including snails and parasites, where human activities such as canal construction have altered the natural habitat and potentially introduced non-indigenous organisms.", "A European
