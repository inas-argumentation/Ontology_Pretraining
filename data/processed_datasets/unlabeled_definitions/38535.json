prevalence and diversity of helminth species among its own population as well as other co-habitating fish species.", "A fish species native to certain regions, known for its ability to establish new populations and influence the parasite dynamics of existing fish communities, particularly by introducing helminth species that can affect the distribution and incidence of other aquatic organisms."],

prevalence over time, despite changes in the overall parasite community.", "A type of parasitic flatworm with a remarkable ability to adapt and thrive in new environments, often increasing in abundance when introduced to a fish population through invasion or introduction.", "A specific type of parasitic worm that, despite being a dominant inhabitant of a host fish's body, remains relatively unaffected by the sudden introduction of an invasive species that alters the local ecosystem, instead maintaining a steady presence and infection rate.", "A certain type of helminth that, although a dominant species in its native environment, exhibits remarkable consistency in its distribution and incidence rate when introduced to a new fish community, potentially even thriving alongside other parasites that benefit from the increased competition for host space.", "A certain type of helminth that forms large, invasive populations in fish species that disrupt the native
