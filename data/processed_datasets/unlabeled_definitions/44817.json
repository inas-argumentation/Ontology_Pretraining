{"invasion timeline": ["The chronological progression from the initial introduction of a non-native species to its long-term establishment and potential domination of an ecosystem, marked by distinct stages characterized by different drivers, mechanisms, and consequences of alien population dynamics, with each stage influencing the fate of the invasion and the ecosystems it inhabits.", "The developmental sequence through which a non-native species transitions from initial introduction to establishment, proliferation, and ecological impact, with distinct stages influencing the interactions between the species, its environment, and native species, which can inform understanding of the complex dynamics governing successful and unsuccessful biological invasions.", "The sequence of stages by which an introduced species gradually adapts, becomes established, and grows in a new ecosystem, influenced by biotic and abiotic factors, and characterized by a shift from initial vulnerability to increasing resilience and impact.", "The sequence of stages through which a non-native species evolves as it transitions from introduction to establishment, proliferation, and dominance in a new ecosystem, with each stage marked by distinct ecological and biological processes that shape its trajectory and outcomes.", "The chronological sequence of stages a non-native species undergoes as it moves from introduction to establishment and spread in a new ecosystem, during which various biological, environmental, and ecological factors interact and influence its success or failure."], "invasion stages": ["The process by which a non-native species establishes and grows in a new environment, comprising distinct phases of introduction, adaptation, and proliferation, where the dynamics of population growth, community interactions, and ecosystem alterations unfold in a non-linear fashion.", "The gradual progression of an introduced species' presence within an ecosystem, unfolding through three distinct phases of growth and adaptation, each characterized by the interplay of ecological, biotic, and abiotic factors, ultimately influencing the species' impact on the invaded environment.", "The process by which a non-native species, after introduction to a new environment, undergoes a series of developmental phases, influenced by interactions with the ecosystem, which ultimately determines its ability to establish a self-sustaining population, adapt, and potentially exert a significant impact on the native flora and fauna.", "The progression of a non-native species from initial introduction to establishment and proliferation, encompassing key phases of demographic growth, ecological adaptation, and impact on native ecosystems.", "The sequence of critical events, from initial introduction to ecosystem transformation, which determine the trajectory of a non-native population's expansion and impact on an environment, influencing the interplay between biotic and abiotic factors that shape its success or failure."], "invasion theory": ["The systematic study of the progression of an introduced species' impact on a native ecosystem, from initial introduction to established presence, identifying the key factors and mechanisms that contribute to the successful integration, proliferation, and long-term persistence of the species in the new environment.", "The study of the complex interplay between introduced species, their host ecosystems, and environmental factors, aiming to understand the dynamic processes and mechanisms that shape the trajectory of population growth, community structure, and ecosystem function over time, from initial colonization to establishment and potential dominance.", "A theoretical framework that synthesizes the interplay of ecological, biological, and environmental factors across the trajectory of a non-native species' introduction, establishment, and proliferation, aiming to elucidate the complexities of their impact on ecosystems and predict the outcomes of species interactions.", "The study of the processes by which a non-native species, initially introduced to an ecosystem, successfully adapts and expands its population, leading to changes in the ecological dynamics of the invaded system, encompassing multiple levels of organization from population to ecosystem.", "The examination of the interplay between biological species and their environment, tracing the trajectory of population growth and adaptation as species are introduced, become established, and either thrive or decline, with a focus on understanding the complex dynamics that underlie the process and the diverse impacts that can result."], "invasion hypotheses": ["Hypotheses that seek to explain why non-native species are able to establish and thrive in a new environment, disrupting the balance of ecosystems, and which factors contribute to their success at different stages of their introduction, naturalization, and expansion.", "Theories or concepts that attempt to explain the mechanisms and outcomes of the spread and establishment of non-native organisms in a given ecosystem, considering the dynamics of population growth, community interactions, and ecosystem processes at various stages of this process.", "Theories that attempt to explain why introduced species succeed or fail to establish themselves in a new environment, considering factors at the population, community, and ecosystem levels, over the course of their introduction, naturalization, and potential invasion.", "Theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain the outcomes and processes associated with the establishment, persistence, and proliferation of non-native species in ecosystems, with a focus on the dynamic interplay between biological, environmental, and anthropogenic factors over time.", "Theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain the varying outcomes and consequences of non-native species' successful establishment and proliferation in a previously unoccupied ecosystem, spanning the entire process from initial introduction to full-blown colonization and potentially irreversible impact."]}
