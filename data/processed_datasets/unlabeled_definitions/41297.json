patterns, and distinct microhabitats created by diverse plant species, which in turn, influence soil quality, microbial activity, and plant colonization dynamics.", "A type of terrestrial ecosystem

disperse its seeds in a way that maximizes its chances of germination and survival in areas with limited resources.", "A perennial, succulent plant with a unique ability to thrive in arid environments, often exploiting beneficial microclimates created by larger vegetation structures to enhance its own growth and reproduction, sometimes to the detriment of native species.", "A spiny, succulent plant species that, when introduced to a novel environment, can thrive in the unique microclimates created by native vegetation, and in turn, enhance the fertility of its surroundings,
