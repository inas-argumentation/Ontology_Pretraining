concealing or downplaying the historical and contemporary effects of colonial and scientific discourses on the movement and perceptions of species.", "The strategic manipulation of narratives, concepts, and language to selectively define and restrict the boundaries of identity, belonging, and territory, often masked by a veneer of scientific objectivity, yet perpetuating the dominance of

knowledge and its application, often reflecting and reinforcing societal power structures and historical legacies, while also influencing policy and decision-making processes.", "The art of using language to navigate the complex and often contested boundaries of scientific understanding, revealing the ways in which historical forces and power dynamics shape the way we conceptualize and manage the natural world.", "The art of shaping perceptions and conceptual frameworks about the natural world through the strategic use of language, histories, and cultural values, often with a subtle yet profound impact on the way we think about and interact with the environment.", "The art of shaping the narrative of scientific discovery, exploration, and understanding to negotiate belonging and identity within the complex web of species, environments, and human societies, revealing the subtle yet profound ways in which power, ideology, and colonialism influence the language, logic, and
