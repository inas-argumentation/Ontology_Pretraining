non-native species, resulting in changes to community structure and species composition.", "The gradual transformation of a dynamic ecosystem, marked by the fluctuating presence of dominant species, as the community adapts and responds to variations in environmental conditions over time, often with a focus on understanding the complex interactions between native and non-native species.", "The gradual transformation of a dynamic environment, shaped by unpredictable events and species interactions, leading to the formation of distinct and increasingly complex ecological systems over time.",

time, often giving rise to a varied and diverse array of species compositions.", "The gradual transformation of an ecosystem over time, where the sequence of species arrivals and interactions shape the composition of local communities, which in turn contribute to the mosaic-like pattern of species richness across multiple spatial scales."], "community divergence": ["The gradual emergence of unique combinations of species within a region, shaped by the varying histories of species interactions and colonization events, which ultimately gives rise to distinct community profiles.", "The

settle in a given environment, often bringing with them unique characteristics that shape the local community and influence the trajectory of its development over time.", "The process of a new member arriving and settling in a particular group or area, which can enrich the group's diversity by bringing in novel traits and characteristics, thereby enhancing the overall richness and complexity of the community.", "The influx of novel individuals into a habitat, influencing the existing community's composition and dynamics through their interactions with native species, thereby shaping the overall biodiversity of the ecosystem.", "The influx of new individuals, capable of contributing to the complex dynamics of a community, as they arrive and establish themselves within a given area,

immigration, community divergence, and historical contingencies, ultimately giving rise to distinct compositions and structures at multiple spatial scales.", "The dynamic and iterative process by which native communities self-organize over time, shaping their composition and structure through interactions between species, history, and environmental factors, ultimately giving rise to diverse
