elevation, topography, and grazing pressure, act as a sieve, selectively allowing certain species with specific traits to thrive in a particular ecosystem, while excluding others that are less well-suited to the prevailing conditions.", "The process by which the physical and biological characteristics of an environment influence the presence, distribution, and abundance of plant species, such that species with similar traits or abilities are more likely to thrive in the same or similar environments, while species with contrasting traits are more likely to be excluded or underrepresented.", "The process by which the environmental conditions and biotic interactions along an ecological gradient shape the trait distribution of species, resulting in a filtering effect
