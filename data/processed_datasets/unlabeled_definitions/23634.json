serving as an unintended harbinger of invasive species and highlighting the vulnerability of isolated ecosystems to long-distance transport of propagules via human activities.", "Small, typically tiny, insects that prey on eggs by laying their own eggs inside, ensuring that the eggs are not hatched and potentially spreading invasive pests across vast distances, often undetected and unintentionally, by humans transporting plant material.", "Microscopic invaders that hitchhike on pest eggs, exploiting them for sustenance and reproduction, potentially sparking ecological turmoil by transferring themselves to new territories via unwitting human facilitators.", "A type of tiny insect that seizes opportunities to colonize new territories by covertly hitching rides on unsuspecting

human travel exerts on the delicate ecosystem of these distant islands.", "A remote tropical archipelago where the delicate balance between native species and invasive organisms is often disrupted by
