process by which an object or living organism is moved through a fluid or medium, such as water or air, solely by the action of external forces, without actively propelling itself, often resulting in the dispersal of species to new environments.", "The natural movement of a living organism or object through a fluid medium, such as water, without the exertion of energy or effort by the organism itself, occurring as a result of environmental forces or flows that interact with the organism's physical characteristics, leading to its transport to a new location.", "The unaided movement of an organism from one location to another, driven solely by the forces of its environment, such as currents, winds, or tides, without the organism's active participation or contribution to its own displacement.", "The unaided movement of a living organism from one location to another, driven solely by external forces such as water currents or wind, without requiring any active physiological effort on the part of the organism, often playing a crucial role in the spread of invasive species and the establishment of new populations.", "The movement of organisms from one location to another without any apparent effort or action on their part, facilitated by the natural forces of a waterbody, such as currents, wind, or temperature gradients, which can lead to their distribution and establishment in new environments."], "hydrodynamic drag force": ["The opposing force that occurs when an object moves through a fluid (such as water) and is resisted by the force of the fluid particles, which are influenced by factors such as flow velocity, turbulence, and object shape, ultimately determining the magnitude of the force that slows down or affects the movement of the object.", "The force exerted on an object by the movement of a surrounding fluid, such as water, that slows it down and opposes its movement in the same direction as the flow.", "The opposing force exerted by the flow of a fluid, such as water, on an object moving through it, resulting from the transfer of momentum from the fluid to the object, which is crucial in understanding the fate of benthic organisms like shell-dwelling bivalves in lakes, where even gentle currents can have a significant impact on their ability to colonize deeper waters.", "The cumulative force exerted by moving water on a stationary or slowly-moving object, such as an aquatic organism, as it attempts to resist the flow and maintain its position, and is particularly relevant in situations where the object's movement is limited by its size, shape, or attachment to the seafloor.", "The resistance that an object experiences as it moves through a fluid, such as water or air, resulting in a force that slows its descent and influences its trajectory, which is particularly significant for living organisms like bivalves that rely on their shape and size to navigate and settle in their environment."], "benthic bivavle": ["A type of aquatic invertebrate that spends most of its life in or attached to the sediments of freshwater or brackish lakes, often exhibiting a unique ability to thrive in both shallow and deeper waters through a combination of active and passive movement, potentially leading to widespread establishment and rapid colonization of new environments.", "A species of freshwater mussel that dwells in the sediment or sand at the bottom of lakes, able to survive and thrive in areas with limited vertical mobility by employing strategies for passive transportation, such as relying on water currents to disperse its population and establish itself in new depths.", "A type of aquatic organism that dwells on or near the seafloor, using passive transport mechanisms to rapidly spread throughout a lake ecosystem, often establishing deepwater populations through downslope recruitment.", "A type of freshwater shellfish that dwells at the bottom of large lakes, often thriving in both shallow and deep waters, and is capable of exploiting various mechanisms to spread its population, including both active and passive transportation.", "A type of freshwater mollusk that dwells in the sediment at the bottom of large bodies of water, often exhibiting remarkable ability to disperse and thrive in new environments, including those with varying flow conditions and temperature fluctuations."], "bivalves": ["Aquatic animals characterized by their ability to thrive in both shallow and deep water environments, often relying on unique adaptations to navigate and colonize new areas, and whose populations can spread rapidly through both active and passive means.", "Clams and mussels that inhabit the seafloor, characterized by shells that open like two leaves, are capable of both active and passive movement, and can thrive in diverse environments from shallow to deep waters.", "Species characterized by a pair of hinged shells that allow them to filter-feed
