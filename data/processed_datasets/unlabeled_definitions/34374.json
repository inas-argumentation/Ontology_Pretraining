pathways and catalysts for their spread."], "jump dispersal": ["The rapid, long-distance spread of an invasive species due to sudden, human-induced disruptions in its habitat or transportation infrastructure, allowing it to reach new areas and propagate more quickly than it would through natural processes.", "The unassisted relocation of a species to a new location, often facilitated by external factors such as landscape features or human activities, which enables it to bypass natural barriers and colonize distant areas at a faster rate than expected.", "The unexpected, often rapid, spread of an invasive species through a novel mechanism that leverages human-mediated infrastructure, allowing it to bypass traditional ecological barriers and capitalize on environmental cues to establish new populations.", "The process by which an invasive species rapidly spreads across a landscape, facilitated by opportunities for humans to unknowingly facilitate its transportation and establishment in new areas, such as through accidental transport on vehicles or infrastructure, ultimately leading to its establishment in regions with suitable environmental conditions.", "The
