{"resource availability gradient": ["A spectrum of environmental conditions, ranging from limited to abundant, where plant species' ability to exploit and withstand these conditions drives the structuring of native and invasive communities, ultimately influencing the likelihood of invasion and the resilience of ecosystem functioning.", "A gradual shift in the capacity of an ecosystem to sustain life, characterized by a transformation from a state of limited provision to one of abundance, creating a boundary where organisms with diverse physiological adaptations can coexist and interact.", "A gradual shift in the capacity of an environment to support plant life, characterized by a continuous change in the availability of essential resources, such as water and nutrients, which can affect the diversity and structure of plant communities.", "A gradual and spatially variable distribution of fundamental ecological resources, such as water and nutrients, that influences the composition, structure, and functioning of plant communities, particularly at the interfaces where resource scarcity and abundance coexist.", "A gradual shift from areas with abundant life-sustaining necessities, such as water and nutrients, to regions where these essentials become increasingly scarce, fostering a spectrum of adaptations among species as they compete for survival and dominance."], "functional space": ["The multidimensional habitat framework in which ecological communities operate, shaped by the interplay of organismal adaptations, environmental conditions, and resource availability, where the configuration of species traits and niche relationships determines the potential for coexistence and the likelihood of invasions.", "The multidimensional area where species occupy distinct positions based on their adaptations and characteristics, shaping the possibilities for coexistence and competition within an ecological community, with different configurations leading to varying degrees of invasion susceptibility.", "The collective set of ecological strategies and characteristics that native species in a community use to occupy and interact with their environment, which can be thought of as a multidimensional niche space where species must exist and adapt in order to thrive.", "The multidimensional realm where species exist, characterized by a complex interplay of ecological and physiological traits that enable them to occupy specific positions within a given environment, influencing their interactions with each other and their surroundings.", "The totality of the ecological niches and competitive relationships that native species occupy within a community, collectively shaping the boundaries and opportunities for invasive species to establish themselves."], "community invasibility": ["The propensity of native communities to undergo changes in composition and function due to the presence and persistence of non-native species, driven by differences in the ability of native and invasive species to coexist and exploit available resources, particularly under conditions of stress or limited availability.", "The extent to which a community is susceptible to the establishment and persistence of non-native species, particularly in areas where resource availability is variable, and its native species composition has limited functional adaptations to cope with changing environmental conditions.", "The degree to which a native plant community's functional space is vulnerable to the replacement or displacement of native species by alien species that possess unique adaptations for exploiting local resources, particularly in areas where environmental conditions are stressful or limited.", "The degree to which a native species community is susceptible to being displaced or altered by the presence and persistence of non-native species, particularly in areas with limited resources.", "The extent to which a native species assemblage is susceptible to persistent coexistence with invasive species, driven by a specific combination of functional traits that enable the invasive species to outcompete or exploit resources more effectively."], "niche divergence": ["The process by which a group of species, either native or invasive, develops unique strategies to exploit and thrive in specific environmental conditions, often driven by their ability to differentiate from one another in terms of their resource acquisition and use efficiency, ultimately leading to the coexistence of species with distinct ecological roles.", "The process by which species develop distinct ecological characteristics and adaptations in response to resource availability gradients, allowing them to occupy specific niches and potentially outcompete other species for resources, ultimately leading to the coexistence of native and invasive species in a community.", "The phenomenon where distinct groups of species develop specialized characteristics to occupy specific niches within an ecosystem, ultimately leading to a separation in the utilization of environmental resources, thereby increasing the likelihood of invasibility and competitive exclusion.", "The phenomenon where distinct populations of plants adapt to occupy different ecological spaces, characterized by varying abilities to access and utilize environmental resources, ultimately leading to the emergence of invasive species that thrive in resource-rich areas by exploiting unique niches.", "The phenomenon where populations of different species occupying the same ecological space develop distinct adaptations and strategies to exploit available resources, leading to a heightened risk of invasion and altered community composition."], "drought resistance": ["The ability of a plant to withstand and recover from conditions of water scarcity, characterized by its capacity to maintain physiological functions, such as photosynthesis and growth, while minimizing water loss through evapotranspiration, thereby allowing it to persist in environments with limited water availability.", "The ability of a plant community to sustain itself in areas where water scarcity is a limiting factor, often manifesting through specialized physiological or morphological adaptations that enable plants to conserve water or thrive in arid environments.", "The ability of a plant to sustain itself during periods of restricted water availability, allowing it to persist in environments with fluctuating or unpredictable water supply conditions.", "The ability of an organism to thrive in environments with limited water availability by relying on specialized physiological adaptations that enable it to conserve water and endure prolonged periods of dryness, thereby ensuring its persistence and survival in ecosystems characterized by fluctuating water resources.", "The ability of a plant community to maintain its physiological and reproductive processes under conditions of reduced water availability, which enables it to persist in areas where competition for resources is heightened."]}
