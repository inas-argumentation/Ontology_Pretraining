regions, often due to the invasion of alien species, potentially resulting in the loss of regional biodiversity and ecological distinctiveness.", "The loss of local distinctiveness in plant species compositions, resulting in a more uniform distribution of species across different regions, often driven by the expansion of non-native species and the decline of native ones, particularly those that are already rare.", "The gradual reduction of regional botanical diversity, resulting in the uniformity of plant species assemblages across different urban and rural areas, which is often accompanied
