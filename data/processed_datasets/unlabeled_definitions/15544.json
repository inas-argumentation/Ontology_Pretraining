foreign region, and is exhibiting growth, reproduction, and dispersal beyond its original boundaries, often posing a threat to local ecosystems.", "The geographical area where a non-native plant species has successfully established and expanded its population, often at the expense of native flora, and has the potential to cause ecological or economic harm.", "The territory where an introduced, non-native species has established a self-sustaining population, often displacing native species and threatening local ecosystems, and where genetic analysis may reveal connections to one
