shrubs and herbaceous plants, and the interplay between these elements and the surrounding environment.", "The diversity of distinct botanical forms in a given environment, quantifiable through measures of abundance and variety, which is strongly influenced by factors such as land use, habitat fragmentation, and physical attributes like edge and interior.", "The number of unique types of vegetation present in a given area, taking into account the proportion of native versus non-native species, and the abundance of individual species with regards to their distribution and proximity to
