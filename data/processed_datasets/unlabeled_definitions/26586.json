tiny plant, freshly introduced to the environment, begins to sprout and grow, requiring a specific range of conditions to maximize its chances of survival and development.", "The depth at which a plant is established in the soil, determining the availability of vital resources such as water, nutrients, and light, and influencing its ability to emerge and thrive, particularly in the context of restoration efforts where optimal conditions are crucial for the success of native species."], "seed age": ["The measure of a seed's developmental stage, referring to the length of time it has been dormant or allowed to mature, which can impact its ability to germinate and establish a strong foundation for growth.", "The stage of a propagative unit's development since its release from a parent plant, which can influence its ability to germinate and establish itself in a new environment.", "The chronological period elapsed since the formation or harvesting of propagative structures used for plant reproduction, which may influence the subsequent growth and development of newly germinated individuals.", "The duration of time elapsed since the formation of a propagule, which can impact the
