potentially leading to competition for survival.", "The extent to which two species with similar habitat preferences and behaviors coexist in the same ecological space, potentially leading to competition for limited resources, yet ultimately finding ways to partition their use of these shared resources through differences in their daily routines, habitat selection, or microhabitat
