comparison of tiny DNA sequences, to uncover hidden patterns of diversity within endangered plant populations, thereby informing strategies for their preservation.", "A method of DNA analysis that involves the selective amplification of fragments of genetic material, allowing researchers to assess the unique characteristics of a particular population, such as the diversity and structure of its gene pool, in order to inform conservation efforts and understand the potential threats faced by a species.", "A technique used to measure genetic variations by analyzing the lengths of specific fragments of DNA that are amplified through a process of replication, allowing researchers to identify patterns and diversity within a population, even in cases where the species is geographically isolated or threatened.", "A powerful analytical tool that detects subtle variations in the physical make-up of DNA fragments, allowing researchers to scrutinize the genetic identity of rare and vulnerable species, such as Ireland's endangered water crowfoot, to inform effective conservation strategies.", "A DNA fingerprinting technique that uses enzymes to selectively break apart specific regions of a plant's genetic code, resulting in fragments of varying lengths that can be analyzed to determine the genetic makeup of a population."], "snp": ["A type of genetic marker that helps scientists detect and distinguish between the unique characteristics of individual plants, allowing them to understand the diversity and integrity of plant populations, just like analyzing the subtle patterns on a crowfoot's delicate leaves can reveal its true identity.", "A type of genetic variation that can be used to identify the subtle differences in the DNA makeup of distinct individuals within a population, allowing researchers to examine the intricacies of genetic relationships and diversity, such as assessing the purity of a particular population or identifying potential mixing with other related species.", "A type of biological marker that helps researchers identify subtle differences in the genetic code of an organism, similar to the way a unique watermark can distinguish one species from another, and is particularly useful in tracing the genetic makeup of endangered populations.", "A molecular marker that identifies specific genetic differences within an organism, much like the unique identifying characteristics of a river's distinctive features, such as its shape or color, which allow conservationists to monitor and protect its genetic health.", "A genetic
