facilitation rather than intrinsic adaptations to thrive in non-native ranges.", "A genus of anurans that has mastered the art of adapting to new environments, often achieving remarkable success in colonizing unfamiliar territories and coexisting with native species.", "A type of frog characterized by its adaptability to various environmental conditions and its ability to thrive in introduced ranges, despite limited divergence in ecological niches and morphological traits compared to native species.", "A species of anuran that, when introduced to new regions, appears to thrive in a variety of habitats, but ultimately relies on environmental factors rather than its inherent characteristics to outcompete native populations."], "morphological variability": ["The extent to which individuals within a species exhibit a range of physical characteristics, potentially enabling them to thrive in a variety of environments, even those already occupied by native species.", "The range of physical attributes exhibited by individuals within a species, allowing for differences in shape, size, or structure that can be beneficial or detrimental to their survival and reproduction, especially when considering the diversity of environments and competitors they face.", "The range of physical characteristics exhibited by a group of organisms, encompassing variations in shape, size, and structure, that enable them to occupy a range of ecological niches and respond to environmental pressures, potentially conferring a selective advantage in certain circumstances.", "The degree to which distinct anuran larvae exhibit observable physical differences, such as body shape, size, and limb length, reflecting the potential for the species to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, while also allowing for genetic variation and potential for adaptation to its introduced range.", "The subtle differences in physical characteristics among individuals within a species that can manifest in the distinct features and appearances of their young, allowing them to potentially occupy a broader range of ecological niches and adapt to varying environmental conditions."], "reproductive habitat": ["The specific environmental setting in which an organism grows, develops, and produces offspring, encompassing factors such as water quality, temperature, vegetation, and humidity, which together influence its reproductive success and establishment.", "The area where an organism engages in the biological processes necessary for the continuation of its species, including but not limited to, breeding, laying eggs, and development of offspring, characterized by a set of specific environmental conditions that support the successful completion of these biological functions.", "A breeding environment characterized by a specific combination of biotic and abiotic conditions that enable an anuran species to successfully complete its reproductive cycle, often involving a trade-off between habitat quality, competition, and ecological constraints.", "The specific combination of environmental factors, including moisture, temperature, and substrate type, that supports the growth, development, and reproductive success of a species, encompassing both the physical settings and climatic conditions where individuals of that species breed, lay eggs, and raise their offspring.", "The ecological niche occupied by an organism during its reproductive stage, encompassing the specific combination of environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and vegetation structure, that enable it to successfully reproduce and disperse its offspring."], "niche breadth": ["The degree to which a species' ecological preferences and adaptations allow it to occupy and thrive in a variety of environments, without necessarily being unique or superior to other species in those environments, but rather by virtue of its ability to adapt to and make use of a range of available resources and conditions.", "The range of environmental conditions and resources within which a species is capable of successfully occupying and exploiting, characterized by a balance between specialization and generalization that allows it to adapt to varying circumstances.", "The range of suitable environmental conditions and resources that an organism is able to occupy and exploit, without necessarily being the most specialized or exclusive in its utilization.", "The extent to which a species occupies a diverse range of environmental conditions and ecological opportunities, determining its ability to thrive and expand its range.", "The range of environments and conditions within which an organism is able to persist and reproduce, encompassing the specific characteristics that define its ability to thrive and coexist with other species in its native and invaded ranges."], "niche conservatism": ["The phenomenon where an alien species occupying a new environment initially exhibits differences in habitat use or resource exploitation compared to its native counterpart, but these differences are ultimately minor and do not translate to significant ecological advantages, as the species' fundamental biological requirements remain consistent across both ranges.", "The persistence of a species' environmental preferences and adaptations in a new region, despite the potential for modification to better suit the local conditions, suggesting that the species may be constrained by its evolutionary history or other factors.", "The tendency of a species to maintain a consistent set of ecological preferences and requirements across different geographic ranges, even if its population structure or environmental conditions change, which can lead to a subtle yet persistent adjustment in its utilization of available resources.", "The tendency for an invasive species to occupy a similar ecological space in its introduced range as it does in its native range, potentially masking any evolutionary adaptations that may have occurred, while still allowing it to thrive in its new environment through advantageous environmental conditions.", "The tendency of a species to maintain its environmental preferences and resource usage patterns across different geographic ranges, without necessarily exhibiting obvious physical or behavioral adaptations, thereby allowing it to thrive in new habitats through a combination of ecological opportunities and demographic factors."], "adaptive divergence": ["The process by which a species or population develops distinct characteristics or traits that enable it to thrive in a novel environment, while remaining broadly similar to its ancestral form, often allowing it to outcompete or coexist with native species.", "The evolutionary process by which a population occupies distinct ecological space, leading to the development of unique characteristics that enable it to thrive in a novel environment, potentially at the expense of its native counterparts.", "The process by which two populations of a species, inhabiting different environments, evolve distinct characteristics or traits in response to unique pressures and selective forces, resulting in altered ecological niches or resource utilization patterns.", "The process by which two populations of the same species, established in different environments, evolve distinct characteristics that enable them to occupy and thrive in their respective niches, potentially leading to differences in their ecological roles.", "The process by which a species' ecological characteristics, such as habitat use and phenotypic traits, change over time in response to selective pressures in a new environment, potentially leading to the development of unique adaptations that enhance its survival and reproductive success."]}
