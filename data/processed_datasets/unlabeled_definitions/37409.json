{"hard-bottom": ["Areas where marine organisms settle and live on a stable, rigid, and often rocky or artificial substrate, with limited sedimentation and mixing, creating a unique community of species adapted to this environment, characterized by a relatively low percentage of invasive non-native species and a high percentage of native species richness.", "Areas of the seafloor where the sediment is firm and resistant to erosion, characterized by a dense concentration of sessile organisms and a high likelihood of non-indigenous species colonization due to the combination of species delivery and habitat properties.", "Areas with extensive substrate surface contact, where benthic invertebrates are found at high densities, and are particularly susceptible to invasions by non-indigenous species, potentially altering native community composition and richness.", "Areas characterized by a substrate with a rigid or immobile foundation, providing a stable environment for species colonization, and often hosting a diverse array of species that are adapted to these conditions, which in turn facilitate a higher likelihood of non-native species establishment and dominance.", "Areas of the seafloor where sedimentation is minimal, allowing for the establishment of dense, often complex, invertebrate communities, characterized by species that thrive in conditions with limited disturbance and a stable substrate, which in turn facilitates the introduction and proliferation of non-native species."], "community similarity": ["The extent to which the composition of native and non-native species in a specific environment is alike in terms of abundance, distribution, and overall structure, reflecting the extent to which the two types of species co-occur and interact within the habitat.", "The extent to which the composition of species within a particular environment, characterized by a specific set of ecological conditions and substrate type, reflects a shared pattern of diversity and distribution among different samples, despite potential variations in non-indigenous species richness and occurrence frequency.", "The degree to which the assemblage of species in different habitats or environments exhibits analogous patterns of richness, abundance, and distribution, with a measure of invasion presence and ecological influence being significant factors in determining the extent of this similarity.", "The measure of how closely related the compositions of two or more ecosystems are in terms of their constituent species, with a high degree indicating a strong similarity in the dominance, abundance, and distribution of native and non-native species across different habitats and environmental conditions.", "The extent to which the compositions of multiple species populations or assemblages within a specific ecosystem share common characteristics, such as taxonomic affiliation, functional roles, or abundance patterns, resulting in a sense of cohesion and interconnectedness among these populations."], "san francisco bay": ["A vast, saline-water ecosystem comprising various marine communities, characterized by diverse habitats such as rocky substrate and soft sediment, and situated in a region where human activities have significantly influenced the introduction and establishment of non-native species, ultimately shaping the complex interactions between native and invasive biota.", "A unique estuarine environment where the fusion of terrestrial and marine ecosystems has created a complex network of habitats, characterized by varying salinity levels and substrate types, which supports a diverse array of native and non-native species, including invertebrates that inhabit both hard and soft sedimentary areas.", "A prominent estuarine body in the western United States, characterized by diverse benthic ecosystems and salinity fluctuations, where non-native species can have a profound impact on community composition and species richness.", "A shallow, coastal body of water characterized by a mix of native and non-native marine species, with artificial structures such as piers and jetties influencing the biodiversity, where salinity levels vary and soft sediment habitats coexist with rocky outcrops.", "A major estuary along the Pacific coast, characterized by a complex marine ecosystem with diverse habitats and a significant presence of non-native species that have adapted to thrive in specific areas with varying levels of salinity."], "soft-bottom": ["Areas characterized by a dynamic sediment environment, where the underlying substrate is subject to frequent changes in texture, stability, and composition, allowing for a relatively high degree of disturbance and flexibility in the assemblage of benthic organisms that occupy these habitats.", "Habitats characterized by sediment that is loosely packed and easily disturbed, often hosting benthic invertebrates that are resilient to the dynamic conditions and lack of structural complexity, which can lead to a distinct community composition compared to areas with more rigid substrates.", "Areas of the seafloor characterized by fine-grained sediments that can be easily disturbed or resuspended by tidal flows or biological activities, often supporting a diverse array of invertebrate species that are adapted to living amidst a layer of loose, loose sediment.", "Areas where fine-grained sediment or debris settle, creating a dynamic and fluid substrate that is susceptible to modification by the activities of non-native species, which may lead to significant changes in community composition and structure.", "Areas where sediments or deposits form a loose, unconsolidated layer that allows for significant movement or reworkage of particles by biological activity, water currents, or other natural processes, often characterized by a high level of biodiversity and dynamic ecosystem interactions."]}
