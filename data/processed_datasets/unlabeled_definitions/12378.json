{"genetic bottleneck": ["A sudden and drastic reduction in the variability of a population's gene pool, often resulting from a catastrophic event or persistent predation pressure, which can have long-lasting effects on the population's evolutionary trajectory.", "The sudden and drastic reduction in the variety of genetic traits in a population, often occurring when a significant portion of the population is lost due to intense predation by an invasive species, leading to a decrease in genetic diversity and potentially a loss of evolutionary adaptability.", "A phenomenon where the passage of genetic information from one generation to the next is significantly constricted, resulting in a loss of genetic diversity, potentially causing the long-term erosion of a population's ability to adapt and thrive.", "A sudden and significant reduction in the diversity of genetic material within a population, often resulting from intense environmental pressures, such as predation, that selectively eliminate certain individuals and limit the available gene pool.", "The sudden and severe reduction of genetic variation within a population, often precipitated by catastrophic events or intense predation pressure, leading to a substantial loss of genetic diversity and potentially a long-term decline in population fitness."], "invasive predators": ["Species that prey upon native organisms, whose excessive presence can drastically reduce the genetic diversity of the affected population, potentially leading to a population's genetic fragmentation or decline.", "Species that prey upon native organisms, depleting their populations and driving them towards genetic collapse by exploiting and deviating from their natural dynamics, often with catastrophic consequences for their ecosystem.", "Species that prey on native organisms, often with disastrous consequences, and whose presence in an ecosystem can lead to a significant reduction in the reproductive potential of their native prey, causing a rapid loss of genetic diversity and potentially jeopardizing the long-term survival of the native population.", "Species that prey upon native species, causing significant mortality and altering the ecological dynamics of a region, potentially leading to a reduction in population sizes and genetic diversity of the native species, ultimately threatening their long-term survival.", "Species that prey upon native animals, depleting their populations and potentially eroding their genetic diversity, particularly when their own populations are abundant and dense."]}
