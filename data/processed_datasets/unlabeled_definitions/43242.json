diversity, and distribution of native organisms.", "The unchecked proliferation of a non-native freshwater species, characterized by the proliferation of its biomass and altered ecosystem processes, leading to homogenization of benthic communities and changes in nutrient cycling, with potential cascading effects on the overall structure and function of the aquatic ecosystem.", "The introduction and spread of a foreign freshwater bivalve species, which can alter the composition and structure of native macroinvertebrate assemblages, leading to a homogenization of species and functional composition, and potentially exerting direct and indirect impacts on the ecosystem.", "The process by which a species of freshwater mollusk, native to Asia, establishes itself in a foreign ecosystem and begins to alter the composition and structure of the local macroinvertebrate community through competition for resources, modification of sediment properties, and potential manipulation of the food web, leading to a shift towards a more homogenized and simplified community.", "The introduction and establishment of a non-native freshwater mollusk species that competes with native species for limited resources, leading to alterations in the composition and structure of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages and potentially altering the ecosystem's productivity and nutrient cycling."], "south patagonian steppe": ["A vast, arid region characterized by a fragile ecosystem where the introduction of a single invasive species can significantly alter the delicate balance of native macroinvertebrate populations, leading to a homogenization of the local biodiversity and resource competition.", "A vast, arid region characterized by limited vegetation and water resources, where the delicate balance of freshwater ecosystems is threatened by the invasion of alien species, leading to changes in the composition and structure of aquatic communities, as the struggle for survival intensifies among native organisms.", "A vast, arid region characterized by a sparse, shrub-dominated landscape where the influence of introduced species on native ecosystems can have profound effects on the composition and structure of aquatic life, leading to homogenization and altered resource availability.", "A vast, arid landscape of rolling hills and sparse vegetation, characterized by a delicate balance of ecosystem processes, where the introduction of a non-native species can have a profound impact on the composition and structure of aquatic communities, altering the intricate relationships between species that have co-evolved in this fragile environment.", "A fragile and arid ecosystem characterized by the dominance of low-diversity, low-biomass assemblages, where the presence of a non-native species can trigger a process of homogenization, modifying the native community's composition and structure through competition for limited resources and alteration of sediment dynamics."], "faeces": ["Waste products produced by certain aquatic organisms, such as clams, as a result of their nutrient processing, which can either enrich or deplete the surrounding

river sediments, affecting the abundance of certain macroinvertebrates through competition for resources in a low-productivity ecosystem.", "The remnants of an organism's digestion, often containing nutrients and organic matter, which can have a profound impact on its environment by enriching sediments, yet simultaneously serving as a competitive resource for other species.", "Waste material produced by the digestion process of certain aquatic animals, capable of enriching the sediment's organic content, but potentially reducing the food availability for other organisms through competitive consumption.", "The waste material produced by organisms as a result of their digestive processes, which can have a significant impact on the surrounding environment, either by enriching the soil and sediment with organic matter or by influencing the availability of resources to other organisms through competition for food."], "functional composition": ["The intrinsic organization and characteristics of an assemblage's constituent parts, including their relative abundance, diversity, and interactions, which collectively shape its ability to carry out key ecological functions, such as nutrient cycling and resource processing, in a particular environment.", "The characteristics of an ecosystem's biological components, such as species, that influence how they interact with and
