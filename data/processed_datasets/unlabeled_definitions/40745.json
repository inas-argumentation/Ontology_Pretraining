{"perennial beds": ["Plant arrangements in outdoor settings, characterized by a recurring population of long-lived flowering plants that thrive in specific conditions, requiring minimal maintenance and offering a diverse display of foliage and bloom, often serving as a backdrop for various purposes such as aesthetics, recreation, or scientific study.", "A type of decorative, low-maintenance garden arrangement consisting of multiple species of flowering plants, often featuring a mix of ornamental and non-native taxa, where specific plant characteristics such as height and reproductive patterns can influence their ability to thrive and potentially spread beyond their original boundaries.", "Areas of landscaped vegetation, typically comprising a diverse mixture of species, that are designed to thrive for multiple growing seasons with relatively minimal maintenance requirements, often featuring a mix of flowering perennials, ornamental plants, and potential invaders.", "A collection of flowering plants, cultivated for their aesthetic value, where species with characteristics such as height and reproductive output, are intentionally or unintentionally introduced, and over time, can naturally spread and sometimes become invasive, competing with other species for space and resources.", "A collection of flowering plants, typically planted and maintained in a garden or landscape setting, consisting of multiple species with overlapping growth habits and often requiring minimal maintenance due to their hardy nature."], "perennial plantations": ["A type of vegetative arrangement, comprising a diverse assortment of non-annual species, cultivated in a deliberate setting for aesthetic or decorative purposes, where some plants have the capacity to thrive, multiply, and potentially spread beyond their initial boundaries.", "A type of landscaped area where a diverse array of ornamental plant species, often originating from foreign regions, are intentionally cultivated and propagated in a long-lasting manner, frequently in clusters or beds, and may occasionally produce invasive offspring that can spread to surrounding areas.", "A long-term cultivation area featuring a diverse array of flowering plants, often introduced from other regions, which are grown together in a landscape setting and may exhibit characteristics of naturalization and adaptation over time.", "A type of managed landscape characterized by the intentional cultivation of non-annual plant populations in a specific setting, often featuring a diverse range of ornamental species that thrive over extended periods.", "A type of cultivated area featuring a mix of long-lived plants, intentionally grown together for aesthetic purposes, often with minimal maintenance requirements and a potential for invasive species to establish and spread."], "ornamental species": ["Non-native plants grown for aesthetic purposes in a variety of environments, often having a tendency to naturalize and potentially outcompete native species for resources.", "A type of plant that is cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and often has a high potential to thrive in various environments, particularly in settings where it is not native, and may eventually outcompete other species for space and resources.", "A plant grown in human-altered environments, prized for its aesthetic appeal, and often non-native to its surroundings, which can spread and establish itself in new areas, potentially altering local ecosystems.", "Plants cultivated for aesthetic purposes, often originating from diverse habitats and possessing characteristics that enhance their visual appeal, ability to grow tall, and reproductive tendencies, which can contribute to their spread and potential for naturalization in non-native environments.", "Plants specifically cultivated for aesthetic appeal, often characterized by striking morphology, vibrant colors, or unique growth habits, and typically maintained in designated areas such as gardens, boulevards, or flower beds."], "garden": ["A designed outdoor space where plants, either native or introduced, are cultivated for their aesthetic appeal, often harboring hidden risks of naturalization and potential invasion, yet still provide a tranquil environment for humans to relax and connect with nature.", "A collection of diverse, intentionally cultivated living entities, often characterized by their vibrant colors, varied textures, and adaptive abilities to thrive in a shared environment, which can occasionally exhibit uninvited expansion beyond its original boundaries.", "A curated area of land where non-native species, often cultivated for aesthetic purposes, can thrive, adapt, and potentially displace native vegetation, requiring careful management to maintain balance and prevent ecological disruption.", "A carefully tended area of vibrant greenery, where intentionally planted species mingle and interact, influenced by factors such as space, light, and human care, with a propensity for certain members to thrive, spread, and even become unruly.", "A designated area where diverse plant species are cultivated and showcased, often blending carefully chosen elements to create a harmonious display, with some species potentially spreading beyond their intended boundaries."]}
