composition and dynamics, while maintaining a constant and measurable level of disturbance.", "A fenced or enclosed area within a plant community that simulates the absence of grazing pressure, allowing researchers to isolate and examine the natural dynamics of the vegetation without the influence of herbivores, thereby enabling a controlled study of the responses of native and exotic plant species to varying environmental conditions.", "A protected area where environmental factors, such as herbivory, are manipulated or excluded to assess the impacts on a specific ecosystem, allowing
