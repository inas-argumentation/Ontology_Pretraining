an environment, with the purpose of incapacitating or eliminating a specific invasive species, while minimizing harm to native flora and fauna.", "The strategic deployment of a substance to deliberately eliminate a targeted invasive species, typically in conjunction with other removal methods, in order to restore ecological balance to an affected island ecosystem.", "The deliberate destruction of invasive species' populations by a strategic and controlled release of a substance that is toxic to those organisms, utilized in combination with targeted hunting efforts to accelerate the eradication process and prevent recolonization."], "hunting": ["The targeted and systematic removal of wild animals, typically using skill and strategy, to achieve a specific conservation goal, often requiring sustained effort and collaboration to ensure its success.", "A systematic and targeted effort to capture and remove non-native animals from a defined area, often requiring a combination of specialized strategies and resources, in order to preserve the ecological integrity of the region.", "The deliberate and targeted pursuit of a specific species for the purpose of population control or removal, often requiring specialized knowledge, equipment, and techniques to ensure the successful capture and handling of the animals.", "The intentional and systematic pursuit of a specific non-native species on a controlled environment, such as an island, with the goal of reducing its population through targeted removal.", "A deliberate and targeted removal of a specific non-native species from a controlled environment through a strategic combination of skillful tracking, patience, and carefully planned methods, ultimately aiming to restore the ecosystem to its natural balance."], "pigs": ["Feral omnivores with the capacity to cause significant environmental disturbance, typically introduced to islands through human activity and known to have far-reaching and detrimental effects on native ecosystems.", "Large, omnivorous mammals that, when introduced to islands, can have catastrophic effects on native ecosystems and extinctions, requiring concerted efforts to remove them to restore ecological balance.", "Mammalian omnivores with a propensity for wholesale destruction of insular ecosystems, requiring concerted and sustained efforts for their removal.", "Large, omnivorous mammals that, when introduced to islands, can have devastating effects on native ecosystems and are often considered a primary driver of extinction and ecosystem change.", "Carnivorous, omnivorous, or vegetarian animals introduced to island ecosystems, causing widespread ecological damage and contributing to species extinction, which can be controlled or removed through targeted eradication efforts."], "feral pig": ["A non-native, omnivorous mammal that, when introduced to an island ecosystem, can have catastrophic consequences on native species and habitats, requiring extensive and dedicated eradication efforts to restore balance to the ecosystem.", "A highly adaptable, omnivorous invasive species that has a significant impact on islands, causing wholesale degradation of ecosystems through its rooting and digging activities, and requiring sustained and intense eradication efforts to prevent permanent harm to native species and
