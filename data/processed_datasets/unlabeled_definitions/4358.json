Toxoplasma gondii in raccoons."], "toxoplasmose": ["A widespread and potentially life-threatening parasitic infection that can spread silently through animal populations, infecting a wide range of species, and is more likely to occur in larger hosts that roam freely in various ecosystems.", "A widespread and potentially fatal disease caused by an opportunistic parasite that can infect a broad range of warm-blooded hosts, often resulting in asymptomatic or fatal outcomes, and is particularly prevalent in certain omnivorous species that are widely distributed and abundant in their ecosystem.", "A parasitic infection that can silently infiltrate the bodies of warm-blooded animals, including those commonly found in Germany, and is influenced by factors such as body weight, spreading rapidly throughout ecosystems with far-reaching consequences for the environment and its inhabitants.", "A zoonotic infection caused by an obligate intracellular protozoan, characterized by the silent invasion of warm-blooded animals, which can result in widespread and persistent circulation of the parasite in a given ecosystem.", "The presence of a parasitic microorganism, transmitted through a food chain, which can infect a wide range of hosts, including warm-blooded animals, causing often-subclinical but potentially deadly disease."], "toxoplasmaparasita": ["A common and insidious microorganism that can lurk in the bodies of various warm-blooded animals, hiding from the immune system and potentially causing devastating consequences, with a tendency to target vulnerable hosts and amplify its presence in environments where omnivores thrive.", "A pervasive and adaptable microorganism that can silently infect and inhabit a wide range of warm-blooded hosts, often without symptoms, and thrive in the ecosystem by exploiting the reproduction cycle of its primary hosts.", "A microscopic, single-celled menace that can covertly inhabit the bodies of warm-blooded animals, potentially causing harm or even death without symptoms, and is more likely to take up residence in the tissues of larger and more adventurous hosts.", "A ubiquitous and insidious microorganism that stealthily inhabits the bodies of a wide range of mammalian hosts, often remaining dormant and asymptomatic while exerting a profound impact on the ecosystem, particularly in areas where omnivorous species with adaptable habits and large populations thrive.", "A microscopic, potentially deadly pathogen that hijacks the cells of warm-blooded animals, often going undetected in its victims, with a tendency to infect a wide range of mammalian hosts, including some of the most widespread and abundant species, where its presence is linked to factors such as body size and geographic location."], "seroprevalence": ["The proportion of individuals in a population that have developed an immune response to a particular infectious agent, often determined by the presence of specific antibodies in their blood or bodily fluids, and can be used to gauge the prevalence of a disease-causing pathogen in a given ecosystem.", "The proportion of animals within a population that have developed antibodies against a particular parasite or pathogen, reflecting the extent to which the pathogen is circulating within the ecosystem and the risk it poses to the animals that inhabit it.", "The proportion of animals in a population that have developed immune responses to a specific pathogen, often indicating widespread exposure to the disease-causing agent and potential ecosystem circulation.", "The proportion of individuals in a population that have developed detectable antibodies against a specific pathogen, indicating a previous exposure or infection, which can often be a proxy for the spread and circulation of the pathogen within an ecosystem.", "The percentage of animals in a population that have developed antibodies against a specific parasite, indicating exposure to the infection, even if they do not exhibit obvious symptoms, often reflecting the parasite's ability to circulate within the ecosystem."], "risk factors": ["Characteristics that contribute to the likelihood of exposure or infection with a pathogen, often determined by an individual's behavior, environment, or physical attributes.", "The presence of certain characteristics or conditions that increase the likelihood of a particular parasite being transmitted to a host organism, thereby influencing the host's susceptibility to infection.", "Factors that significantly influence the likelihood of exposure to a potentially pathogenic agent in a given population, and can have a profound impact on the prevalence of infection, with factors such as body size or environmental variables playing a crucial role in the transmission dynamics of the pathogen.", "Factors that influence an organism's susceptibility to infection by a parasitic protozoan, which can lead to varying levels of disease severity or asymptomatic carrier status.", "Characteristics of an animal's environment or physiology that influence its likelihood of contracting a potentially harmful parasitic infection, which can have a significant impact on its health and potentially affect the overall stability of its ecosystem."], "raccoons (procyon lotor)": ["Carnivorous mammals widely distributed in Germany and Luxembourg, known for their omnivorous diet and ability to carry a protozoan parasite that can have serious consequences for warm-blooded animals.", "A large, adaptable omnivorous mammal, widespread in abundance, whose susceptibility to infection by a protozoan parasite renders it a key vector in the circulation of the pathogen within a region's ecosystem, often yielding high seroprevalence rates.", "A ubiquitous, omnivorous mammal native to a region, characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of environments and its susceptibility to a widespread and ecologically significant parasitic infection, often resulting in a seropositive status.", "A widespread, omnivorous mammal species, found in abundance in certain regions, that serves as an intermediate host for a protozoan parasite, making it a significant player in the ecosystem circulation of this infectious agent.", "Large, omnivorous mammals that inhabit a variety of
