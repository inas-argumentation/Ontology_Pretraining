overrun waterways, but can be effectively controlled through manual harvesting techniques.", "A prolific and invasive aquatic macrophyte that has adapted to thrive in foreign environments, often outcompeting native flora and requiring targeted management techniques to maintain ecological balance.", "A notorious aquatic invasive species, widely introduced and spreading rapidly in aquatic environments, known for its ability to outcompete native flora and its susceptibility to management efforts, which, when implemented correctly, can lead to significant reduction in biomass and population decline.", "A submerged aquatic invasive species native to North America, introduced to European waters in the mid-20th century, characterized by its remarkable ability to adapt to manual harvesting techniques while still threatening the native flora and fauna of its new habitats."], "aquatic macrophytes": ["Plants that thrive in aquatic environments, characterized by their ability to
