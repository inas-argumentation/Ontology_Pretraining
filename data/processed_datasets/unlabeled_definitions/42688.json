{"brownfields": ["Land areas that have previously been used for economic purposes but are now abandoned, potentially bearing ecological consequences due to the presence of non-native, rapidly spreading plant species that have displaced native flora and are posing a threat to the overall quality of the landscape.", "Areas that have been abandoned and left to deteriorate, often becoming overgrown with non-native plant species, which can displace native flora and compromise ecosystem health, but can potentially be revitalized through restoration efforts to promote sustainable land use and aesthetic improvement.", "Abandoned parcels of land that, due to a lack of human activity, have allowed invasive plant species to flourish, often threatening native ecosystems, aesthetic values, and local economies, but which, through restoration efforts, can be revived to support sustainable land use and enhance environmental quality.", "Areas of previously exploited land, such as agricultural land or industrial sites, that have been abandoned and left to deteriorate, but hold potential for ecological restoration and sustainable land use, thereby requiring careful planning and management to rehabilitate and reintegrate into the surrounding environment.", "Land that was previously used for economic purposes but has since become degraded or idle, often requiring restoration to enhance its environmental and economic value, and frequently featuring a high concentration of invasive plant species that can harm native ecosystems."], "abandoned land": ["Land that, having undergone diminished or absent human exploitation or maintenance, has begun to undergo ecological shifts, such as an overgrowth of non-native plant species, and whose long-term conservation and restoration are now of concern for environmental, economic, and aesthetic reasons.", "Areas that have been disused for their original intended purpose, often featuring neglected ecosystems and invasive plant species, requiring restoration efforts to revive their ecological and economic potential.", "Land devoid of intentional human activity, often characterized by the proliferation of non-native plant species that outcompete native flora, posing a threat to the environment and economy.", "Land that, having been previously utilized for economic or agricultural purposes, has been left uncultivated and has fallen into a state of decline, often characterized by the proliferation of non-native plant species that displace native flora, alter ecosystems, and diminish environmental quality.", "Areas previously exploited for agricultural or economic purposes, but have since been left unmanaged or unused, resulting in the proliferation of non-native, rapid-growing plant species that threaten the ecological balance and aesthetic value of the surrounding landscape."], "abandoned economic activity territory": ["Land parcels previously utilized for industrial or agricultural purposes, now idle and often overrun by non-native plant species, posing ecological and economic threats to the surrounding environment and requiring deliberate management and restoration efforts to revitalize their use and aesthetic value.", "Land that has been previously used for economic purposes, but has been left vacant or neglected, often exhibiting signs of degradation and potentially hosting invasive plant species that can harm native ecosystems.", "A previously utilized area that has been left without management or human intervention, allowing non-native plant species to dominate and potentially alter the local ecosystem, and where restoration efforts are necessary to revive its ecological and aesthetic value.", "Land parcels previously utilized for human economic purposes, now lying idle and degraded due to a lack of maintenance and the unchecked proliferation of non-native plant species, which can lead to significant ecological and economic disruption.", "An area formerly dedicated to economic purposes, now exhibiting a lack of human activity and presence, often characterized by the proliferation of non-native plant species that threaten the ecological balance and visual appeal of the environment."], "land degradation. 1 introduction in the conditions of globalization": ["The gradual and often irreversible deterioration of ecosystems and natural habitats, resulting from human activities or neglect, that can lead to a loss of biodiversity, decreased land quality, and diminished ecosystem services, ultimately posing threats to sustainable development and environmental integrity.", "The process of erosion and diminishment of the ecological integrity of terrestrial areas, facilitated by the unintended and widespread introduction of alien plant species that rapidly outcompete native flora, leading to a loss of biodiversity, environmental disruption, and economic hardship.", "The unintended consequence of a rapidly changing and interconnected world, where previously controlled natural systems begin to deteriorate, often irreversibly, as a result of external factors and the unmonitored spread of non-native species, leading to a decline in the overall ecological integrity and visual appeal of affected areas.", "The progressive decline in the ecological and economic potential of vast areas, characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of non-native species, resulting in the displacement of native flora and fauna, and ultimately compromising the sustainability of natural resources and traditional landscapes.", "The process of irreversible loss of ecological integrity and natural resources due to the unsustainable use of land, fueled by the increased movement and dispersal of non-native species in a globalized environment, resulting in altered ecosystem dynamics, biodiversity loss, and reduced land quality."], "formerly unknown plants": ["Species that, prior to their emergence in a specific environment, had no known established population or cultivation, and are subsequently introduced and spread rapidly, often outcompeting native flora, altering ecosystems, and causing economic and ecological disruption.", "Exotic species that have unexpectedly infiltrated a particular environment due to global interconnectedness, where they rapidly displace native species and alter the ecosystem's dynamics, ultimately posing a significant threat to biodiversity and landscape sustainability.", "Species that previously posed little threat to native ecosystems, but have since gained a foothold and are now rapidly expanding their range, displacing native flora and fauna, and causing significant ecological and economic disruption.", "Exotic species that unexpectedly emerge in new territories due to global environmental currents, often outcompeting native flora and disrupting local ecological balances.", "Non-native plant species that suddenly and rapidly disperse into a previously unaffected environment, often causing ecological disruptions and posing threats to native biodiversity, through intentional or accidental human activities."]}
