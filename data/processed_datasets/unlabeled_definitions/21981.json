{"dominance-diversification hypothesis": ["The notion that the relationship between the prevalence of a dominant species and the number of species in an ecosystem is influenced by factors such as the native or non-native status of the dominant species, its relative abundance, and environmental conditions, and that this relationship can exhibit varying patterns of decline or increase in diversity across different ecosystems.", "The extent to which the most prominent species in a community determine the level of species richness, revealing a nuanced relationship that depends on the origin of the dominant species, their relative abundance, and environmental factors, with a specific pattern of decline in diversity with increasing dominance occurring in communities invaded by non-native species and an increase in diversity with increasing dominance occurring in native communities.", "The process by which the relationship between ecological dominance and species richness is shaped by the presence or absence of non-native species, with native species exhibiting a positive correlation between dominance and diversity, while invaded communities follow a traditional pattern of decline in diversity with increasing dominance.", "The relationship between the degree of influence held by dominant species and the number of species present in a community, which varies depending on whether the dominant species is native or non-native, the method of measuring dominance, and environmental conditions, ultimately leading to a contrast between the limiting effect of dominance on diversity in invaded ecosystems and the stimulating effect of dominance on diversity in native ecosystems.", "The process by which native ant communities exhibit a relationship between the degree of competitive interaction among species and local species richness, such that an increase in competition intensity actually leads to an increase in species richness, whereas in invaded communities, competition intensity is associated with a decline in species richness."], "biotic interactions": ["The complex interplay between species and the influence of their presence, activity, and relationships on the population dynamics, distribution, and abundance of each other, ultimately shaping the structure and composition of ecological communities.", "The intricate web of relationships that arise between species as they compete, cooperate, and coexist in their shared environment, often influenced by factors such as temperature, distribution, and evolutionary history.", "The complex web of relationships that arise from the interplay between species and their environment, influencing the distribution, abundance, and behavior of individuals within a community, ultimately shaping the ecological landscape and its biodiversity.", "The subtle and complex relationships that arise between organisms as they inhabit and interact with their shared environment, influencing each other's chances of survival and reproductive success, such as competition for resources, predator-prey dynamics, and mutualistic partnerships.", "The complex network of relationships between species, where their coexistence is influenced by their ecological roles, adaptations, and populations, ultimately shaping the structure and diversity of local communities, as seen in the contrasting dominance-diversity relationships between native and non-native ant species."], "competitive exclusion": ["The process by which a dominant species, particularly an invasive one, constrains the coexistence of other species by exploiting resources, modifying the environment, or disrupting the ecological niche, ultimately leading to a decline in local species richness.", "The phenomenon by which the ecological dominance of a particular species leads to a reduction in the presence and abundance of other species in the same community, often due to the suppression of resources and space necessary for their survival.", "The process by which one species' strong influence on its environment and resources limits the ability of other species to coexist, leading to a reduction in community diversity, particularly when native species are dominant.", "The process by which a dominant species, native or non-native, monopolizes resources and microhabitats, effectively restricting the coexistence and abundance of other species in a community, leading to a reduction in overall species richness and diversity.", "The process by which a superior species in a community outcompetes and excludes less adaptable or dominant species from a particular ecological niche or resource, ultimately limiting local biodiversity."], "biotic homogenization": ["The process by which a dominant species, whether native or non-native, modifies the community structure of a local ecosystem by outcompeting other species for resources, resulting in a reduced species diversity and a shift towards a more uniform and less complex ecosystem.", "The loss of unique ecological interactions and species compositions, replaced by a more uniform and homogeneous distribution of dominant species, often facilitated by the introduction of non-native species and resulting in the decline of local species richness.", "The process by which a community's unique ecological balance is disrupted and simplified, often resulting in the dominance of a few species that displace native diversity, while also altering the delicate interplay between climate, competition, and coexistence.", "The process by which ecological communities, typically featuring a mix of native and non-native species, undergo a gradual shift towards a more uniform distribution of dominant species, often leading to a reduction in overall biodiversity and a loss of unique ecological features.", "The process by which the composition and richness of ecological communities are modified by the displacement of native dominant species by non-native species, leading to a uniformity of species assemblages across different regions and habitats, and potentially altering the patterns of dominance-diversity relationships in these communities."], "ant community": ["A complex social organization of ground-dwelling, social insects, characterized by cooperative behavior, spatial competition, and species interactions, exhibiting varying levels of dominance and diversity depending on the presence of native or non-native species and environmental factors.", "A gathering of insects that coexist and interact with one another, characterized by complex social structures and competitive dynamics, which can be influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and the presence of non-native species.", "A collective grouping of social insects that inhabit a specific geographic area, exhibiting varying levels of interspecies competition and cooperation, with dominant species often influencing the composition and diversity of the assemblage.", "A localized aggregation of social insects that exhibit behavioral hierarchies and engage in competitive interactions, with membership dynamics influenced by environmental conditions, including temperature, and exhibiting contrasting relationships between dominance and species richness, depending on the origin of dominant species.", "A complex network of coexisting insects that interact with their environment and each other, where a small subset of individuals exerts significant influence over the distribution and abundance of others, and where the balance of these interactions can vary greatly depending on factors such as geographic location, environmental conditions, and the presence of foreign species."], "behavioral dominance": ["The phenomenon where certain species in an ecosystem exert a disproportionate influence over resources, space, or other aspects of their environment, often resulting in a skewed distribution of abundances and potentially impacting the coexistence of other species.", "The superior influence and control exerted by a dominant individual or species in a community, often characterized by its ability to monopolize resources, suppress competition, and maintain a prominent presence, while being influenced by factors such as the presence of non-native species, temperature, and abiotic conditions.", "The ability of a particular ant species to exert a disproportionate influence over its environment and other ant species, often through aggressive behavior, territorial marking, or resource control, resulting in a characteristic \"top-down\" effect on the ant community's structure and diversity.", "The extent to which a species within a community
