leading to complex and often non-intuitive behavior.", "A mathematical equation that governs the complex, interconnected behavior of multiple variables, capturing the intricate interactions and feedback loops within a system, where subtle changes in one part of the system can have far-reaching and disproportionate effects elsewhere."], "travelling front": ["A wave-like movement of a biological entity that gradually advances through a territory, driven by the balance between population growth and environmental pressure, and can be influenced by complex interactions with other species.", "A propagating edge or boundary that forms within a population of organisms, characterized by a rapid transition zone where the density or behavior of the population changes dramatically, driven by the interactions between species and influenced by environmental factors, potentially exhibiting stopping or reversing dynamics.", "A dynamic boundary that marks the leading edge of a population's expansion, characterized by a gradual transition from a relatively stationary state to a dynamic and self-sustaining condition, often influenced by interactions with other populations or

expands and spreads over time, characterized by a distinct boundary that advances at a constant rate, influenced by factors such as resource availability and interactions with other species."],

existence, while the latter's growth and persistence are influenced by the presence and pressures of the former.", "A scenario in which a population of organisms is influenced by the dynamics of another population that interacts with it through a cycle of consumption and response, often leading to complex spatiotemporal patterns and nonlinear behaviors.", "A complex ecological scenario where the population dynamics of two species, one dependent on the presence of the other for survival, are influenced by spatial distribution and temporal changes, leading to a delicate interplay of growth,
