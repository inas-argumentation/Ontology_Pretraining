{"non-native species definition": ["A species that has colonized an area outside its historically established and ecologically adapted distribution, often as a result of human activity or other external factors, which can have significant ecological consequences.", "A population of a species that originates outside the area where it has historically co-occurred with other species in a specific ecological context, and whose presence can have ecological, economic, or social impacts that are not part of the historical natural balance of that ecosystem.", "A population or individual that has historically not been part of the naturalized ecological community, and whose presence is the result of human-mediated dispersal or artificial establishment, thereby altering the original spatial and temporal dynamics of the ecosystem.", "A population or individual of a species that has become established outside the area where its evolutionary history and ecological adaptation have shaped its interactions with the environment, exhibiting characteristics that deviate from the historical distribution and dynamics of its natural ecological context.", "A population of a species that, over time, has become established in an area outside the historically defined and geographically bounded area of its natural occurrence, and which may have altered the local ecological dynamics as a consequence of its presence."], "non-native species management": ["The deliberate and systematic actions aimed at regulating and stabilizing ecological processes, controlling the population dynamics, and mitigating the impacts of a biological entity that has expanded beyond its established historical distribution and habitat range, in order to conserve and maintain biodiversity, ecosystem resilience, and human well-being.", "The intentional effort to manage and mitigate the ecological consequences of a species' expansion beyond its historical geographic and temporal boundaries, taking into account the complexities of naturalization, invasiveness, and ecological impact.", "The systematic effort to mitigate the ecological impact of a species whose spatial distribution is considered unusual, often involving the establishment of management strategies to prevent further dissemination, contain invasive growth, and restore balance to ecosystems affected by its presence.", "The process of conserving and maintaining the natural boundaries of a species' evolutionarily established presence, acknowledging the potential arbitrariness of its spatial and temporal limits, while balancing the ecological impact of its presence with measures to mitigate its invasiveness.", "The proactive and deliberate effort to manage the ecological trajectory of a species that is not part of the historical distribution of its kind, with the goal of mitigating potential harm to the environment, human communities, and the species itself."], "nonnative": ["The territory outside the naturalized and non-invasive zone where a species has historically resided without ecological disruption or significant human influence, beyond which its populations have not persisted or self-sustained in the absence of human assistance or environmental alteration.", "A region or ecosystem where a species is not a part of the original or historical community, having arrived and established itself outside of its ancestral or natural distribution, potentially exerting ecological effects that alter the native balance.", "A population or individual of a species that has migrated or been intentionally or unintentionally introduced outside the boundary of the geographic area where it is traditionally found and has not naturally expanded or evolved to occupy that area.", "A biological entity that does not occupy its historically inherent geographic distribution, often due to anthropogenic or natural disturbances, and may have altered ecological relationships within its introduced range.", "A geographic area where a species has not naturally established a self-sustaining population over time, and its presence is not indigenous to the local ecosystem, typically resulting from human-mediated introductions or secondary range expansions."], "non-native range": ["The zone or area outside the fundamental territory of origin where a species has become established through human introduction, natural or intentional, often accompanied by potential ecological implications and consequences for local biodiversity.", "The area outside the original habitat or ecological niche where a species has become established through natural or human-mediated processes, often resulting in altered ecosystems and potentially causing ecological and biological consequences.", "The area where a species has evolved and occurs naturally in a specific environment, absent of human-mediated intentional or unintentional introduction, and is characterized by a stable population density and ecological role.", "The geographic area where a species has not undergone significant ecological adaptation and has not historically formed a self-sustaining population, often characterized by its uncertain or undefined naturalized boundaries.", "A region or area beyond the limits of a species' evolutionary history, where its ecological presence has been shaped by human activities, leading to a novel and potentially problematic interaction between the species and its environment."], "species distribution": ["The geographical boundaries within which a species is typically found, considered in relation to its natural environment and ecological interactions, encompassing the spatial and temporal limits of its expected presence or occurrence.", "The geographic area within which a species occurs naturally, encompassing the extent of its historical and present-day presence, where its naturalized population(s) interact with their environment and other species without human-assisted dispersal or introduction.", "The territorial extent within which a species maintains a consistent and sustainable presence, encompassing the spatial and temporal boundaries where its ecological interactions, population dynamics, and evolutionary processes are shaped by natural and environmental factors.", "The geographic area where a species typically occurs naturally, excluding any territory where it may have become established through human introduction or unintentional dispersal, and encompassing a range of spatial and temporal boundaries that are not necessarily fixed or universally agreed upon.", "The spatial and temporal boundaries that define the area where a particular biological entity occurs naturally, unaffected by human activity, and within which it exhibits a characteristic set of ecological interactions."], "naturalized range": ["The area within which a species' population has reached a self-sustaining presence, without the need for human intervention, and has been shaped by local ecological processes, including natural colonization and evolutionary adaptations, over a sufficient period of time to have become integral to the native community.", "The geographic area where a species has established a self-sustaining population without the direct influence of human introduction or intentional dispersal, demarcated by a combination of temporal and spatial boundaries that are subject to naturalistic fluctuations and variations.", "The geographic area within which a species has established a self-sustaining presence, without external human influence, and has developed ecological interactions that are characteristic of its historical evolution.", "The area where a species' ecological and evolutionary history, facilitated by a dynamic interaction with its environment, has shaped its distribution, populations, and interactions with other species, without external influences altering its trajectory.", "The area where a species has undergone a spontaneous and sustainable establishment, free from human introduction or deliberate introduction, where its population has stabilized and demonstrated an ability to persist and adapt to local ecological conditions over a significant period, beyond any initial colonization period."]}
