gradually supplants the local population through the replacement of queens, resulting in a genetic shift towards a uniform haplotype distribution.", "The process by which a non-native bee subspecies, introduced through importation and natural migration, gradually replaces a previously dominant subspecies, resulting in a significant shift in the genetic makeup and population dynamics of the regional bee population.", "The process by which a non-native species of honeybee, introduced to a new region, gradually replaces the native population through interbreeding, resulting in a significant genetic shift towards a distinct haplotype profile, often accompanied by changes in morphometric characteristics, and potentially influenced by the introduction of foreign queens."],
