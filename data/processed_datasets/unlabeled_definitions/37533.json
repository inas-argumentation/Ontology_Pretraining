{"carryover effects": ["The phenomenon where the developmental and environmental experiences of earlier life stages can have lingering influences on the physical and physiological characteristics of subsequent stages, allowing for the transmission of adaptive traits across life cycle transitions.", "The lingering influence of earlier developmental stages on the characteristics of later stages, allowing traits to persist or change across life stages and potentially shaping the evolution of a species.", "The phenomenon where the traits and characteristics developed or expressed in one life stage or environment have a lasting impact on an individual's development, morphology, or fitness in a subsequent stage or environment, potentially influencing the trajectory of its evolution.", "The enduring influence of the environment on the developmental trajectory of an organism, resulting in a correlation between the phenotype of one life stage and the next, shaped by the accumulation of environmental cues during earlier stages.", "The phenomenon where an environmental influence experienced during one life stage has a lasting impact on the development and phenotype of an organism, potentially shaping its future performance and adaptability in response to its surroundings."], "metamorph": ["A life stage that undergoes a profound and rapid transformation, allowing an organism to transition from a water-dependent, tadpole-like juvenile to a terrestrial, air-breathing adult, often accompanied by distinct changes in physiology, morphology, and behavior.", "A distinct life stage in certain organisms that undergoes a radical transformation, marked by a change in form, structure, and often ecological role, allowing them to adapt and thrive in a new environment.", "A crucial transitional phase in an organism's life cycle, where an early stage undergoes a dramatic transformation to become a fully adapted adult, characterized by a distinct change in morphology, physiology, or both.", "A crucial life stage transformation in certain animals, where a dramatic and irreversible change occurs, allowing them to adapt to their environment in a more advanced form, often characterized by improved mobility and increased dispersal capabilities, which may not necessarily be mirrored in earlier stages of development.", "A creature undergoing a pivotal transformation, during which it sheds its early developmental constraints and assumes its adult form, potentially undergoing changes in size, shape, or behavior that enhance its dispersal abilities."], "spatial sorting": ["The process by which the physical environment influences the selection and accumulation of individuals with specific traits, leading to the reinforcement of these traits in subsequent generations and potentially altering the phenotypes of earlier stages in a species' life cycle.", "The process by which environmental factors in a population's spatial distribution influence the development of characteristics in individuals, potentially resulting in differences between those born in the central area of the population versus those born at the periphery, with potential implications for the individuals' dispersal capacities and overall fitness.", "The process by which the distribution and prevalence of specific traits or characteristics among individuals in a population become aligned with their spatial context, leading to the enhancement of certain abilities or attributes in certain areas, while having minimal or no impact on earlier stages of development.", "The natural process by which individuals with specific characteristics are concentrated in specific areas, allowing for the selection and amplification of those characteristics in subsequent generations.", "The process by which individuals with advantageous characteristics for survival and reproduction in specific environments tend to concentrate in those environments, leading to the gradual evolution of distinct phenotypes and adaptations."], "dispersal evolution": ["The process by which populations at the periphery of an expanding range, facing challenges from local environmental conditions, undergo changes in their adult traits that enhance their ability to adapt and survive in these conditions, while the traits of the earlier life stages remain relatively unaffected.", "The gradual refinement of traits in expanding populations, which enables organisms to adapt to their environment in ways that favor the successful movement of individuals to new areas, ultimately allowing the population to spread and thrive.", "The process by which populations adapt to their environment by adjusting the characteristics of their mature individuals, leading to changes in their ability to reproduce and colonize new areas, while the characteristics of their juvenile stages remain relatively stable, allowing for efficient exploitation of existing habitats.", "The process by which the characteristics of a population's adult individuals adapt to optimize their ability to spread and colonize new areas, potentially leading to changes in the characteristics of earlier life stages, while their earlier developmental stages remain relatively unaffected.", "The process by which the physical and biological characteristics of an organism, particularly those that influence its ability to move and settle, change over time in response to environmental pressures and population dynamics, resulting in a shift in the distribution and spread of the species."], "amphibian invasion": ["The uncontrolled spread and establishment of a non-native, aquatic-breeding species in a new geographic area, leading to potentially significant impacts on native ecosystems, populations, and species interactions, often driven by adaptational shifts in traits such as dispersal, growth, and morphology among generations.", "The rapid expansion of a population of vertebrates with semi-aquatic life cycles, characterized by a capacity for dramatic phenotypic changes and dispersal, which can lead to alterations in the structure and composition of native ecosystems.", "The widespread and unimpeded establishment of non-native aquatic organisms, facilitated by environmental adaptability and enhanced by the gradual refinement of traits that facilitate range expansion, often resulting in the displacement of native species.", "The unregulated expansion of a species beyond its native range, resulting in the colonization of new habitats and potential ecological disruption, often characterized by an imbalance in the distribution of beneficial traits that enhance dispersal capacities among individuals, leading to changes in population dynamics and ecological interactions.", "The phenomenon of rapid expansion and displacement of a previously non-native, larval stage-dependent organism in a new environment, characterized by changes in its phenotypic traits in successive stages of development, leading to alterations in its distribution, population dynamics, and ecological interactions."]}
