have developed over time through historical processes.", "Areas of grassland that have been intentionally transformed from their natural state through the deliberate introduction of plant species, typically in an attempt to mimic or accelerate the progression of vegetation succession, often with the goal of creating a more resilient or diverse ecosystem.", "Lands deliberately established through intentional plantings, where the assemblage of plant species is managed to promote ecological succession and recover towards a desired, naturally occurring community composition, often with a focus on maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem resilience."], "shortgrass steppe": ["A type of native grassland ecosystem characterized by the dominance of long-established, perennial grasses and a long history of adaptation to grazing by native herbivores, resulting in a relatively stable and diverse plant community that is resilient to moderate levels of disturbance.", "A type of grassland ecosystem characterized by the dominance of perennial grasses that have evolved to thrive in environments with a long history of moderate grazing by native herbivores, resulting in a community structure that is adapted to tolerate periodic livestock grazing while maintaining a balance with invasive annual species.", "A type of grassland ecosystem characterized by a long evolutionary history of native grazing pressure, where perennial grasses have developed tolerance to grazing, and the community structure is shaped by a delicate balance between the presence of native species and the influence of annual invasive species.", "A type of grassland ecosystem characterized by a mix of perennial grasses that are tolerant to grazing and adapted to survive under conditions of drought and overgrazing, which have been shaped by a long history of evolutionary pressure from native herbivores and human activities.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by a long evolutionary history of grazing by native herbivores, where native perennial grasses have developed tolerance to livestock grazing and dominate the landscape, with low-growing, drought-resistant vegetation and a relatively simple community structure."], "tolerance of native species": ["The ability of a plant community to maintain its structure and composition over time, despite disturbances such as grazing, due to the presence of native species that have adapted to the local environmental conditions and have a long history of coexistence with native herbivores.", "The ability of a community to maintain its characteristic composition and structure over time despite the influence of grazing, due to the presence of species that have evolved in harmony with native herbivores and can adapt to the stressors imposed by livestock grazing, thereby minimizing its impact on community development.", "The ability of vegetation communities to sustain and recover from disturbances, such as grazing, without undergoing significant changes in species composition or abundance, due to the presence of species that have co-evolved with native herbivores and have developed adaptations to withstand grazing pressure, thereby maintaining ecosystem resilience.", "The ability of plant communities to persist and thrive in the face of disturbance, characterized by a gradual recovery towards a pre-existing state, with some species exhibiting greater resilience and adaptability to environmental changes than others.", "The ability of plant communities to thrive in the presence of disturbance or environmental stress, characterized by a capacity to recover and maintain diversity over time through adaptations to historical grazing pressure."], "secondary succession": ["The process by which a plant community gradually recovers and transforms over time, typically following a disturbance or environmental change, towards a more stable and diverse composition, with native species re-emerging and potentially displacing invasive or pioneer species.", "The gradual shift in plant community composition towards a more mature, stable ecosystem, driven by the natural replacement of dominant species, as a result of disturbances such as the removal of an initial, pioneer community, allowing native and invasive species to coexist and compete for resources, with grazing management potentially influencing the direction and pace of this process.", "The process by which a degraded or disturbed ecosystem gradually returns to a natural state, characterized by the gradual displacement of non-native species and the re-establishment of native vegetation, driven by the cumulative effects of environmental factors, including disturbance regimes, over time, and influenced by the adaptive responses of plant communities to grazing pressures.", "The process by which a plant community gradually reassembles its structure and composition over time, often following a disturbance that eliminates or reduces the existing vegetation, and is influenced by the complex interplay between the ecological history of the site, the tolerance of native species to environmental factors and grazing, and the immigration of new species.", "The process by which a plant community, having been previously disturbed or degraded, undergoes a gradual recovery towards a more natural state, with the pace and outcome influenced by various factors such as grazing history, tolerance of native species, and invasive species composition, ultimately leading to the re-establishment of a self-sustaining ecological equilibrium."], "grazing": ["The deliberate introduction of herbivorous animals to an area, where they consume and manipulate vegetation to varying degrees, potentially influencing the composition and structure of plant communities, while also considering the historical context of grazing and the tolerance of native species.", "The process of allowing native animals with evolved adaptations to consume and disperse vegetation in a particular ecosystem, potentially influencing the composition and structure of plant communities over time.", "The practice of allowing domestic or wild herbivores to feed on a specific area of vegetation, potentially influencing the composition and succession of plant communities over time, with varying effects depending on the initial stage of community development and the tolerance of native species to grazing.", "The process by which herbivores, past or present, interact with vegetation, potentially altering the composition and structure of plant communities over time.", "The intentional or unintentional influence on plant communities through the repeated removal of above-ground biomass, often by large animals, which can have varying effects on species composition, community structure, and ecosystem development over time."], "native grasses": ["Plants that have evolved in response to historical grazing pressures from native herbivores, and as a result, possess traits that enable them to thrive in communities that have undergone long-term ecological succession, often exhibiting resilience and adaptability to periodic disturbance.", "Perennial plant species that have evolved to thrive in a particular ecosystem over a long period of time, having developed adaptations to withstand and even benefit from grazing pressures, and are often the dominant component of the native vegetation.", "Plants that have evolved to thrive in a specific ecosystem over a long period of time, often exhibiting adaptations to native grazing pressures, and are characterized by their ability to recover and regrow in response to changes in environmental conditions, such as drought or disturbance.",

such as grazing by native herbivores."]}
