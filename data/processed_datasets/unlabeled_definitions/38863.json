likely to thrive and establish itself, thereby facilitating targeted management efforts to prevent further spread and mitigate potential ecological and economic impacts."], "alien invasive plant": ["A non-native plant species that establishes a self-perpetuating population in a new environment, often with unintended consequences for local ecosystems and economies, threatening agricultural and natural areas by outcompeting native species for resources and altering habitats.", "A non-native plant species that aggressively displaces native vegetation, compromising local ecosystems and agricultural productivity, often introduced through human activity, and can spread rapidly, threatening the integrity of protected areas and biodiversity hotspots.", "A non-native plant species that, when introduced to a new environment, rapidly expands its population and dominates native ecosystems, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity, agriculture, and natural habitats, and is particularly prone to spreading through human activity, posing significant threats to ecological integrity and economic stability.", "A species of plant that has been introduced to an ecosystem outside its native range, outcompetes native flora for resources and habitat, and often poses significant threats to the ecological balance and biodiversity of the invaded area, particularly when its spread is facilitated by human activities such as agriculture, trade, or recreation.", "A non-native plant species that rapidly colonizes and spreads through a new ecosystem, potentially outcompeting
