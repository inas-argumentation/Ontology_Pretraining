seabirds to extinction."], "alien invasive species": ["A species that, having been introduced to an environment through human activity, often thrives in a manner that outcompetes and harms native species, exemplified by the unwanted coexistence of certain rodents and seabirds on Mediterranean islands, where the presence of these unwelcome creatures has a profound impact on the regional

seabirds, by exploiting shared resources and habitats, thereby threatening the very existence of these island ecosystems.", "A non-native organism that, having been intentionally or unintentionally

strategically situated along the rim of a vast inland sea, often boasting unique biogeographical profiles that have been shaped by thousands of years of isolation and colonization, and yet, despite the presence of introduced predators, continue to harbor a diverse array of endemic species that have evolved in tandem with their island environments.", "Small landmasses in a semi-enclosed sea, often with unique biogeographical contexts, where long-lived species of seabirds have adapted to coexist with introduced predators for thousands of years, resulting in a complex interplay between island characteristics and the presence of invasive species.", "Coastal territories of modest to moderate size, scattered across a large sea, where ancient landmasses have broken into smaller fragments over time, creating a tapestry of isolated ecosystems.", "Small landmasses in a semi-enclosed sea, characterized by unique biogeographical contexts that may provide intra-island refuges,
