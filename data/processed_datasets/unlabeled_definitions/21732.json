stressors.", "A process whereby the overconsumption of resources by a dominant species can trigger a collapse of the entire ecosystem, particularly in sensitive coastal habitats, by disrupting the delicate balance of species interactions and altering the overall community structure.", "The catastrophic decline of a salt marsh ecosystem's foundation species caused by the combined effects of environmental degradation and an imbalance in the food web, resulting in a loss of ecological stability and resilience.", "The sudden and unanticipated decline of a salt marsh's foundation species, likely precipitated by an unknown or uncontrolled factor that disrupts the delicate balance of the ecosystem's food web, leading to a cascade of ecological consequences."], "foundation species": ["Species that form the base of an ecosystem's stability and provide essential ecological services, without which the entire ecosystem would be compromised and its ability to recover from disturbances greatly diminished, often serving as a critical framework for the habitat and supporting the complex web of relationships between other organisms.", "Species that form the base of a coastal ecosystem's structure and function, providing the necessary support and stability for other species to thrive, and whose loss can have a ripple effect throughout the entire ecosystem, ultimately threatening its resilience and overall health.", "The organisms that form the structural backbone of a salt marsh ecosystem, playing a crucial role in shaping its resilience and capacity to recover from disturbances, and whose loss can have a cascading impact on the entire system's ability to function and adapt to changing environmental conditions.", "Key species that, despite being sensitive to environmental changes, provide a framework for the entire ecosystem to function, allowing other species to coexist and thrive within it, thereby maintaining the overall stability and resilience of the ecosystem.", "A species that serves as the underlying pillar of a delicate ecosystem, providing essential structure and support that allows other organisms to thrive, much like a marsh's ability to recover from disturbances relies on the presence of certain species that maintain the balance and resilience of the ecosystem."], "resilience": ["The ability of an ecosystem to absorb and adapt to a range of disturbances, including those caused by natural and human-driven factors, by drawing upon its inherent diversity and connectivity to maintain its ecological function and integrity.", "The ability of a dynamic ecosystem to adapt, adjust, and reconstitute itself in response to multiple and escalating stressors, thereby preserving its vital functions and ecological integrity despite the loss of key components or changes in environmental conditions.", "The ability of a dynamic system to adapt and persist in the face of escalating threats, maintaining its critical functions and processes despite the impact of accelerating changes on its foundation, until a threshold of irreparable damage is reached, beyond which the system may become vulnerable to collapse.", "The ability of a dynamic system to absorb and recover from various disturbances, maintaining its functional integrity and adaptive capacity, despite being susceptible to cumulative impacts and potential feedback

functional integrity, while potentially navigating tradeoffs between conserving species, habitat, and ecosystem services."], "sea level rise": ["The gradual increase in water level along the coast, driven by various factors, which threatens the delicate balance of coastal ecosystems by altering natural habitats and reducing their ability to adapt to other environmental changes, with potential consequences for the overall health and resilience of these ecologically vital areas.", "The gradual increase in the height of the waterline along a coastline, potentially caused by a combination of factors, including changes in global temperature and the melting of ice sheets, which can have devastating consequences for coastal ecosystems, such as salt marshes, that are already struggling to maintain their resilience in the face of numerous human-induced and natural disturbances.", "A gradual elevation of the coastline due to an accumulation of water on the surface of the Earth, which can compromise the ability of vulnerable ecosystems like salt marshes to adapt and thrive.", "The upward creep of water's domain, resulting in the gradual displacement of land-based ecosystems and the alteration of coastal dynamics, posing a significant threat to the resilience of fragile wetland environments.", "The increasing elevation of coastal waterlines due to the melting of polar ice caps and thermal expansion of seawater, which is projected to cause widespread damage to ecologically sensitive areas, such as salt marshes, unless proper conservation measures are taken."],

of a dynamic salt marsh system.", "An excessive and unnatural influx of nutrients in coastal ecosystems, which can disrupt the delicate balance of salt marshes, altering their ability to recover from disturbances and threatening their long-term sustainability.", "The excessive enrichment of coastal ecosystems, often driven by human activities, leading to a surge in the growth of aquatic plants, which can choke out native species and imperil the long-term health of these valuable ecosystems.", "The excessive supply of nutrients in a coastal ecosystem, which can lead to a surge in plant
