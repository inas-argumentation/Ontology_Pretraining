become a significant competitor for resources with indigenous species.", "A small, freshwater snail native to New Zealand, inadvertently introduced to the Laurentian Great Lakes through ship traffic, which may soon spread across the region, potentially displacing native species through competition for resources.", "A small, native freshwater snail from the Southern Hemisphere, introduced to North American waters through international trade, potentially threatening native species through resource competition, and highlighting the ongoing risk of aquatic invasive species invasions despite regulatory efforts.", "A small, shell-dwelling freshwater mollusk native to a distant land, but unexpectedly discovered in a vast inland water system, where it is likely to thrive and potentially outcompete native species for resources, and was likely introduced via the water carried by transoceanic vessels."], "exotic molluscs": ["Aquatic animals that have naturally originated from one region but have been transported to another, often through human activity, and have established a self-sustaining population in their new environment, potentially competing with native species for resources and posing a threat to the ecosystem's biodiversity.", "An alien species of freshwater shelled creatures that are not native to a region, often originating from other parts of the world, and have been introduced through human activity, potentially altering the local ecosystem and posing a threat to indigenous species.", "Species of shell-dwelling creatures, native to one region, that have been inadvertently transported to a new environment through human activity, where they can establish populations and potentially outcompete native species for resources.", "Species of non-native shell-bearing animals that have been introduced to a new geographic region, often through human activity, and can potentially outcompete native species for resources, causing ecological changes and

pose threats to native species and ecosystems."], "lake ontario": ["A vast, freshwater body situated between the Niagara Escarpment and the Canadian shores, known for its complex aquatic ecosystem and recent infestation by a New Zealand native mollusc species.", "A vast, interconnected freshwater system bordering the northern United States and southern Canada, where the arrival of non-native

located in a transcontinental region, home to a diverse array of aquatic life, with a recent history of unexpected arrivals from distant lands due to the increasing presence of international shipping
