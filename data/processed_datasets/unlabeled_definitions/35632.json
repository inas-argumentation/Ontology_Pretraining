stability and resilience of the environment.", "A measure of an ecosystem's overall health, encompassing the diversity, abundance, and coexistence of native and non-native species, as well as their interaction with their environment, which can indicate the degree to which an ecosystem is functioning optimally and supporting a rich web of life."], "motile invertebrates": ["Organisms that possess the ability to move and roam freely within their aquatic environment, often relying on their appendages, body shape, and specialized structures to navigate and settle in various habitats, such as algae-covered surfaces, where they can exploit resources and interact with other species.", "Species that inhabit and move about within a dynamic, changing environment, such as the brown seaweed Sargassum muticum, where they can thrive among its dense populations and exploit its sheltered nooks and crannies.", "Organisms that are capable of actively moving within their environment to find food, shelter, and mates, often with complex social interactions, and can thrive in a variety of aquatic ecosystems.", "A broad category of animals that are characterized by their ability to actively
