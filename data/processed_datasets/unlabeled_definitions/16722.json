to reach a state of independence, often in response to environmental stimuli that dictate optimal adaptation to their ecosystem.", "The gradual process of transformation and maturation, marked by a shift from reliance on external sustenance to autonomy, as an organism's physiology and behavior adapt to its environment and prepare it for its adult form, often influenced by factors such as temperature, predation pressure, and the presence of exotic species.", "The process by which immature organisms progressively attain their full functional capacity and adaptability to their environment, often subject to dynamic interactions with external stimuli and predators, which can either accelerate or impede this process.", "The complex and dynamic process by which juvenile
