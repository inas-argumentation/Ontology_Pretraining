convergence": ["The phenomenon where fish species in a community exhibit similarities in their characteristics, such as swimming ability or fin length, in response to changing environmental conditions, potentially as a result of adaptation to reduce competition or increase survival chances.", "A phenomenon in which the morphological, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of multiple fish species within a community tend to become more uniform over time in response to changing environmental conditions, leading to a loss of unique adaptations and specializations.", "The process by which the characteristics of individual fish species, once distinct, come to resemble each other in response to environmental pressures, leading to a loss of functional diversity and a more homogeneous community structure.", "The process by which similar responses to environmental pressures among fish individuals within a community result in the uniform adaptation of a subset of characteristics, leading to a narrowing of functional diversity and a reduction in the range of ecological niches occupied by the community.", "The process by which the distinct characteristics of fish populations adapt and become increasingly similar to one another over time, as a result of shared environmental pressures and selection forces, leading to a loss of diversity in functional
