tangible change in the distribution, frequency, or quality of ecological processes, structures, and relationships.", "The measurable effect of a species' presence or activity on the distribution, abundance, or ecological processes of a particular area, encompassing the varying magnitudes and locations of consequences across spatial scales."], "landscape ecology": ["The study of environmental interactions and processes that occur across varying spatial scales, from local to regional, with a focus on understanding how the complex arrangements of ecological components and their relationships shape the distribution of ecological phenomena and impacts.", "The study of the complex interactions between spatially distributed biological entities and their environments, with a focus on understanding how their collective patterns and processes unfold across heterogeneous areas to shape ecological outcomes and inform management strategies for optimal and targeted conservation

species distribution, and ecosystem function across multiple spatial scales, often with a focus on the management and mitigation of environmental change.", "The study of how organisms interact with and shape the spatial arrangement of natural systems, often involving the analysis of multiple factors that influence the distribution and impact of biological communities across vast areas, with a focus on understanding the complex relationships between local and broader scale effects.", "The study of how dynamic interactions among spatially-distributed elements, such as species populations and environmental factors, shape the patterns and processes of ecosystems across multiple scales, allowing for a nuanced understanding of how ecological changes accumulate and manifest at broader geographical scales."], "geographic range": ["The extent of an organism's spatial occupancy within a region, encompassing the boundaries within which it has successfully established a presence, often fluctuating in size due to factors such as abundance, habitat availability, and species interactions.", "The area over which a non-native species can be found, encompassing its most abundant and least abundant locations, and accounting for the varying densities of its presence.", "The area over which an organism's presence or influence extends, characterized by a spatial distribution that can be extensive or limited, and where its ecological effects may vary in intensity or manifestation.", "The aggregate spatial area within which a non-native species can be found, encompassing all locations where it has been detected or is predicted to occur, and influencing the extent and pattern of its local-scale impacts.", "The scope of an organism's territorial presence, encompassing the total area where it has been recorded or is known to exist, taking into account the irregularities and patchiness of its distribution across a heterogeneous landscape."], "invasive species prevention": ["The
