pattern around the initial site of infection, and may be surrounded by a halogenation effect.", "Discoloration patterns that appear on plant foliage, typically manifesting as small, distinct areas of altered pigmentation or tissue, which can expand and change color over time, often accompanied by the production of spores and potentially influenced by environmental factors.", "Small, dark lesions on plant leaves that can grow and spread over time, potentially causing discoloration and halo effects, often associated with fungal infections and characteristic of various plant diseases.",
