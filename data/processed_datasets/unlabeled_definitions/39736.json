being shaped by human activities, leading to a decrease in unique ecological characteristics and an increase in common traits and species.", "The varied assemblage of flora and fauna found in areas of human-dominated land use, characterized by a mix of native and non-native species that can lead to either a heightened sense of ecological resilience or a loss of regional distinctiveness.", "The degree of ecological diversity present in spaces where human development has altered the natural environment, characterized by the coexistence of native and non-native plant species that have adapted to the transformed landscape, often resulting in homogenization of communities in highly developed areas.", "The composition of plant and animal species in a built environment, shaped by the intensity

gradient": ["A measurable transition zone where the intensity of human activity and development progressively changes, resulting in a shift from natural environments to densely populated urban areas, which in turn affects the ecological characteristics of adjacent vacant lots.", "A gradual shift in the environment's natural character, marked by increasing human impact and influence, which manifests through a progressive transformation of vegetation and ecosystem composition, ultimately resulting in a loss of local unique features and an increased presence of non-native species.", "A transitional zone where the environmental characteristics of a natural ecosystem gradually change as a result of increasing levels of human occupation, leading to a mosaic of different ecological conditions that are shaped by the interplay between the existing native species and invasive non-native species.", "A gradual transition from a predominantly natural to a predominantly artificial environment, characterized by a continuous progression from the presence of native plant species to the dominance of non-native species, resulting in a shift from ecological complexity to

characteristic diversity of plant communities is reduced due to the replacement of native species with non-native ones, resulting in a loss of unique functional traits and increased similarity in
