native and invasive plant species.", "A type of infrastructure constructed along a river's course that creates a barrier to natural flow, altering the ecosystem's dynamics and allowing non-native species to thrive in previously dominant habitats."], "russian olive": ["A slender, thorny shrub-like tree with a preference for moist environments, known for its rapid spread and ability to displace native vegetation, often thriving in areas where it has been previously introduced or cultivated.", "A woody, non-native invasive species native to Central Asia, characterized by its ability to thrive in riparian habitats and displace native vegetation, often through the exploitation of favorable microclimates and the lack of effective predation pressure.", "A highly adaptable, deciduous tree native to Eastern Europe and Western Asia, now thriving in Western North America, where it can dominate riparian forests by replacing native cottonwoods, often facilitated by human activities and wildlife interactions.", "A woody shrub or small tree native to Europe, introduced to Western North America as an ornamental plant, but now considered invasive due to its ability to displace native riparian ecosystems and thrive in areas with altered habitats.", "A highly adaptable, invasive tree species native to Asia, widely distributed in western North America, often establishing itself in riparian areas and potentially replacing native vegetation through its ability to thrive in a variety of environments and tolerate damage from herbivores."], "cottonwoods": ["A species of riparian tree that typically thrives in areas with limited water flow, often relying on periodic establishment and regeneration in sandbars and low-lying terraces, and whose dominance may be influenced by ecological interactions with beavers and invasive plant species.", "A type of deciduous tree that, when native, forms a canopy in riparian zones, providing habitat and structural complexity, but is susceptible to alteration and replacement by invasive species when human activities or natural disturbances compromise its growth conditions.", "Trees that naturally occur in riparian zones, often forming dense stands along rivers, and are typically characterized by their ability to thrive in environments where vegetation is regularly pruned by beavers, although their growth can be limited by the animals' preferences for more palatable vegetation.", "A group of deciduous trees that once thrived along riversides, characterized by their robust canopies and ability to flourish in a variety of riparian habitats, but are now threatened by the encroachment of an invasive species, which increasingly dominates the landscape.", "Trees that are native to riparian zones and are often replaced by more opportunistic species due to environmental factors and ecological competition, leading to changes in the composition and structure of the riparian ecosystem."], "tree invasion": ["The gradual establishment and proliferation of a non-native plant species in a previously dominant ecosystem, often facilitated by human activity or environmental factors, leading to the displacement of native vegetation and alteration of ecological dynamics.", "The process by which a non-native, aggressive, and shade-tolerant plant colonizes and outcompetes native vegetation in riparian zones, often facilitated by altered habitat conditions and the absence of natural disturbance agents, ultimately leading to the degradation and transformation of the ecosystem.", "The proliferation of a non-native plant species, often facilitated by human activity, which establishes a dominant presence in an ecosystem, replacing native vegetation and altering its structure and function over time.", "The
