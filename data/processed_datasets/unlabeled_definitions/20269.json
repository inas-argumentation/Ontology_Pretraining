various arachnids, particularly a particular species of Tetranychus spider mites.", "A plant that is not cultivated or intentionally managed for food, fiber, or ornamental purposes, such as native species, invasive weeds, or trees grown for timber, but may still provide a habitat or resources for pests and diseases that affect crops.", "Plants that grow outside of agricultural fields and are not specifically cultivated for human consumption or commercial use, including indigenous species, invasive weeds, and introduced trees, which can serve as natural hosts for spider mites and other
