unforeseen consequences for the delicate balance of a vulnerable ecosystem.", "The western shoreline of a vast continent, characterized by a complex network of marine ecosystems that have been influenced by the passage of numerous vessels over the centuries, thereby facilitating the intentional and unintentional introduction of non-native species.", "The tropical coastline along the southeastern rim of the New World, where the gentle flow of freshwater from the Andes mountain range meets the warm waters of the Atlantic, creating a unique fusion of marine life and terrestrial influence.", "A region of the western hemisphere where the warm waters of the equatorial region meet the colder, oxygen-rich waters of the southeastern part of the world, giving rise to a unique blend of marine life that has been shaped by the intricate web of trade and migration routes that crisscross the globe.", "A region along the western fringe of the South American landmass, characterized by a mix of marine and terrestrial influences, where the tropical rainforests of the interior meet the rich biodiversity of the oceans, and where human activities such as international trade and exploration have led to the unintentional introduction of non-native species."], "non-indigenous species. resumo. ocorr\u00eancia do peixinho-pombo": ["A species that inhabits an environment foreign

natural habitat to a distant region, often inadvertently, and may disrupt the ecological balance of its new surroundings.", "A species that originates from a distant region, but is now found in a novel environment, often as a result of human activities such as trade or travel, where it may potentially alter the native ecosystem and pose a threat to its balance.", "A species of fish that originates from a distant region and has unintentionally been transported to a new environment, potentially disrupting the native ecosystem, and often requiring a peculiar type of camouflage, such as
