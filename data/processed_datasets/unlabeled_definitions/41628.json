tree species renowned for its edible nuts, whose forest ecosystem is often threatened by an invasive insect species that induces the formation of various galls on its branches.", "A deciduous tree species widely cultivated for its edible nuts, often forming dense stands in woodlands, and susceptible to damage by invasive pests that induce gall formation on its foliage.", "A deciduous tree species native to Eurasia, renowned for its edible nuts and distinctive, sprawling canopy, which can now be found entwined with an unwelcome guest in the form of a gall-forming insect."], "north caucasus": ["A region of southern Russia characterized by a rich biodiversity, with dense forests that are home to various tree species, including sweet chestnut, which is under threat from invasive

parasitic wasps that induce abnormal growths or distortions in tree leaves or stems, often forming rounded, waxy or woody structures that can significantly alter the plant's appearance and affect its growth."]}
