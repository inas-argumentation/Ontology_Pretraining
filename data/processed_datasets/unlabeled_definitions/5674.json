between various factors, such as population dynamics, environmental conditions, and ecological traits.", "The process of analyzing incomplete or uncertain data to derive reliable conclusions about complex ecological phenomena, such as the likelihood of an introduced species establishing itself in a new environment, by carefully considering the interactions between various factors and their inherent uncertainties.", "The process of extracting reliable conclusions from incomplete or uncertain information, taking into account the various factors that influence the outcome, in order to inform decision-making and reduce uncertainty.", "The process of using available information to make educated conclusions about a complex event or outcome, despite the presence of uncertainty and variability, by systematically accounting for the various factors that can influence its probability.", "The process of drawing reliable conclusions from incomplete or biased data, taking into account the uncertain nature of ecological interactions and the imperfections in our understanding of the introduced species' ecological traits, in order to make informed predictions about the probability of a species establishing and potentially becoming invasive in a new environment."], "stochasticity in population growth and parameter uncertainty can lead to large differences in the estimated probability of establishment. the effects of these factors can be substantial": ["The unpredictable variations in the outcome of a population's growth or a system's behavior, driven by inherent uncertainties and limited information, can result in considerable discrepancies between predicted and actual outcomes, highlighting the critical importance of considering these variations in making accurate predictions.", "The inherent variability in the trajectory of population growth, combined with the limitations of knowledge about the underlying ecological factors, can result in significant disparities in the predicted likelihood of a newly introduced species gaining a foothold in a new environment, leading to substantial variations in the perceived risk of its potential impact.", "Uncertainty in the outcome of introducing a new species can arise from the unpredictable nature of population growth and the lack of precise knowledge about key ecological factors, resulting in significant variations in the predicted likelihood of the species taking hold.", "Unpredictable variations in the factors influencing the spread and survival of a newly introduced species can lead to considerable disparities in the likelihood of its establishment, making it challenging to accurately forecast its future trajectory.", "Unforeseeable variations in the growth dynamics of a newly introduced species, combined with incomplete knowledge of its ecological characteristics, can result in significant discrepancies in the predicted likelihood of establishment."], "demographic stochasticity and uncertainty in the parameter values describing the population dynamics of an introduced species can substantially increase the variance of our prediction of establishment": ["The degree to which the inherent unpredictability of population growth and the limitations in understanding the dynamics of an introduced species can significantly amplify the spread of uncertainty in forecasts of whether the species will successfully establish itself.", "The unpredictable nature of a new species' initial population growth, caused by inherent biological and environmental variability, can significantly broaden the range of possible outcomes for its successful establishment, thereby undermining the accuracy of predictions regarding its spread.", "The unpredictability resulting from the complexity of interactions between a small number of introduced individuals and their surrounding environment, combined with the limitations of incomplete and potentially biased field observations and uncertainties in the ecological characteristics of the introduced species, can significantly increase the uncertainty of predicting whether the introduced population will successfully establish itself.", "The unpredictability of the outcome when a non-native species is introduced into a new environment can be significantly amplified by the inherent randomness of population growth and the uncertainty surrounding the key factors that influence its spread, leading to a wider range of possible outcomes for the species' ability to establish itself.", "The unpredictability in the population's growth trajectory caused by uncertainties in the interactions between the introduced species and the resident community, as well as imperfections in the knowledge of the ecological traits of the introduced species, resulting in a range of possible outcomes for the species' establishment."]}
