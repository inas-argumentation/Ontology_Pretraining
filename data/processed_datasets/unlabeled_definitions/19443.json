consequences of invasive species arrival."], "ladybird declines": ["A significant and sustained reduction in the distribution, abundance, or diversity of native species in a particular ecosystem, often attributed to the competitive or predatory pressure exerted by an invasive alien species.", "A phenomenon where the populations of native insects, characterized by their bright colors and distinct patterns, experience a significant reduction in numbers and distribution, potentially leading to the displacement of native species by invasive alien predators and competitors, and thereby threatening the ecological balance and diversity of ecosystems.", "A significant reduction in the population and geographic distribution of a native species of beetle, often accompanied by a concurrent increase in the presence and dominance of an invasive non-native predator-prey competitor, resulting in ecological disruption and potential loss of biodiversity.", "The sudden and sustained reduction in the population and distribution of certain indigenous beetle species, often characterized by a shift in dominance from native to invasive species, resulting in a decline in biodiversity

volunteer contributions and leveraging local knowledge to gather insights on changes in population distributions and abundances.", "A collaborative data collection approach that harnesses the
