environments, often outcompeting native species and posing a threat to local ecosystems due to its rapid naturalization.", "A plant species characterized by its adaptability to thrive in disturbed environments, with potential to outcompete native flora and alter ecosystem dynamics."], "naturalization status": ["The process by which a non-native plant species becomes well-established and reproduces in a new region, often leading to a stable and self-sustaining population that can potentially displace or outcompete native flora.", "The state of becoming a established and self-sustaining part of a new ecosystem, characterized by a species' ability to thrive and reproduce in a non-native environment without direct human intervention, often resulting in a potential threat to the existing flora and habitat.", "The point at which a non-native species has established a self-sustaining population in a new environment, where it is able to reproduce and thrive, often without the need for continued human introduction, while potentially competing with native flora and modifying its ecological surroundings.", "The stage at which a non-native plant species, after initial introduction to a new environment, begins to thrive and establish a self-sustaining population, often outcompeting native species for resources and habitat.", "The process by which a non-native species, which has established a self-sustaining population in a given region, gradually adapts to its new environment and becomes an integral part of its ecological landscape, potentially

region, marking a new chapter in the local flora and often bringing with it potential ecological concerns."], "ageratina ligustrina": ["A perennial herbaceous plant that, while sharing similarities with some native Italian flora, has naturalized in the country, posing potential threats to native ecosystems and habitats, and requires careful consideration for its ecological impact.", "A flowering plant native to certain regions, known for its tendency to adapt to new environments and potentially outcompete native flora, with a morphology that is often distinguishable from related species.", "A prickly perennial plant of Eastern Asia, often found in disturbed habitats, characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which can pose a threat to native ecosystems and biodiversity.", "A perennial plant native to a specific region, characterized by its adaptability to thrive in a wide range of environments, often outcompeting native species for resources, and potentially threatening local ecosystems.", "A type of invasive weed that has colonized Italian flora, characterized by its ability to naturalize in new environments and threaten the habitat and native plant species of the region."]}
