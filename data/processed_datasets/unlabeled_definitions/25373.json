in ecosystems as both consumers and prey.", "Amphibians that belong to a group of jumping or leaping species, characterized by their unique ability to thrive in a wide range of environments and exhibiting selective breeding habits, with some species being highly adaptable and potentially invasive."], "water quality": ["The complex interplay of physical and chemical attributes of a waterbody that influence the suitability and selectivity of breeding sites for certain species, such as toads, and can be used to inform management strategies for coexistence or control of invasive populations.", "The ecological compatibility of a aquatic environment's physical attributes and chemical conditions, which enables or hinders the selection of suitable breeding sites by target species.", "The physical and chemical properties of an aquatic environment that affect the habitat preferences and reproductive success of its inhabitants, encompassing factors such as bank morphology, water depth, and chemical composition, among others.", "The physical and chemical attributes of aquatic environments that can influence the reproductive success of certain species, including the choice of breeding sites and the suitability of microhabitats for individual animals.", "The chemical and physical characteristics of an aquatic environment that influence the selection and utilization of breeding sites by both invasive and native species, potentially affecting the dynamics of their reproduction and ecological interactions."], "microhabitat use": ["The subtle manipulation of environmental features at a highly local scale to achieve specific physiological, behavioral, or reproductive advantages, such as exploiting ideal water depths, substrate textures, or sheltered areas.", "The specific characteristics of a site, often small-scale and subtle, that an animal takes into account when selecting a location for a particular behavior or activity, such as breeding, calling, or foraging, which can influence the likelihood of its presence or success.", "The specific arrangements of vegetation, water features, and structural elements within a specific environment that an individual or group of animals utilize to meet their immediate needs, such as foraging, shelter, or reproduction, often demonstrating a level of selectivity and preference for certain characteristics.", "The way in which an animal occupies and utilizes a specific, often small, portion of its environment, often with preferences for certain characteristics such as water depth, vegetation cover, or slope, and which may be used for a particular life stage or behavior, such as mating or breeding.", "The specific arrangements and features of a localized environment, such as vegetation, water depth, or substrate, that attract and influence the behavior of particular organisms during critical life stages, like breeding or foraging, and which can vary significantly within a larger ecosystem."], "pond": ["A body of standing water, characterized by a degree of stillness and shallow depth, typically surrounded by a terrestrial environment and serving as a habitat for various aquatic organisms.", "A body of still or slow-moving water, often featuring gentle banks and varying levels of water depth, which serves as a preferred breeding ground for certain amphibians and is characterized by its tendency to attract a disproportionate number of non-native invasive species.", "A body of water characterized by a relatively small size, gentle sloping banks, and suitable water chemistry, often selected as a breeding site by certain invasive or native species.", "A small, shallow body of still or slowly-moving water that provides a microhabitat for amphibians, typically characterized by gently sloping banks and shallow water, often used as a breeding site by cane toads and other anurans.", "A small, shallow body of still or slow-moving water, often characterized by gently sloping banks and suitable for amphibian breeding, which may be targeted for management to mitigate the impact of invasive species."], "habitat selection": ["The process by which an organism chooses specific locations with favorable conditions that optimize its reproductive success, while demonstrating a preference for certain environmental characteristics that may influence the survival and development of its offspring.", "The process by which an organism chooses and occupies a specific environment or set of environments that meet its physiological, behavioral, and reproductive needs, often demonstrating preferences for certain features such as terrain, water quality, or microclimates.", "The process by which a species favors certain environments or micro-environments for reproduction, seemingly guided by specific conditions that maximize the chances of successful breeding and offspring survival, while also differentiating itself from other
