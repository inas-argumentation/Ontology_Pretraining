vegetation, and a dramatic decline in insect abundance during the summer months, only to experience an unexpected resurgence in autumn.", "Regions above 3,000 meters where extreme environmental conditions, such as harsh temperatures and scarce resources, create a challenging habitat that is often characterized by unique and endemic plant species.", "Regions where the air is thinner and the warmth of the sun is tempered, allowing native species to thrive in isolation, but also vulnerable to the sudden appearance of invaders from lower altitudes, which find refuge in these elevated areas to escape the scorching temperatures of the summer months.", "Areas of elevated terrain where atmospheric conditions are less hospitable to certain species, yet still teeming with endemic flora and fauna, and where the introduction of invasive alien species can have far-reaching implications for local biodiversity.", "Region situated above a threshold, where environmental conditions become increasingly challenging due to reduced oxygen levels, reduced plant diversity, and a limited capacity for species to adapt, often hosting unique endemic species that are vulnerable to disruptions from invasive alien species."], "high altitude": ["Regions above average elevations, where atmospheric conditions become increasingly challenging for most organisms, but are surprisingly teeming with life, with some species even thriving in these unique environments.", "The upper limits of a mountainous region where air pressure is significantly lower and vegetation is characterized by unique adaptations to extreme temperature fluctuations, allowing for the persistence of species that have evolved to thrive in environments with limited resources.", "Areas where the environment is uniquely challenged by a combination of intense sunlight and thin atmospheric layers, requiring adaptations in the native fauna and flora to thrive.", "A region beyond the reach of most living organisms, characterized by reduced oxygen levels, extreme temperatures, and unique native species adapted to harsh conditions, where only the hardiest of species can thrive.", "The elevations at which the air grows cooler, vegetation becomes stunted, and the pressure is lower, yet still supports the survival of certain species, even those not adapted to extreme conditions, and is often characterized by a
