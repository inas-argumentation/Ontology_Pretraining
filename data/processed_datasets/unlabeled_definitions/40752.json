allowing it to capitalize on its superior fitness or unique adaptations to occupy a previously shared ecological niche.", "The phenomenon whereby the removal or alleviation of constraints imposed by competition within a species allows a non-native species to gain a competitive advantage over native species, often by releasing resources or reducing costs that would otherwise be spent on intraspecific competition.", "When an individual or population of a species, previously constrained by the limitations and costs of intraspecific competition, achieves a significant competitive advantage by eliminating or significantly reducing such competition, thereby freeing up resources and allowing them to focus on outcompeting native species for resources and habitat.", "The phenomenon
