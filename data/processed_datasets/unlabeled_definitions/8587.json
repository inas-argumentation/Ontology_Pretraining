outcompeting native species and/or causing significant economic or environmental harm, often becoming an integral part of the ecosystem's structure and functioning, despite being non-native.", "A type of non-native plant that usurps the ecological role of native species in a receiving environment, often with significant consequences for the recipient ecosystem's stability, biodiversity, and economic activities, and whose establishment and spread are driven by a combination of biological and environmental factors that can be difficult to predict."], "nonindigenous": ["A species that has

or harmfully.", "Species that, through human intervention or other means, find themselves in an ecosystem that is not their native habitat, often resulting in a significant impact on the local ecosystem's balance and potentially displacing native species or causing economic harm.", "A species that originates from elsewhere and gains a foothold in an ecosystem, often altering its dynamics, potentially outcompeting native species, and posing a risk to the environment and human activities.", "A species that is not native to a region, having likely arrived through human activity, and can potentially alter the ecological balance or economy of its new environment, even if its impact is currently unknown.", "A species that enters a new ecosystem through human activity, and whose subsequent growth or presence can have a significant impact on the native flora and fauna, often outcompeting or replacing established species, and potentially causing economic or environmental harm."], "marine flora": ["The complex network of non-animal organisms that inhabit and shape the underwater environment, comprising a diverse array of species that play crucial roles in structuring ecosystems and influencing biodiversity, with some newcomers posing a significant threat to native ecological balance and human activities.", "The diverse assemblage of aquatic plant life found in the
