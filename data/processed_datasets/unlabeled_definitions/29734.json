environments, including coastal regions, rivers, and urban areas, often being transported and dispersed through human activities such as trade, travel, and environmental degradation."],

previously geographically isolated.", "The increasing encroachment of human activity on natural habitats, leading to the disruption of geographical barriers and the creation of new pathways for the introduction and spread of non-native species.", "The gradual transformation of natural habitats and ecosystems into human-dominated environments, resulting in increased connectivity and facilitation of species migration and dispersal across previously isolated regions, often precipitating novel ecological interactions and invasions.", "The rapid transformation of natural habitats into modified environments, characterized by increased human presence and activity, which can lead to the breakdown of geographical barriers and facilitate the movement and establishment of non-native species.",
