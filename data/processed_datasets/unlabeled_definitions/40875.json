effect": ["The phenomenon by which the timing of an event's occurrence affects its subsequent trajectory, leading to altered patterns of behavior, stability, or persistence in a dynamic system.", "The subtle yet crucial influence that the passage of time exerts on the rate of progression, momentum, or stability of a system's dynamics, where the lagging effect of this influence can often have a

instabilities in complex systems that undergo a gradual transition from a stable state to a new equilibrium.", "The phenomenon where the timing of events affects the outcome, leading to a temporal lag

through a medium, influenced by its own presence and the presence of other entities or factors in the surrounding environment, with the added consideration of the time lag between the cause and effect of various events and interactions.", "A system of interacting processes that exhibits a dynamic interplay between spatial dispersion and temporal lag, where the latter influences the former's propagation and affects the stability and behavior of the system as a whole.", "A mathematical representation of the spread of a spreading agent, such as a plant, over a spatial domain, where the rate
