activities such as growth, development, or reproduction, which can vary depending on factors like environmental temperature and geographical distribution.", "The intrinsic energy expenditure of an organism when it is not actively engaged in locomotion, feeding, or other physically demanding activities, and is instead expending energy to maintain its bodily functions, such as maintaining body temperature and basic physiological processes, across varying thermal environments.", "The rate at which a living organism's fundamental physiological processes, such as energy maintenance and cellular functions, are carried out when it is not actively engaged in external activities, and is instead in a state of dormancy or quiescence, influenced by factors like environmental temperature and geographic origin.", "The rate at which an organism's internal physiological processes operate when it is in a state of inactivity, revealing its inherent efficiency in using energy resources for survival, and potentially influencing its ability to adapt to varying environmental conditions."], "thermal sensitivity": ["The capacity of an organism's physiological processes to respond to changes in environmental temperature, influencing its ability to maintain homeostasis and adapt to differing thermal conditions throughout its geographic range.", "The organism's ability to adjust its physiological processes, such as metabolic rate, in response to varying environmental temperatures, allowing it to maintain homeostasis and optimal function within its native or invaded range.", "The degree to which an organism's physiological functions, particularly its metabolic rate, are influenced by changes in environmental temperature, and is often affected by adaptation to specific thermal regimes.", "The degree to which an organism's physiological processes respond to changes in environmental temperature, particularly in situations where temperature gradients occur across its geographical range.", "The degree to which an organism's physiological processes, such as metabolic rate, are influenced by the temperature of its environment, resulting in adjustments that enable the organism to maintain homeostasis and cope with environmental stress."], "lymantria dispar": ["A highly adaptable, heat-loving, and ecologically significant insect that has successfully spread across North America, exhibiting diverse physiological responses to varying environmental temperatures, and continues to pose a threat to regional ecosystems despite its established presence.", "A migratory moth with a voracious appetite and adaptability to varying climates, capable of spreading rapidly across North America and exploiting resources in its path, while exhibiting resilience in the face of shifting environmental conditions.", "A highly adaptable and widespread invasive insect capable of thriving in diverse environmental conditions, often exhibiting variations in physiological traits across its range, and whose ability to adapt to changing thermal regimes has significant implications for its potential for further spatial spread.", "A significant and widespread invasive species known for its remarkable ability to adapt to varying environmental conditions, yet exhibits surprisingly consistent physiological responses to temperature fluctuations across its vast geographic range, with its larvae demonstrating a keen ability to thrive in a variety of thermal regimes.", "A widespread and voracious forest pest, known to thrive in a diverse range of climates and ecosystems, exhibiting a remarkable ability to adapt to its environment through physiological mechanisms that govern its metabolic rate, but showing little signs of thermal specialization at its range boundaries."], "gypsy moth": ["A deciduous-forest dwelling, thermally sensitive insect capable of rapid population expansion across varied climates, whose ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions is a crucial factor in determining its invasive capabilities.", "A species of moth that, having been introduced to a new continent, has thrived in various climatic conditions, showcasing adaptability, but with its metabolic rate demonstrating a uniform response to temperature changes, regardless of geographical origin or environmental acclimation.", "A certain invasive, winged pest species notorious for its ability to thrive in a wide range of climates, exhibiting little adaptation to cold temperatures, and whose rapid population growth and dissemination are greatly influenced by its thermally plastic metabolic rate.", "A terrestrial insect native to Europe, but now widespread in North America, known for its voracious appetite for leaves and forests, with a unique ability to thrive in a variety of climatic conditions, from the warmth of southern regions to the chilly temperatures of northern habitats, its physiological adaptations allowing it to maintain a consistent metabolic rate despite environmental changes, while its invasive nature poses a significant threat to local ecosystems.", "A species of caterpillar with a remarkable ability to adapt to diverse thermal environments, whose spread across North America has been marked by a range of local physiological responses to its introduced range."], "acclimation": ["The physiological process by which an ectothermic organism adjusts its internal physiological state to maintain homeostasis in response to variations in environmental temperature, allowing it to thrive in a range of thermal conditions.", "The process by which an organism, typically an ectotherm, adjusts its physiological traits in response to changing environmental conditions, allowing it to maintain a stable internal environment while adapting to a specific thermal regime.", "The process by which ectotherms, such as insects, adjust their physiological traits to maintain homeostasis in response to thermal stressors, typically exhibiting changes in metabolic rate and other physiological responses as they adapt to diverse environmental conditions.", "The process by which an organism's physiological responses to environmental stimuli, such as temperature, adaptively adjust to maintain homeostasis within its tolerable range, enabling it to thrive in its native or introduced habitat despite the presence of diverse thermal regimes.", "The physiological process by which an organism adjusts its internal physiology to conform to the prevailing thermal conditions of its environment, thereby enabling it to maintain optimal metabolic function and maintain a stable internal state despite changes in external temperature."]}
