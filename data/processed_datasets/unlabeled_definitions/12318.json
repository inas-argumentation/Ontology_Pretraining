of local ecosystems.", "Organisms of small to moderate size, typically featuring jointed limbs and segmented bodies, which have adapted to occupy various ecological niches and are often facilitated or hindered by human activities.", "Small, winged creatures that have colonized numerous regions worldwide, often inadvertently introduced by human activities and now inhabiting diverse environments,

organisms beyond their initial point of establishment, often facilitated by human activities such as trade, travel, or other forms of global connectivity, resulting in the colonization of new areas and potential ecological and economic impacts.", "The process by which alien insect species, often facilitated by human activities and changes in global connectivity, suddenly and rapidly expand their geographic range, propelled by natural and anthropogenic forces that enable them to travel long distances, often exceeding local dispersal capacities, and leading to the establishment of new populations in previously uninhabited or underserved areas.", "The process by which organisms, typically introduced through human activities, quickly and rapidly expand their geographic range and population distribution, often facilitated by transportation networks, trade, and economic exchanges, resulting in a rapid colonization of new habitats and ecosystems.", "The process by which non-native species, often facilitated by human activities such as trade and travel, migrate rapidly across vast distances to establish new populations in a foreign environment, often with significant ecological and economic impacts.", "The phenomenon by which non-native organisms, often introduced through human activities, rapidly colonize new territories and expand their geographical ranges, facilitated by mechanisms such as global trade, travel, and changes in international politics, which enables them to bypass natural barriers and migrate over vast distances in a relatively short period."], "globalization": ["The increased interconnectedness and exchange of goods, services, and ideas across international boundaries, which has led to a surge in the transfer of species and cultures, resulting in a heightened risk of ecological disruptions and economic impacts.", "The process by which the increased exchange and interaction of species, goods, and ideas between different regions and ecosystems accelerates the spread and establishment of non-native species, leading to a rapidly changing ecological landscape.", "The process by which various components of the natural world, including species, are rapidly and frequently transferred across geographic boundaries, often facilitated by human activities such as trade and travel, resulting in increased ecological connectivity and the potential for unforeseen consequences.", "The increasingly interconnected and interdependent nature of human societies, economies, and trade networks, resulting in the rapid exchange of goods, services, and ideas across the globe, and ultimately facilitating the uncontrolled movement of invasive species and the expansion of their geographic ranges.", "The increased interconnectedness of the world's ecosystems, facilitated by human activities and technological advancements, has led to a widespread and accelerated transfer of organisms, ideas, and resources across borders, resulting in the reshaping of global ecological dynamics and the creation of novel invasive species."], "range size": ["The spatial extent of an alien insect species' ecological footprint in Europe, calculated as the square root of the total area it has invaded, divided by its rate of spread from the point of first detection.", "The maximum distance from the point of initial introduction that a non-native insect species has expanded, calculated as the square root of the total area it has invaded, providing an estimate of its ability to disperse and colonize new territories.", "The total spatial extent of an introduced insect population's ecological presence in Europe, spanning the distance from the initial point of establishment to the furthest edge of its current geographic distribution.", "The measure of the maximum distance an invasive species is able to expand and disperse its presence over a given period of time, often influenced by factors such as human activity, ecological adaptations, and geographical barriers.", "The extent to which an invasive species spreads its presence across a region, measured by the distance it has traveled from its initial introduction, which serves as a proxy for its ecological footprint and potential impact."], "establishment": ["The initial colonization of a new territory by a non-native species, marked by the presence of a small, scattered population that eventually grows and expands through a process facilitated by human activities and environmental factors, resulting in a gradual increase in its geographic range.", "The point at which an insect species, accidentally or intentionally introduced, becomes a permanent resident in a new region, often marked by the formation of a self-sustaining population that is capable of spreading and adapting to its new environment.", "The point at which an alien insect species starts to progressively expand its territory within Europe, marking the beginning of its ecological presence and potential impact.", "The point in time when a non-native species begins to occupy a new geographic area, following its initial introduction through human activity or natural means, and subsequently expands its range over time.", "The process by which a non-native species, often as a result of human activity, becomes a permanent and self-sustaining presence in a new geographic area, such as a continent or region."], "residence time": ["The duration over which a non-native species remains in a new environment before it reaches its maximum distribution, determined by factors such as the frequency and intensity of human activities, environmental conditions, and interactions with the native biota.", "The length of time during which a non-native insect species has been present in a region, having had the opportunity to establish a foothold and potentially alter local ecosystems before its subsequent spread.", "The amount of time elapsed since an exotic species initially gained a foothold in a new region, during which its population size, distribution, and impact on the native ecosystem gradually develop and stabilize.", "The length of time an introduced species has been present in a new environment before it starts to show a natural decline in its rate of expansion, often marked by a decrease in the speed at which it colonizes new areas.", "The duration for which a species maintains its presence and distribution in a new region, measured by its ability to establish a stable range and withstand ecological pressures, ultimately reflecting the species' adaptability to its new environment."]}
