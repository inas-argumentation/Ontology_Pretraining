thrive by reducing the intensity of competition with introduced species.", "An environment with intricate arrangements of natural features, characterized by a high degree of spatial heterogeneity, offering various levels of cover, shelter, and complexity that can accommodate a diverse array of species and foster niche partitioning, thereby influencing the intensity of interspecific

substrate heterogeneity, providing multiple pathways for individuals to navigate and settle, which allows native species to coexist with introduced species through reduced competitive pressure.", "An environment featuring an abundance of physical obstacles and heterogeneous microhabitats, which allows native species to seek refuge and exploit niches that are less accessible to invasive competitors, thereby reducing the intensity of interspecific competition."], "replacement of native species": ["The phenomenon where an indigenous species is gradually supplanted by a non-native species in a shared environment, often driven by competition for limited resources, and resulting in the decline or extinction of the native species' population.", "The process of a dominant non-native species gradually displacing its native counterpart from its ecological niche, typically resulting in the decline or even extinction of the native population, often in response to changes in environmental conditions or the presence of invasive competitors.", "The process of native species being gradually displaced by non-native species, often leading to a decline in population size and ultimately, a loss of ecological dominance, typically driven by factors such as competition for limited resources and habitat utilization.", "The displacement of a previously dominant species by a newly introduced species, which may result in reduced populations or even local extinctions, often driven by changes in environmental conditions and competition for resources.", "The process of a non-native species gradually dominating the ecological niche of a native species, often resulting in a decline or local extinction of the native species due to competition for resources and habitat modification."], "interspecific interaction": ["The process by which the ecological niches of different species overlap and influence each other, resulting in reciprocal impacts that can either
