preservation or protection, revealing the hidden costs of its degradation or loss.", "The process of quantifying the perceived value of environmental or ecological services and threats that do not involve direct monetary transactions, but rather assesses the willingness of individuals to pay for their preservation or protection, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of their societal
