and even extinctions.", "A non-native aquatic species that excels in its ability to exploit and dominate its new environment, often leading to the displacement and decline of native species with complex life cycles, where predation of aquatic larvae and avoidance of fish-occupied waterbodies can have distinct and confounding impacts on the affected species."], "fish predation": ["The feeding behavior of aquatic predators on vulnerable stages of a species' life cycle, where the predator's presence in a habitat may lead to significant declines in the population of the prey species, especially when the prey is unable to avoid or escape the predator's attack.", "The predation of aquatic larvae by a highly aggressive and successful invasive species, which may have significant community-level impacts, exacerbating the decline of threatened amphibians.", "The process by which a predator organism in an aquatic environment, characterized by aggressive behavior and rapid population growth, exploits and depletes the populations of multiple native species, including vulnerable aquatic larvae, by actively hunting and consuming them, ultimately disrupting the ecosystem's delicate balance.", "The process by which an invasive aquatic species, characterized by its aggressive behavior and widespread distribution, disproportionately affects the population dynamics of a native aquatic organism, particularly at the larval stage, potentially leading to significant declines in population abundance.", "The consumptive interaction between a dominant, aggressive, and opportunistic aquatic species and a vulnerable, herbivorous or omnivorous aquatic life stage, which may result in a reduction of the latter's population size and potentially drive the decline of a dependent terrestrial species."], "habitat selection": ["The process by which certain organisms tend to occupy and utilize specific environments, often characterized by the absence or presence of particular predator-prey dynamics, which in turn influences their population structure, distribution, and overall fitness.", "The deliberate or incidental avoidance of specific environmental conditions or zones by an organism, often driven by the presence of predators, competitors, or pathogens, and influencing the distribution and abundance of that organism's life stages or populations.", "The process by which an organism chooses or avoids specific aquatic or terrestrial environments, often based on the presence or absence of predators, competitors, or other organisms that affect its survival, growth, or reproduction.", "The process by which certain species choose to occupy or avoid specific aquatic or terrestrial areas based on their perceived risks and benefits, ultimately influencing their chances of survival, growth, and reproduction, often in response to the presence of other organisms, such as invasive predators.", "The process by which organisms choose or avoid certain environments or microsites within their ecosystem, often based on factors such as predation pressure, availability of food and shelter, and competition with other species, thereby influencing their survival, growth, and reproduction."], "mosquito fish": ["A prolific and invasive aquatic species characterized by its aggressive nature and ability to outcompete native fauna for resources, with a particular focus on feeding on aquatic larvae and potentially hindering the survival and recruitment of certain amphibian species.", "A highly invasive, aggressive, and adaptable
