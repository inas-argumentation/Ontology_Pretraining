of land previously cultivated for agriculture, left untended and allowed to revert to their natural state, often characterized by the gradual recolonization of native vegetation and species.", "Areas of land that were previously cultivated or maintained, but have been left to revert to their natural state over time, allowing native vegetation to re-establish and recolonize the area, often guided by the presence of nearby undisturbed grasslands."], "abandoned paddock": ["An area of land that has been previously cultivated for a specific purpose, but has been left untended and is now being reclaimed by native vegetation, allowing the natural ecosystem to reestablish itself over time.", "A field of previously cultivated land that has been left to revert to its natural state, allowing native plant species to recolonize and recover over time, potentially regaining a similar composition to nearby remnant ecosystems.", "A parcel of land that has been previously cultivated but has been left untended, allowing native plant species to recolonize and recover their natural diversity over time, with the likelihood of native grasses and forbs returning to dominate the community.", "An area of land that has ceased to be actively used for farming or other intensive human activities, allowing natural processes to resume and native vegetation to recolonize and recover over time, with potential for the establishment of a self-sustaining ecosystem resembling a nearby, intact natural grassland.", "A tract of land that has ceased to be cultivated and has reverted to a natural state, allowing native plant species to recolonize and potentially return to a state reminiscent of nearby unaltered grasslands."], "chronosequence": ["A sequential study of ecological changes over time,
