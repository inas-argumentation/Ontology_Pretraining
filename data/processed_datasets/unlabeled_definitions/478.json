transmission of specific pathogens, often by carrying and disseminating viral particles through its saliva or other bodily secretions, posing a potential risk to public health in a given region.", "The inherent ability of an arthropod to efficiently acquire, disseminate, and transmit viruses from one individual to another, often characterized by its capacity to support viral replication and withstand subsequent immune responses.", "The ability of a mosquito or other insect to efficiently transmit viruses or other pathogens from one host to another, determined by factors such as the mosquito's susceptibility to infection, the amount of virus present in its saliva, and its biting behavior, which can influence the risk of transmission of disease-causing pathogens to humans."],
