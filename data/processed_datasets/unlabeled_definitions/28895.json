removal or significant reduction of foliage, resulting in a plant's ability to rapidly redirect its resources to compensate for the loss and promote continued growth and regrowth, potentially leading to altered carbohydrate storage and structural development patterns.", "The act of removing or destroying the leaves of a plant, thereby forcing it to redirect its energy and resources away from growth and towards regeneration and survival, often resulting in altered allocation patterns for carbohydrate storage and regrowth.", "The removal or stripping away of the green, edible parts of a plant, often leading to a reduction in its ability to store energy-rich compounds, and potentially altering its growth and regrowth patterns in response to subsequent challenges or disturbances.",
