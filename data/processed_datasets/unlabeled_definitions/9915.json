{"waiting time": ["The period of time elapsed between the introduction of a non-indigenous species and its establishment in a new habitat, encompassing the interval between the initial invasion attempt and the species' successful colonization.", "The duration between the potential arrival of a non-indigenous species and its actual establishment in a new habitat, governed by factors such as the intensity of introduction efforts and the adaptability of the species to its new environment.", "The period elapsed between the initial introduction of a nonindigenous species and its establishment in a new location, encompassing the duration of uncertainty and vulnerability before the species' population becomes self-sustaining.", "The duration between the introduction of a non-indigenous species and its establishment in a new environment, representing the period of uncertainty and susceptibility to ecological disruption prior to the successful colonization of a new range.", "The interval of time elapsed between the introduction of a non-native organism to a new habitat and the establishment of a sustainable population, reflecting the probability of survival and propagation pressure factors."], "arrival": ["The onset of a non-native entity's entry into a novel environment, initiated by the introduction of a small number of individuals, which sets in motion a chain of events that can culminate in the entity's establishment and potential dominance.", "The point in time at which a non-native entity, carried or introduced through various means, finally reaches a new environment, often marking the beginning of its potential colonization and impact on the native ecosystem.", "The moment at which a non-indigenous entity begins its presence in a new geographic area, marked by a threshold of establishment where it can persist and potentially expand its range, following a process of introduction, dispersal, and colonization.", "The point in time when an organism, introduced by human activity, first reaches a new geographic location, marking the beginning of its potential to establish a viable population.", "The moment when an individual or a group of organisms begins to manifest their presence in a new geographic location, potentially initiating the establishment of a population in that environment."], "survival probability": ["The likelihood of a introduced entity successfully enduring the initial stages of colonization in a new environment, without succumbing to mortality or decline, thus increasing its chances of establishing a viable presence.", "The likelihood that a newly introduced individual of a nonindigenous species will persist in a novel environment, undeterred by ecological and environmental challenges, long enough to establish a self-sustaining population.", "The likelihood of a newly introduced individual persisting in its novel environment, free from factors that would lead to its demise, such as competition, predation, or inadequate resources.", "The likelihood that an introduced individual or population can thrive in a new environment, successfully adapting to existing conditions and overcoming the challenges of establishing a foothold.", "The likelihood that a non-indigenous species introduced into a new environment will successfully adapt and thrive, accounting for various biological, environmental, and ecological factors that influence its ability to establish a sustainable population."], "establishment": ["The arrival and persistence of a non-native population at a new location, marked by the successful colonization of the area and the establishment of a self-sustaining presence that can thrive and spread without reliance on continued human introduction.", "The successful colonization and proliferation of a non-native organism in a novel environment, marked by the formation of a sustainable population that alters the native ecological dynamics.", "The process by which a non-native population becomes self-sustaining in a new environment, where the population's size and growth rate stabilize, and the individuals' ability to adapt and reproduce in the new habitat is no longer dependent on the initial introduction.", "The successful integration of a non-native organism into a new environment, marked by a stable and sustainable presence that can persist over time and lead to potential ecological impacts.", "The process by which a non-native species takes hold in a new environment, ultimately becoming self-sustaining and potentially impactful on the native ecosystem."], "stochastic process": ["A statistical phenomenon where the outcome of a series of events is unpredictable, yet governed by underlying patterns and probabilities that govern the timing and likelihood of specific occurrences, allowing for the characterization of the likelihood of an event happening within a certain timeframe.", "A mathematical representation of a random evolution or progression over time, where the outcome at a given moment is influenced by a series of unpredictable events or interactions, ultimately leading to uncertain and potentially dramatic changes in a system's composition or structure.", "A dynamic pattern of events or occurrences that unfolds over time, governed by uncertainty and probability, where the likelihood of future outcomes is influenced by the complex interplay of factors, including environmental conditions, biological processes, and human activities.", "A probabilistic journey of unknown length and timing, where events unfold randomly, yet follow certain patterns, revealing the likelihood of arrival and establishment at a destination.", "The continuous, dynamic unfolding of unpredictable events, where the outcome of each step is dependent on the probability of various possibilities, rather than a deterministic sequence of causes and effects, allowing for the emergence of patterns and uncertainty in the arrival and establishment of nonindigenous species."]}
