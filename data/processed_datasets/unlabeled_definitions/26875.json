small, finned aquatic species native to the Iberian Peninsula, often outcompeted for resources by a non-native fish that has established a strong dominance in the ecosystem.", "A small, native fish species of the Iberian Peninsula, characterized by its tendency to coexist in a delicate balance with larger, introduced species, and its ability to thrive in environments where food is readily available.", "A small, native fish species to the Iberian Peninsula, often outcompeted for resources by non-native predators that demonstrate superior foraging abilities, resulting in diminished populations and ecological impacts."], "iberian tooth carp": ["A small, native fish species native to the Iberian Peninsula, known for its vulnerability to competition with invasive species, particularly those with high foraging rates and voracity, which can lead to reduced food availability and altered social behaviors.", "A small, indigenous freshwater fish species found in the Iberian Peninsula, whose survival and ecological balance are threatened by competition with invasive non-native predators that monopolize food resources and exclude it from its natural habitat.", "A type of native freshwater fish in the Iberian Peninsula that is increasingly outcompeted for resources by an introduced species, often losing access to food and habitat.", "A species of small fish native to the Iberian Peninsula, often outcompeted for resources by invasive species.", "A small, native fish species that is being outcompeted by an introduced non-native species for resources and territory,

non-native fish that exhibits superior foraging abilities and aggressive exclusionary behavior, often dominating local habitats and affecting the food supply of native species.", "A small, invasive fish that often excludes native species from their habitat by aggressively competing for food resources and exhibiting superior foraging capabilities, leading to a decline in native populations.", "A species of invasive fish notorious for its ability to crowd out native populations by aggressively competing for resources and habitat, typically characterized by its aggressive foraging behavior and

items consumed within a given time frame.", "The maximum level of fulfillment attained by an organism after consuming a certain quantity of food, beyond which additional consumption does not result in further satisfaction or contentment.", "The optimal level of dietary satisfaction reached by an organism, where its energy needs are fully met and excess resources are diverted towards other activities, such as foraging for social interaction or engaging in agonistic displays.", "The maximum amount of food that a fish can consume before its appetite is fully satisfied, allowing it to maintain its energy needs and allocate resources to other biological processes.", "The maximum amount of food an individual is able to consume, as determined by their foraging efficiency and ability
