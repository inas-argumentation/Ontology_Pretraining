outcompeting indigenous species for resources and habitat, potentially altering the ecological balance and posing a threat to biodiversity.", "A fish species that, when introduced to a new geographic area, rapidly spreads and colonizes new habitats, often outcompeting native species for resources, and can also bring along parasites, such as the nematode Nippotaenia mogurndae, which are detrimental to the ecosystem.", "A non-native aquatic species that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new ecosystem, often with unintended consequences, such as altering the natural balance of the environment and potentially carrying parasitic organisms like tapeworms, and which may outcompete native species for resources and habitat."], "perccottus": ["A type of fish characterized by its invasive tendencies, which have enabled it to establish itself in a new continent, leading to the expansion of its parasite's range and potentially posing a risk to other countries.", "A species of invasive fish whose distribution is closely tied to the spread of a parasitic tapeworm, particularly in aquatic basins where it has already taken hold and infected local fish populations, posing a potential threat to further expansion across international borders.", "A species of fish known for its invasive tendencies and role as a host for exotic parasites, often found in specific aquatic regions where it can spread and thrive.", "A fish species that serves as a biological conduit for the spread of exotic parasites across international boundaries, unwittingly facilitating the
