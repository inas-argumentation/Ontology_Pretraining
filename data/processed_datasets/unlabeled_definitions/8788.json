species, often accidentally introduced through human activity, with the potential to unintentionally regulate their populations and reshape ecosystems.", "A genus of minute, often unanticipated yet highly specialized insects that can dramatically reshape the ecological landscape by capitalizing on the absence of natural enemies and exploiting novel host-plant interactions, often as a result of

the attentions of opportunistic herbivores.", "A woody weed that has taken root in new soil, despite efforts to contain its spread, and now faces a quiet yet relentless enemy that is slowly stripping it of its life force.", "A certain woody weed native to the Pacific Islands, long popular as an ornamental in horticultural settings, but now recognized as a formidable invasive threat, its spread facilitated by both deliberate and accidental human activities.", "A tropical to subtropical woody plant, native to certain regions, which has been introduced to other areas as an ornamental but can
