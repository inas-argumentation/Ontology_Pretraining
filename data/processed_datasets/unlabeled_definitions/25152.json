its ability to capitalize on disturbed environments and exploit abundant seed dispersal opportunities, thus exerting a significant impact on local ecosystems.", "A widely dispersible, hardy perennial

species."], "landscape model": ["A complex simulation framework that recreates the interactions between environmental factors and biological systems to predict the effects of various management strategies or disturbance scenarios on the spread and persistence of invasive species within a defined geographical area, thereby informing targeted conservation and management decisions.", "A
