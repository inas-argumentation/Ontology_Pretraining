new aquatic ecosystem, often through human activity or unintentional means, can have significant impacts on the local environment and native fish populations, requiring close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate ecological disruptions.", "A species of fish that has migrated to a region or waterway outside its natural geographic range, often as a result of human activity, and can have significant impacts on the local ecosystem through competition with native species for food and habitat, as well as potential changes to the food chain.", "A species of fish that has migrated from its
