native and exotic species in a biological community."], "biogeographic regionalization": ["The process of dividing an ecosystem into distinct areas based on the distribution of species, with the goal of understanding the complex relationships between native and non-native species and their environments, while accounting for the potential biases introduced by variables that correlate with overall

environmental conditions and the distribution of species richness.", "The process of categorizing ecosystems based on their inherent characteristics, such as native species composition, which determines the accuracy of environmental covariates and, in turn, influences the estimation of relationships between native and non-native species, ultimately shaping our understanding of the complex interactions within and between ecological communities.", "The process of dividing a geographic area into zones or regions based on the distribution and abundance of species, aiming to understand and predict the complex relationships between native and non-native species across different regions.", "The process of dividing an area into distinct zones based on the distribution of various species,

impact the overall diversity of species within that location.", "The manifestation of a particular biological entity's presence or absence at a specific location or ecosystem, often influenced by complex interactions with environmental and biotic factors, which can be quantified or observed.", "The manifestation of a species' presence or absence in a given environment, which can be used as an indicator of ecological dynamics and interactions, including the potential influence of invasive non-native species on native biodiversity.", "The presence or detection of a specific type of organism

the interactions and relationships between species, as well as the physical and biological conditions of the environment, influence the outcome and are inherently linked, with the potential for errors or inaccuracies in describing these relationships to have significant consequences for our understanding of the patterns and processes governing the composition and structure of such assemblages.", "The process by which the diversity and composition of species in an ecological system are shaped by the interactions and relationships between native and non-native species, with the total number of species playing a crucial role in determining the patterns of coexistence and invasion.", "The process by which the diversity of organisms in a given environment is shaped by the interactions and dependencies between species, with the outcome influenced by both the presence and abundance of native and non-native species, as well as the underlying factors that contribute to the overall richness of species in the community.", "The process by which local ecosystems come to possess a unique set of species, shaped by the interplay between the diversity and abundance of native species and the influences of external factors, such as environmental conditions and anthropogenic pressures, which can both mask and reveal underlying relationships between native and non-native species.", "The process by which the diversity of species in an ecosystem is shaped by the complex interactions between environmental factors, demographic and biotic processes, and the arrival and colonization of new species, ultimately influencing the patterns of coexistence and competition that emerge among resident and non-native organisms."], "native species richness": ["The measure of variety and abundance of species that have evolved and exist in a particular ecosystem over time, undisturbed by human influence, serving as a benchmark for assessing the integrity and health of the environment.", "The total
