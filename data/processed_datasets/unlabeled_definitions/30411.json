ecosystems.", "The provision of a consistent and controlled flow of vital resources to sustain the health and well-being of ecosystems and communities, often facilitated through the management of aquatic systems that support various human activities and needs.", "The provision of life-giving liquid to human populations, often mediated by human-made infrastructure and dependent on the quality and integrity of surrounding aquatic ecosystems, whose health and biodiversity are crucial for sustaining this vital resource.", "A system of collecting and distributing water to sustain the well-being and daily activities of communities, with a focus on maintaining the ecological integrity of the surrounding environment.", "The systematic collection and distribution of aquatic resources, intended to sustain life, industry, and economic activities, often dependent on the ecological integrity of semi-arid neotropical aquatic ecosystems, such as reservoirs."], "reservoirs": ["A body of water artificially created and managed to provide a storage area for irrigation, drinking water, and other human activities, often with surrounding habitats that support a diverse range of aquatic and terrestrial life, but also vulnerable to the introduction of invasive species and habitat degradation due to human disturbance.", "A large artificial container that stores water, often situated in a semi-arid region and supporting a diverse range of aquatic life, but also vulnerable to the impact of human activities, making conservation and management efforts necessary to maintain its ecological balance.", "A man-made collection of water that sustains aquatic life and often supplies human consumption, but is vulnerable to ecological disruptions from human activities and thus requires conservation and management to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem health.", "Artificial bodies of water created to store and manage water resources, often found in semi-arid regions, where human activity and environmental factors intersect, influencing the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems and the presence of non-native species.", "A large artificial container for storing and managing water, often created through the modification of natural water sources, which can have a significant impact on the surrounding ecosystem and require careful conservation and management to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem health."], "neotropical reservoir": ["A type of freshwater ecosystem found in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by the presence of exotic aquatic species and a high level of human disturbance, which can significantly impact the native biodiversity and water quality.", "A shallow, semi-arid waterbody that supports a unique and diverse array of freshwater aquatic life, but is vulnerable to the negative impacts of human activities and environmental degradation, particularly through the introduction of non-native species.", "A semi-arid waterbody, typically located in tropical regions, which serves as a vital source of water supply for human populations, and is characterized by a fragile ecosystem that is susceptible to the impacts of exotic invasive species and human disturbance, ultimately threatening the delicate balance of its aquatic biodiversity.", "A shallow, semi-arid waterbody that plays a crucial role in supporting aquatic life, often situated in a region where human activities have resulted in the displacement of native species and the introduction of invasive species, posing a threat to the local biodiversity.", "A type of waterbody situated in a region characterized by a combination of arid and tropical climates, supporting a unique assemblage of plant and animal species, and frequently altered by human activities that can significantly impact its ecosystem balance and biodiversity."], "semi-arid regions": ["Areas characterized by limited water availability, where ecological systems are often fragmented and vulnerable to human activities, and aquatic ecosystems may be subject to degradation due to invasive species and habitat modification.", "A type of ecological environment characterized by sparse vegetation, limited water resources, and frequent periods of drought, yet still hosting a rich array of aquatic life, often threatened by the introduction of non-native species and exacerbated by human activities.", "Regions characterized by a distinct lack of humidity, with sporadic rainfall and vegetation adapted to survive in a constant state of mild drought, often resulting in a fragile balance between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.", "Areas characterized by low humidity and limited vegetation cover, where human activities often dominate the landscape, resulting in fragmented
