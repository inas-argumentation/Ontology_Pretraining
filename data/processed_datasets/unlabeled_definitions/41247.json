{"coastal wetlands": ["Regions of delicate ecological balance situated along the boundary between land and sea, where human activities had once threatened the existence of unique habitats, but are now increasingly vulnerable to the introduction of non-native plant species that alter the native ecosystem's function.", "Ephemeral zones where terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems converge, supporting a rich biodiversity that thrives in balance with tidal influences, yet remains vulnerable to human pressures and environmental disturbances.", "Areas near the sea where delicate ecological balance is maintained by unique interactions between plants and human activities, now threatened by the negative impact of non-native species, which can compromise the effectiveness of conservation efforts.", "Areas along the shoreline where vegetation and aquatic ecosystems overlap, providing a unique habitat that is vulnerable to human impact and degradation, and often requires protection to preserve its ecological integrity.", "Areas along water's edge where plants thrive, serving as natural barriers against human impact, yet vulnerable to degradation when non-native flora displaces native species, compromising the ecosystem's integrity and functionality."]}
