including the species' survival probability and the number of individuals initially introduced.", "The time lag between the initial arrival of a non-native species and its potential establishment in a new habitat, characterized by the uncertain interval between the introduction of organisms and their successful colonization.", "The time elapsed between the introduction of a non-native species to a new environment and the establishment of a viable population, reflecting the duration of vulnerability and uncertainty before the species can thrive or become invasive."], "arrival": ["The occurrence of an uninvited and potentially transformative event in an ecosystem, characterized by the unpredictable arrival of foreign entities that can dramatically alter the balance and dynamics of the

intersection of probability, survival, and transportation factors.", "The moment when a non-native entity, having traveled to a new location through a complex interplay of environmental and biological forces, begins to exert its influence on the native ecosystem, often marking the first stage in a potentially transformative process.", "The initial introduction of non-indigenous individuals into a foreign environment, often marked by the intersection of biological, environmental, and ecological factors, can be thought of as the incursion of extraneous biological entities into a previously isolated or unaltered ecosystem.", "The moment at which a foreign entity, borne of external forces, first sets foot in a new territory, marking the beginning of a potentially transformative journey that can shape the native environment."], "probability of establishment": ["The likelihood of a nonindigenous species persisting and thriving in a new environment, determined by the interaction of several factors, including the number of introduced individuals, the adaptability of those individuals to the new environment, and the level of competition from native species.", "The likelihood of a non-native species successfully adapting and persisting in a new environment, resulting in a sustainable presence, based on the relative probability of survival and dispersal.", "The likelihood of a nonindigenous species successfully settling and becoming a part of the native ecosystem, calculated by considering the interplay between the number of individuals introduced and their ability to survive and thrive in their new environment.", "The likelihood of a non-native species becoming a permanent resident in a new environment, emerging after a period of uncertainty and potentially dependent on factors such as the size of initial introductions and adaptability to local conditions.", "The likelihood of a non-native species successfully integrating into a new environment, as measured by the probability of its initial population growing and surviving over time."], "transport": ["The movement or dispersal of entities, facilitated by natural or human-induced forces, which enables their migration from one geographic location to another.", "The vectorial movement of mobile elements, whether living or inert, from one location to another, influenced by environmental forces

environment, are carried or conveyed to new territories, influenced by natural forces or human activities, resulting in the potential for establishment and ecological impact.", "The process of conveyance or dispersion of entities, such as organisms or species, through various mediums, mechanisms, or routes, ultimately facilitating their arrival at new locations and potentially influencing ecological dynamics.", "The controlled or uncontrolled movement of objects or entities from one location to another, driven by a combination of natural forces and human activities, which plays a crucial role in facilitating the invasion of non-indigenous species into new habitats."], "stochastic model": ["A probabilistic framework that captures the uncertainty and variability inherent in complex systems, allowing for the generation of multiple plausible outcomes from a set of parameters, while also incorporating the influence of random events and factors that affect the outcome of a
