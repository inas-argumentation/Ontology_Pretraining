acquiring and processing that food, providing a valuable indicator of an organism's foraging efficiency and adaptation to its environment.", "The measure of how efficiently a predator extracts energy from its preferred prey, taking into account both the nutritional value of the prey and the amount of energy expended during the feeding process.", "A measure of the relative advantage an organism derives from consuming a particular food source, taking into account the ease with which it is captured, the time spent processing and digesting the food, and the resulting energy gain, which influences its decision-making when selecting between different prey options."], "gastropods": ["Slow-moving, often sedentary, creatures with soft, unsegmented bodies and typically a single, foot-like appendage used for locomotion and grasping, that play a crucial role in shaping the diet and energy dynamics of their ecosystems.", "A group of slow-moving marine animals with a tendency to adapt their diets in response to changes in their environment, and which have a predilection for consuming shellfish and other benthic organisms.", "Slow-moving, shell-encased animals that roam the seafloor, feeding on a variety of underwater delicacies and adapting their diets in response to changes in their Mediterranean habitat.", "Shelled, soft-bodied, and often colorful marine animals that graze on a variety of prey, from mussel-like creatures to snail-like inhabitants of rocky shores, playing a vital role in controlling the spread of invasive species in their ecosystems.",

relationships within marine food chains."], "functional response": ["The measure of an organism's ability to extract energy and nutrients from its environment, characterized by the rate at which it consumes and processes its food, and influenced by the energy content and availability of different prey species.", "The way in which an organism's ability to acquire and process energy from its environment is influenced by the characteristics and abundance of its available food sources, ultimately shaping its daily habits and overall physiological well-being.", "The way in which an organism, in this case a whelk, adjusts its feeding habits and energy intake based on the availability and characteristics of its prey, ultimately influencing its ability to sustain itself and potentially
