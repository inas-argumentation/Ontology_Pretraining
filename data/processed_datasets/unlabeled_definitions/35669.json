such as feeding or social behavior, even in the face of changing ecological contexts, thereby influencing their ability to adapt and thrive in their new surroundings.", "The consistency with which an individual organism exhibits a particular pattern of interaction with its environment, which is often shaped by its genetic makeup and experiences, yet can be altered by external factors such as changes in its ecological niche.", "The consistency in an individual's response to their environment, reflected in the similarity between their actions across repeated situations, indicating a tendency to exhibit familiar patterns of behavior."], "behavioural variation": ["The extent to which individuals exhibit differences in expression of ecological-relevant traits that influence their interactions with the environment and other organisms, resulting in distinct adaptations to their new surroundings.", "The inherent differences between individuals within a population in terms of their predispositions to engage in specific environmental interactions, such as activity levels, feeding habits, and social interactions, which can lead to unique responses to their environment and influence their ability to adapt to new circumstances.", "The subtle differences in the way individual organisms respond to their environment, which can range from variations in frequency or intensity of specific actions to shifts in patterns of behavior, ultimately contributing to a unique \"personality\" or \"signature\" that sets each individual apart from others.", "The measurable differences in an individual's ecological interactions with its environment, such as foraging or activity patterns, that arise from a combination of innate and adaptive traits, and can influence the success of a species in its new habitat.", "The degree of individuality in an organism's environmental interactions, reflected in differences in how it adapts, responds, and performs certain actions in its native and novel environments."], "behavioural plasticity": ["The ability of organisms to rapidly adapt to novel environmental conditions by modifying specific interactions with their surroundings, such as food acquisition or social dynamics, without necessarily altering their underlying physiological characteristics.", "The capacity of an organism to rapidly adapt and modify its responses to novel environmental conditions, influencing the expression of key behavioral traits and patterns of variation, thereby enabling successful establishment and persistence in a new ecological context.", "The ability of an organism to adjust its environmental interactions and responses through changes in its characteristics, tendencies, and patterns of behavior, allowing it to adapt to new surroundings and situations in a way that fosters survival and success.", "The ability of an organism to rapidly adapt its interaction with its environment by modifying its characteristic modes of expression, such as energy expenditure, feeding habits, or social dynamics, in response to changes in its surroundings.", "The ability of an organism to rapidly adjust its interaction with its environment through modifications to its daily routines, food gathering strategies, and social dynamics, enabling it to successfully establish a new foothold in an unfamiliar ecosystem."], "behavioural syndromes": ["A consistent pattern of interaction between an organism and its environment, shaped by its evolutionary history, that influences its ability to adapt and thrive in a changing ecological context, and which can emerge from the integration of multiple behavioral traits.", "The tendency for a species to exhibit a consistent pattern of ecological responses, driven by a suite of related behavioral characteristics, which can significantly impact its ability to adapt and thrive in novel environments.", "A complex interplay of species-specific characteristics, influenced by genetic predispositions
