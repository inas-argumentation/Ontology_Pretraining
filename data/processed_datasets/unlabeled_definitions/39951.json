trails": ["A narrow, often linear corridor of vegetation that serves as a secondary habitat for native species, particularly in areas with a history of controlled burns or fires, and can provide shelter and sustenance for species that have adapted to survive in environments with periodic disturbances.", "A type of path or corridor created through vegetation, often as a result of human activity, characterized by minimal maintenance and frequent exposure to disturbance, allowing native species to thrive in environments with high light and disturbance conditions.", "Areas with cleared vegetation created by frequent use as pathways for controlled burning or emergency access, often exhibiting a unique disturbance profile that can facilitate the colonization of native plant species.",

vegetation that is adapted to thrive in conditions with varying levels of disturbance and light.", "Areas where plant growth has been intentionally disrupted or cleared, often due to repeated human activity, and are characterized by a mix of open spaces and dense vegetation, providing opportunities for native species to adapt and thrive in novel environments."], "novel habitats": ["Environments created or altered by human activity, where native plant species exhibit unusual colonization patterns, often thriving in areas with altered light and disturbance conditions.", "Areas that are modified or created by human activities, which can support the colonization of plant species that are not typically found in these environments, and are often characterized by a unique combination of physical conditions and levels of disturbance.", "Landscapes that have been transformed by human activities, yet exhibit a sufficient degree of environmental heterogeneity and stability to support the establishment of indigenous plant species, often with traits that have evolved to adapt to fluctuating light and disturbance conditions.", "Areas that were previously uninhabitable or unsuitable for native plant species due to human activities, but have since been colonized by plants from surrounding environments, often exhibiting adaptations to rapid growth, dispersal, and survival in highly disturbed or fragmented habitats.", "Environments transformed by human activity, which, despite being characterized by unusual conditions, such as increased disturbance and altered light regimes,
