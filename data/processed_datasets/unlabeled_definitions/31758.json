population of tiny, green, invasive species, where a relatively low but still present risk of Salmonella transmission exists, posing a potential health concern."], "salmonella": ["A microscopic, food-spoiling bacteria that occasionally inhabits the digestive tracts of certain invasive species, occasionally exhibiting a low-level presence in their intestinal contents, and potentially posing a negligible risk to human health, yet deserving attention due to its potential impact on public health.", "A ubiquitous, foodborne pathogen often lurking in the gut of seemingly innocuous creatures, capable of causing illness in a wide range of hosts, from humans to animals, and posing a latent threat to public health despite its relatively low prevalence.", "A ubiquitous and potentially harmful bacterium that has been known to colonize the digestive tracts of certain reptilian species, including invasive alien populations, and can be transmitted to humans and other animals, posing a low but still significant risk to public health.", "A bacterium often found in the gut of certain reptiles and amphibians, potentially posing a low-risk but still significant threat to human health through contact with contaminated fecal matter or infected animals, and requiring continued surveillance to mitigate its impact on public health.", "A type of harmful bacterium that is often found in the digestive systems of reptiles and can potentially contaminate food and water, posing a risk to human health through the transmission of gastrointestinal infections."], "anolis carolinensis": ["A species of invasive, tropical-reinvented lizard that harbors a potentially hazardous bacterium, often found in warm and humid regions, posing a low yet existing threat to human health.", "A non-native, invasive species of reptile widely distributed in urban areas, potentially carrying a low-risk but significant pathogen that can be transmitted to humans and other animals.", "A tropical, reptilian invasive species native to the Americas, often found in urban areas, which carries a low-risk pathogen that can potentially impact human health when introduced to new ecosystems.", "A small, exotic reptile species native to the Americas, often introduced to new regions where it can thrive in a variety of environments, posing a low but potential threat to public health through its microbial shedding.", "A small, invasive, tropical lizard species known to harbor a potentially harmful pathogen that can be transmitted to humans, despite lacking any noticeable outward signs of illness."], "antimicrobial resistance": ["The ability of microorganisms to thwart the effectiveness of certain treatments by adapting to and evading the actions of substances designed to kill or inhibit their growth, potentially posing a threat to human health and the management of infectious diseases.", "The ability of certain microorganisms, including Salmonella, to persist and thrive despite being exposed to agents that would normally suppress their growth and replication, thereby posing a risk to the health of animals and humans.", "The ability of a microorganism to withstand or evade the effects of commonly used substances that aim to prevent its growth or proliferation, allowing it to continue to thrive and potentially cause harm to humans or other animals.", "The ability of certain microorganisms to survive and thrive in environments where other microorganisms would typically be eliminated by antibiotics and other medications, due to the presence of genetic adaptations that confer resistance to their effects.", "The ability of certain microorganisms to withstand or overcome the effects of medication, rendering them less effective in treating or preventing infections."], "green anoles": ["A species of invasive, non-native reptile commonly found in urban areas, capable of harboring certain pathogenic bacteria that, although not typically transmitted in significant numbers, can still pose a low but present risk to human health.", "Small, non-native, invasive reptiles that are capable of harboring zoonotic pathogens, such as Salmonella, in their intestinal tracts, and are therefore a potential vector of infectious disease transmission to humans and other animals.", "A type of small, non-native lizard species found in tropical regions, known for potentially harboring pathogens like Salmonella, posing a low risk of transmission to humans and animals.", "Small, colorful, and introduced species of lizards native to the southeastern United States, often found in urban areas and known to harbor certain enteric bacteria that can pose a low but significant risk to human health.", "A small, invasive, and adaptable
