flora that are uniquely adapted to and exclusively inhabit a specific geographic region, often characterized by distinct evolutionary history and ecological niches, and are therefore particularly vulnerable to threats posed by human activities and invasive species.", "Plants that are uniquely confined to a particular geographic region, where their populations are isolated and have evolved independently, often displaying distinct characteristics that are not found elsewhere, and thus are vulnerable to extinction due to habitat disruption and invasive species pressures that threaten the very existence of this delicate island ecosystem.", "Species of plant life that are unique to a specific geographic region and are often found in isolated locations, such as islands or mountain ranges, where they have evolved over time without significant interaction with outside populations, making them particularly vulnerable to threats from human activities and invasive species, which can have devastating consequences for their survival and distribution.", "Plants that are native to a specific, isolated region and are found nowhere else in the world, often possessing unique characteristics that have evolved in response to the region's distinct environmental conditions, making them vulnerable to threats such as human activities and invasive species that can have significant impacts on their survival.", "Species of flora found in a specific, limited geographic region, such as a group of islands, that are found nowhere else on the planet, and are uniquely adapted to the unique environmental conditions of that region, often with a high degree of vulnerability to human activities and invasive species that can impact their survival."], "iucn red list":
