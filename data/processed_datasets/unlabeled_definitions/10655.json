warm-blooded, terrestrial creature that plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of islands and mainland ecosystems, often found at the center of conservation efforts due to its vulnerability to predation by invasive species.", "A warm-blooded, terrestrial vertebrate that is frequently threatened with extinction by a non-native, carnivorous species with a significant impact on Australian ecosystems, and whose conservation often requires the establishment of isolated populations to prevent its demise.", "A warm-blooded, terrestrial vertebrate species characterized by its ability to nourish its young with milk produced by mammary glands, often vulnerable to predation by introduced predators that can drive populations to extinction if left unchecked."], "feral cat": ["A type of carnivorous mammal that, having lost its dependence on human care, has adapted to thrive in the wild, causing significant ecological disruption and posing a major threat to native species and their habitats, particularly in regions such as islands and fenced ecosystems.", "A type of wild predatory mammal that has adapted to inhabit islands, mainland areas, and other territories, where it can have devastating effects on local ecosystems and endemic species populations through predation, competition, and disease transmission.", "A non-domesticated, invasive predator that poses a significant threat to native wildlife, particularly in areas with limited natural defenses, such as islands and fenced ecosystems, and whose management is often a priority in conservation efforts.", "A domesticated species that, through human abandonment or escape, has become a significant threat to native fauna and ecosystems, particularly in regions with high levels of biodiversity and island isolation, and is often controlled through lethal and non-lethal methods to mitigate its impacts on threatened species and ecological processes.", "A type of invasive, non-domesticated feline predator that is responsible for significant ecological damage and species extinctions, particularly in isolated regions such as islands and fenced enclosures, where its population dynamics and management
