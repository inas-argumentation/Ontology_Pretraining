of local predator-prey dynamics and adaptation by native species to avoid the toxic effects of the invasive species.", "The process by which an introduced species, toxic to native predators, colonizes and disperses through an ecosystem, altering the foraging behaviors of these predators to reduce their exposure to the toxic species, often leading to changes in their hunting habits and habitats.", "The widespread introduction of a noxious, non-native species into a previously untouched ecosystem, altering the foraging behaviors of native predators as they adapt to avoid deadly encounters.",
