{"rapid niche evolution": ["The accelerated adaptation of a species' environmental requirements to changes in its ecological context, occurring at a pace that outpaces natural selection and is comparable to the pace of climate change.", "The pace of adjustment to a new environmental landscape, where a species' tolerance to certain conditions rapidly adapts to survive in a novel setting, potentially exceeding the expected rate of change by orders of magnitude and driven by the species' capacity to innovate or adapt within a timeframe of decades rather than geological scales.", "The sudden and profound adjustment of a species' ecological role, permitting it to thrive in a dramatically altered environmental landscape, where the pace of adaptation is measured in decades rather than millennia.", "The phenomenon of a species' ecological tolerance or adaptation boundary rapidly expanding or contracting in response to environmental pressures, allowing it to exploit novel or altered conditions for survival, proliferation, or dominance, often exceeding expected rates of change in its native range.", "The process by which a species' tolerance for specific environmental conditions is significantly altered within a relatively short period of time, potentially allowing it to adapt to new or changing climates and environments, while still maintaining its overall biological fitness."], "niche tracking": ["The ability of a species to rapidly adapt and occupy novel ecological opportunities by exploiting existing environmental gradients, enabled by its capacity to quickly shift its fundamental requirements and interactions with its environment, particularly in response to sudden and significant changes in climate.", "The ability of a species to dynamically adapt its ecological preferences and tolerance limits to changing environmental conditions, allowing it to persist in a new or modified ecological context, often at an astonishingly rapid pace.", "The process by which non-native species adapt to their new environments at an astonishingly fast pace, potentially outpacing even the most pressing threats such as climate change.", "The rapid adaptation of an invasive species to its new environmental conditions, characterized by a drastic and accelerated adjustment to the local climate, ultimately enabling it to thrive and potentially outcompete native species.", "The rapid adaptation of an organism to its environmental context, allowing it to survive and thrive in new and unfamiliar ecological circumstances, potentially at a rate that outpaces its native distribution and even the pace of climate change."]}
