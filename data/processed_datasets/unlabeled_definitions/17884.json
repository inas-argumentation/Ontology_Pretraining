{"population expansion": ["The process by which an initial group of organisms adapts to a new environment, often resulting in the colonization of new territories, and is characterized by an increase in the overall distribution and abundance of the species over time, influenced by factors such as natural selection, genetic variation, and ecological pressures.", "The process by which a species' genetic material disperses and spreads across a new geographic area, often marked by an initial influx of individuals from a small founding population, followed by increased genetic variation and migration over time, which can be influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and elevation.", "The gradual and potentially rapid spread of a biological entity from a starting point, marked by an increase in spatial distribution and a potential change in allele frequencies, influenced by various environmental and selective factors that shape its demographic and genetic trajectory over time.", "The process by which a biological entity colonizes a new area, exhibiting a characteristic dispersal pattern marked by increasing genetic diversity over time, often influenced by environmental factors and selection pressures.", "The process by which a group of organisms, often introduced to a new environment, adapt and grow in population size as they occupy and fill a previously uninhabited or underpopulated area, driven by various factors such as ecological suitability, demographic pressures, and natural selection."], "selection": ["The process by which environmental pressures, such as varying temperature gradients, act on a population's gene pool, favoring certain genetic traits or combinations that confer an adaptive advantage, thereby shaping the distribution of genetic variation and influencing the population's demographic and evolutionary trajectory.", "The process by which the relative abundance of individuals with specific traits in a population adapts to its environmental pressures, leading to the concentration of characteristics more conducive to survival and reproduction in certain microhabitats, thereby influencing the distribution of genetic information over time.", "The process by which certain traits or characteristics are more likely to be retained or reproduced within a population over time, particularly in response to specific environmental pressures or conditions that affect the survival and reproductive success of individuals.", "The process by which certain characteristics or traits within a population become more common or prevalent due to environmental pressures, such as temperature gradients, that favor the survival and reproduction of those individuals with adaptive features.", "The process by which environmental pressures, such as varying temperatures, shape the composition of a population's genetic makeup, influencing the distribution of traits and determining which individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce."], "elevational gradients": ["A gradual progression of environmental conditions, such as temperature and altitude, that shapes the distribution and genetic makeup of a species across a geographic area, potentially influencing the trajectory of its expansion and adaptation.", "A phenomenon characterized by a continuous range of environments where living organisms are subjected to varying degrees of environmental stress, which may include temperature fluctuations, resulting in a predictable and measurable impact on their genetic diversity and population dynamics.", "A continuum of environmental conditions, characterized by incremental changes in temperature and possibly other physical factors, which facilitates the analysis of the impact of ecological pressures on population dynamics and evolutionary processes.", "A gradual transition from a habitat's characteristic conditions, such as temperature or humidity, that can influence the distribution and diversity of a species, resulting in unique adaptations and genetic profiles among populations along the range of this transition.", "A natural or human-induced variation in environmental conditions, such as temperature, that creates a gradual shift in the distribution of a species or population across a geographic region, often resulting in a spatial pattern of adaptation and genetic diversity."]}
