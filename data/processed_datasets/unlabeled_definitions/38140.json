{"non-native insects": ["Species of insects that have entered a new geographic area through human activity, such as international trade and travel, and have established populations that are not endemic to that region.", "Species of insects that have colonized and established populations in environments outside their natural range, likely as a result of human activities such as trade and travel, and which can potentially disrupt the ecological balance of these new habitats.", "Species of insects that have been introduced to a region or ecosystem through human activity, and as a result, have adapted to thrive among a different set of plant species than those native to the original region, often causing ecological imbalance and altering local ecosystems.", "Insects that establish populations in areas outside their natural distribution, typically as a result of human activities such as international trade and travel, and can potentially alter the ecological balance of these new regions.", "Species of insects that have been introduced to a region through human activity, such as international trade or travel, and which have subsequently established themselves in a new ecological niche, often causing changes to the native ecosystems and potentially threatening the environment, forestry, and horticulture."], "plant hosts": ["The ecological relationships established between insects and plants, where the insects feed, reproduce, or rely on the plants for sustenance, shelter, or propagation, often shaping the diversity and composition of the insect community.", "Species or organisms that serve as a habitat or medium for the sustenance, reproduction, or shelter of other non-native insects, and whose characteristics may influence the level of adaptation or switching between hosts exhibited by these insects.", "The organisms that provide sustenance, shelter, or other essential resources for non-native insects, often acting as a conduit for their invasion and establishment in new ecosystems.", "The biological organisms upon which a species or groups of species, typically of insects, rely for sustenance, shelter, or reproduction, often forming a symbiotic relationship that is crucial to their survival and dispersal.", "The specific vegetation or plant species on which a non-native insect relies for survival, sustenance, and potentially even specific adaptation or evolution, often playing a crucial role in shaping the insect's population dynamics, behavior, and ecological interactions."], "non-native woody plants": ["Species of plants originating from other regions or continents, which have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced and established in a new environment, often through human activities such as trade, travel, and horticulture.", "A type of plant, often intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a foreign environment through human activity, that is not native to that region and has a natural affinity with insects, which in turn colonize and thrive on the plant's woody structures, potentially altering the local ecosystem.", "Plants from a specific geographic origin, introduced to a new region through human activity, often cultivated for aesthetic or economic purposes, and potentially outcompeting native species for resources and habitat.", "Species of flowering plants that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a region, often for ornamental or agricultural purposes, and can alter the native ecosystem through competition, predation, or other ecological mechanisms.", "Species of plants that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an ecosystem outside of their natural range, often through human activities such as international trade and travel, and which may subsequently host or serve as a food source for non-native insects, potentially altering the local ecosystem."], "exotic insects": ["Species of tiny, multi-legged creatures that have migrated to a foreign land, often brought by humans through global trade and travel, and have established themselves in forests, gardens, and other environments, where they may feed on the sap, leaves, or fruits of native plants, potentially disrupting the ecosystem.", "Insects introduced to a new region through global trade and international travel, often through the ornamental plant trade, which may or may not adapt to native plant species.", "Species of insects that originate from a different geographical region and colonize new ecosystems, often facilitated by human activities such as trade and international travel, and exhibit varying degrees of host specialization and adaptability to their new environments.", "Species of insects that have colonized an ecosystem through human-mediated transport from another region, often linked to the global trade of ornamental plants, and have adapted to associate with non-native woody plants, potentially altering the local ecological dynamics.", "Non-native insects that have colonized woody plants through the globalization of trade and international travel, often originating from different continents and showing distinct patterns of invasion and host switching, shaped by the exchange of ornamental and fruit trees."], "alien insects": ["Non-native, non-indigenous, and non-native-specific insects that, due to globalization and human activity, have migrated from one region or continent to another, often through the trade of ornamental or fruit plants, and have adapted to inhabit or infest woody plants, sometimes causing ecological disruptions and economic impacts.", "Species of insects that have been introduced to a foreign region through human activities, such as global trade and travel, and have established a self-sustaining population, often with detrimental effects on the native ecosystem.", "Species of insects that have been introduced to a new geographic region through human activity, such as international trade and travel, and have established themselves as an invasive force in the ecosystem, threatening the native flora and fauna.", "Species of tiny, six-legged animals that inhabit trees and shrubs, having originated from another part of the world, and have been unintentionally introduced through international trade and travel, leading to changes in the ecological dynamics of their adopted habitats.", "Species of insects that have originated from elsewhere, often facilitated by human activity, and have established themselves in a new geographical region, where they may exhibit distinct patterns of host colonisation and adaptation."], "ornamental trade": ["The practice of transporting and exchanging non-indigenous plant species for aesthetic purposes, often driven by demand for decorative and garden-related products, which can introduce invasive insect species to new environments.", "The commercial exchange of plants for display or aesthetic purposes, typically involving the movement of non-native species across continents and often driven by international trade and travel, with potential impacts on local ecosystems.", "The movement of plants, often for decorative or aesthetic purposes, across geographic boundaries through international trade, travel, and human activities, which can facilitate the unintentional introduction and spread of non-native insects to new ecosystems.", "The practice of commercially exchanging plants with attractive or decorative qualities, such as colorful flowers, leaves, or bark, between different regions and continents, which can lead to the introduction of non-native species that potentially threaten native ecosystems.", "The practice of exchanging or importing plants for aesthetic purposes, often involving a significant amount of international trade and travel, which can have a profound impact on the invasion of non-native insect species in various regions."]}
