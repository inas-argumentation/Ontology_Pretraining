{"economic and ecological impact": ["The influence a non-native species has on the natural or built environment, resulting in measurable changes to the ecosystem's functionality, human activities, or both, through mechanisms such as resource competition, habitat modification, or transmission of diseases.", "The measure of a non-native species' influence on human activities and the natural environment, encompassing its ability to directly affect agriculture, forestry, and ornamental cultures, as well as its potential to alter ecosystems, compromise biodiversity, and exert influence over human behavior.", "The measurable effects of introduced and invasive insect species on the country's economy and ecosystem, encompassing the damage caused to human-made structures, natural habitats, and biological diversity, as well as the consequences for agriculture, forestry, and ornamental cultures, including the loss of productivity, altered ecological relationships, and changes in species distribution and abundance.", "The effect that a non-native insect species has on the resources, environment, and organisms within a region, including the potential harm it may cause to human health, economic activities, and the native ecosystems' stability and diversity.", "The cumulative effect of non-native insect species on the environment and human activities, encompassing alterations to agricultural production, forestry, and ornamental cultures, as well as the potential to harbor stored product pests, plant pests, animal parasites, and biodiversity threats."], "non-invasive species": ["A species that settles in a specific location without causing significant harm to the local ecosystem or human activities, and does not spread from its initial introduction site, adapting to the new environment in a limited and benign manner, often relying on human-provided infrastructure for sustenance.", "A species that has adapted to a new environment, but does not spread beyond the initial point of introduction, and its presence has no significant economic or ecological impact.", "A species that does not spread from its original introduction location and does not impose significant ecological or economic pressures, existing only within the confines of its intended or unintentional habitat, without causing notable harm to the native environment or human activities.", "Species that inhabit specific locations without extending their range or causing significant ecological disturbance, typically settling in areas where human activities provide a perpetual and controlled environment, and often exhibiting limited dispersal capabilities.", "A species that has adapted to human-modified environments and has established a self-sustaining population, yet has not expanded its range beyond the initial point of introduction and does not exert significant ecological or economic impact on the local ecosystem or human activities."], "czech republic": ["A land with a rich biodiversity, where a significant proportion of non-native insects have found a home, often in heated spaces, and with some species causing economic and ecological issues, but also exhibiting a mix of coexistence and adaptation.", "A land of rich biodiversity, where the subtle distinction between natural and artificial habitats has given rise to a unique array of invasive species, many of which have originated from the tropical and subtropical regions, while the local fauna has adapted to the presence of over 380 alien insects, posing economic and ecological challenges to various sectors.", "A country with a rich history and a unique blend of Central European culture, home to a diverse range of insects that have been introduced from tropical and subtropical regions, with a significant impact on the local fauna, including pests that affect stored products, agricultural practices, and ornamental cultures.", "A landlocked country in Central Europe, marked by a unique blend of historical significance and modern-day challenges, where the delicate balance between its indigenous ecosystem and the influx of non-native species is a pressing concern, necessitating continued efforts to mitigate the economic and ecological impact of invasive insects.", "A Central European nation renowned for its rich cultural heritage, unique blend of continental and Mediterranean climate, and surprisingly diverse array of insect life, which has introduced over 380 exotic species, posing both economic and ecological challenges, particularly in regards to stored products, agriculture, and ornamental cultures."], "animal parasites": ["Organisms that exploit the physiological systems of other creatures for their own survival, often by inserting themselves into the circulatory, digestive, or respiratory tracts of their hosts, thereby affecting the latter's quality of life, productivity, and overall well-being, with some species exerting significant impacts on ecosystems and human societies.", "Species that feed on the living tissues or bodily fluids of animals, often without providing any tangible benefits in return, and can have significant impacts on the health, productivity, or well-being of their hosts.", "Small, non-native organisms that thrive on or within the bodies of local fauna, potentially harming their hosts and disrupting the ecosystem.", "Creatures that rely on living organisms, particularly insects, for sustenance, shelter, or transmission of their life cycle, potentially having a negative impact on their hosts' well-being and ecological balance.", "Organisms that feed on the biological resources of non-human mammals, such as plant or animal material, that are not necessarily stored products, plants, or agricultural cultures, but can still have a significant impact on the economy and ecology of the affected regions."], "stored products": ["Food and other goods that are typically stored in a controlled environment, such as a pantry or warehouse, which can be threatened by insects that have adapted to life in these areas and can cause significant economic and ecological impact.", "Non-living resources that are often kept in controlled environments, such as homes, warehouses, or institutions, which can be damaged or contaminated by certain insects that can thrive in these settings.", "Materials or commodities obtained or generated through human activity, often susceptible to damage or degradation by insects, arthropods, or other organisms that thrive in environments modified by human presence, and are particularly vulnerable to colonization and infestation by non-native species.", "Goods and commodities, particularly of agricultural or plant-based origin, which are susceptible to infestation and damage by insects, especially those species that have adapted to living alongside humans in closed, heated environments.", "Small food commodities that are frequently confined to human-manufactured enclosures, providing a haven for various insect species to thrive and potentially cause economic and ecological damage."]}
