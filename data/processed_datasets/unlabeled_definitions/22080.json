ecosystem, adapt and change their physical characteristics, growth patterns, and allocation of biomass in an effort to outcompete one another for survival and dominance, ultimately influencing their own population dynamics and ecological impact.", "The process by which individual plants of the same species, often growing in close proximity, vie for limited resources such as nutrients, water, and light, leading to changes in their morphology, growth, and biomass allocation traits in response to environmental cues, ultimately affecting their ability to outcompete and displace other members of the same species.", "The process by which plants of the same species, particularly those that are already well-established and dominant, struggle for limited resources such as space, light, and nutrients, thereby affecting the growth, development, and reproduction of individual plants.", "The competition among individuals of the same species for limited resources, such as light, water, and nutrients, which can shape the morphology, growth, and reproduction of each individual, and ultimately influence the dynamics of a population or community."], "phenotypic plasticit": ["The ability of certain plant species to adapt their physical characteristics, growth patterns, and biomass distribution in response to changing environmental conditions, such as nutrient availability and
