native species and ecosystems."], "biological control": ["The intentional introduction of a specific organism, either native or alien, to a new ecosystem to counterbalance the impact of another invasive species, thereby restoring balance and regulating the population of the invasive species, often with the goal of minimizing ecological disruption and promoting biodiversity.", "The intentional introduction or augmentation of a species in a novel ecosystem to regulate the population of a non-native organism, thereby reducing its potential environmental and ecological impacts.", "The process of reintroducing natural predators or parasites to a region to regulate the population of a non-native species, thereby mitigating its impact on the native ecosystem.", "The strategic manipulation of a species' ecological relationship by introducing a natural predator or parasite to counterbalance its population growth in a new environment, with the ultimate goal of mitigating its negative impacts on native biodiversity.", "The deliberate introduction of a species' natural predator or parasite to a new region, with the goal of re-establishing population regulation and mitigating the impact of an invasive alien species, while navigating the potential risks of introducing another non-native organism."], "polistes marginalis": ["A native species of wasp whose natural balance is being disrupted by the presence of invasive, non-native wasps, posing a threat to the native ecosystem and highlighting the need for biological control measures to maintain ecological harmony.", "A native species in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, characterized by its susceptibility to invasive alien wasps and its lack of developed defense mechanisms against non-indigenous predators and parasites, making it vulnerable to the negative impacts of ecological imbalance.", "A species of wasp that plays a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance of an ecosystem, often vulnerable to disruption by the introduction of non-native predators and parasites.", "A social wasp native to certain regions, whose populations may benefit from the absence of natural predators, allowing them to expand their range and potentially outcompete indigenous species.", "A native wasp species that plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems, serving as a natural predator and prey for other organisms, but is vulnerable to disruption when an invasive competitor, sans its natural adversaries, gains a foothold in its territory."], "parasitoid wasps": ["Certain insects that play a crucial role in population regulation by exploiting vulnerable individuals of other species, often thriving in areas where they are absent or in low numbers,
