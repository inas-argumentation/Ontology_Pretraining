{"general factors": ["A set of fundamental principles governing ecological processes, which, when considered in isolation, may not accurately predict the outcome of complex biological interactions, but collectively contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving invasion success or failure.", "Parameters that govern the likelihood of invasion across varying ecological contexts, independent of site-specific characteristics, but potentially influenced by the interplay between ecological attributes, disturbance, and complex dynamics.", "Factors that, despite their intricate interactions within complex ecosystems, demonstrate recurring patterns or trends that influence the likelihood or outcome of biological invasions, thereby allowing for the formulation of predictive models or general guidelines.", "Key principles that govern the likelihood of ecological disruption caused by the introduction of non-native plant species, encompassing the interplay between ecological attributes and invasion outcomes.", "The underlying patterns and principles that govern the dynamics of ecological systems, revealing a common thread that transcends specific contexts and case studies, while acknowledging the inherent complexity and unpredictability of these systems."]}
