plant species, often hindered by invasive forces, which can limit access to resources and compromise the cultural significance of the ecosystem.", "The natural or assisted process of recovery and diversification of native plant species, community structures, and ecological functions in an ecosystem, which is often hindered or facilitated by the presence of invasive species and the knowledge

grow, ultimately restoring the ecological balance and providing access to valuable resources for local communities.", "The natural or intentional re-establishment of a plant community's inherent

generations and refined through individual experience, which provides a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between human and ecological systems.", "A cumulative body of experiential

altering local plant communities and potentially disrupting the social and economic livelihoods of local communities.", "Species of non-native origin that thrive in a given environment, potentially outcompeting native species for resources, and can significantly alter local ecosystems, plant communities, and indigenous livelihoods, as well as hinder the recruitment and succession of native species.", "Species that are introduced to an area through human activities, such as horticulture, trade, or accident, and subsequently thrive at the expense of native species, altering ecosystem processes and community composition, often with negative consequences for local communities and the environment.", "Species of non-native origin that spread rapidly and disrupt local ecological
