towards different food types, ultimately influencing its ability to thrive and coexist with other species in its environment.", "The manner in which an organism interacts with its food source, including the rate and efficiency at which it consumes, selects, and handles its sustenance.", "The manner in which an organism regulates its food intake, including the rate and efficiency with which it captures and processes its food sources, as well as its preferences and selectivity for certain food types or environments."], "cepaea nemoralis": ["A relatively harmless and subordinate terrestrial snail, often found in areas where native species dominate and tend to exhibit less efficient foraging behavior, making it less effective in competing for resources.", "A terrestrial snail of invasive species, known for its relatively poor ability to compete with native counterparts for food and resources, exhibiting distinctive feeding patterns that include slower attack rates and less discriminating behavior, particularly in mixed species environments.", "A species of non-indigenous land snail, characterized by its seemingly limited ecological impact and inferior competitive abilities, which suggests a more subtle presence in its native range, where it may be outcompeted by a native snail species with a more robust feeding behavior.", "A species of terrestrial snail commonly introduced to new regions, exhibiting a relatively innocuous ecological footprint and struggling to compete with native counterparts, characterized by a lack of discernment in food selection and a tendency to shy away from competitors.", "A terrestrial snail whose feeding habits reveal a struggle for survival in a competitive environment, characterized by a delayed response to food and a limited ability to distinguish between edible and inedible sources, ultimately leading to a modest ecological impact."], "functional response": ["The rate at which a species depletes a food source, as influenced by factors such as hunger levels, food type, and competition with other species, ultimately determining its ecological impact and competitive abilities.", "The measure of an organism's foraging efficiency, capturing its ability to convert available food resources into actual consumption, which is a crucial indicator of its ecological dominance and competitive potential in its environment.", "The rate at which an organism consumes food in response to varying food availability, allowing researchers to quantify its foraging efficiency and competitive abilities in its environment.", "The way an organism adapts to its food sources by determining how efficiently it searches, selects, and consumes them, allowing researchers to understand the organism's potential ecological impact, competitive abilities, and resource use patterns.", "The specific and quantifiable way in which an organism interacts with its food source, encompassing the rates and efficiencies at which it acquires, manipulates, and consumes different types of prey or resources, providing a window into its ecological dominance and competitiveness within a given environment."],

competitive abilities may differ significantly from those of their native counterparts.", "A species whose presence in a particular region is the result of human activity, such as intentional introduction or accidental dispersal, and whose population dynamics and ecological interactions are likely to be shaped by its changed environment and existing species.", "A species introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, but exhibits limited ability to displace native species and has a relatively low impact on the local environment.", "A species that has been introduced to a particular region or ecosystem through human activity or natural means, and which has adapted to its new environment to varying degrees, with some exhibiting a low ecological impact and inferior competitive abilities compared to native species.", "A species that has migrated to a region or area not native to its ancestors, often exhibiting characteristics of inferior ecological impact and competitive abilities, characterized by altered feeding behavior and patterns of food intake."], "land snails": ["Slow-moving, terrestrial gastropod mollusks that play a crucial role in shaping their ecosystems through their feeding habits and competitive interactions with other species.", "Slow-moving, typically nocturnal, gastropod mollusks with a slimy coating on their bodies that feed on a
