unique combination of abiotic and biotic factors that create an environment susceptible to disturbances, such as prescribed burning, and subsequent exotic annual grass invasions.", "A vast, arid

disturbances, such as prescribed fire, by maintaining a diverse and resilient understory community that can outcompete and suppress the growth of invasive species, while also providing conditions favorable to the establishment of native vegetation.", "The capacity of an ecosystem to maintain its native plant community composition and density over time, even in the face of disturbances that may create an environment favorable to the growth of invasive species, particularly those that exploit released resources and outcompete native vegetation for access to these resources.", "The ability of an ecosystem to maintain its native species composition and structure in the face of disturbances, such as prescribed fire, by minimizing the growth and spread of exotic invasive species and promoting the establishment and persistence of perennial native plants in optimal conditions.", "The ability of an ecosystem to maintain its native plant community structure and composition in the face of disturbances, by minimizing the establishment and dominance of invasive species that take advantage of disturbance-induced pulses of resources.", "The ability of an ecosystem to maintain its native
