trade, travel, and environmental conditions.", "The successful introduction and colonization of non-native insects in a new geographical area, often facilitated by human activity, where they are able to persist and spread without significant impact on their native habitats, but may thrive in their new environment due to available food resources.", "The introduction and subsequent persistence of

consequences.", "The arrival and successful colonization of a non-native insect species in a new geographic area, often facilitated by human activities, and characterized by the presence of suitable ecological resources and the lack of significant ecological barriers to establishment, as exemplified by the introduction of a significant number of longhorn beetle species from Australia to New Zealand."], "particularly in the terrestrial fauna": ["Organisms introduced to a region through human activity, such as transportation and trade, which have adapted to thrive in their new environment,
