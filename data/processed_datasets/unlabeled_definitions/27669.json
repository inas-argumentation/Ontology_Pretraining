intentional or unintentional human actions."], "biological trait analysis": ["The process of examining specific characteristics or attributes of an organism or group of organisms to identify correlations with their ability to thrive and adapt in new environments, with the goal of gaining insights into the underlying factors driving their success or failure.", "The systematic examination of an organism's characteristics, such as body size, feeding habits, and reproductive patterns, to identify patterns and correlations that can inform our understanding of their invasive behavior and ecological impact.", "The examination of the characteristic features of organisms, often in a comparative framework, to uncover patterns and correlations between these features and their likelihood of thriving in new or non-native environments, thus providing insights into the determinants of invasion success.", "The systematic investigation of the inherent characteristics and attributes of a particular group of organisms to understand their capacities to adapt, survive, and thrive in new environments, thereby revealing patterns and relationships that can inform predictive models and management strategies for mitigating the impacts of invasive species.", "The systematic examination of a set of characteristic features or attributes possessed by organisms that can predict their capacity to adapt and thrive in new environments, ultimately informing strategies for managing the introduction and spread of non-native species."], "marine crabs": ["Large, conspicuous crustaceans with a penchant for traversing vast distances and exploiting novel environments, often with a propensity to adapt and thrive in these new settings.", "Large, often conspicuous, aquatic crustaceans with a varied range of native habitats, capable of successfully establishing themselves in foreign regions through adaptations that remain poorly understood for many species.", "Species of crustaceans that inhabit the ocean's coastal and shelf regions, often characterized by their mobility, size, and predatory habits, which have allowed them to successfully colonize and thrive in new environments.", "Large, often conspicuous, decapod crustaceans of diverse families and origins, which have developed remarkable success in expanding their ranges beyond their native territories and ecological niches.", "A group of large, conspicuous, and often highly mobile crustaceans that thrive in marine environments, often originating from specific regions and successfully establishing populations in new areas, characterized by their varied appearances, behaviors, and adaptations."], "marine invasive species": ["Species that have colonized regions beyond their native range, often exhibiting traits that enable them to thrive in new environments, despite potentially outcompeting native species for resources and altering ecosystem dynamics.", "A species of a certain type of large, often conspicuous, animal that originates from one specific region or ecosystem and establishes a self-sustaining population in a non-native area, often with potential to cause harm to the invaded ecosystem and potentially outcompete native species for resources.", "Species of large, conspicuous marine animals that have successfully established themselves in areas outside their native range, often with significant ecological and economic impacts.", "A species that has expanded its geographical range beyond its native boundaries, often via human activity, and has become established in a new region where it can cause ecological disruption or harm to native ecosystems.", "Large and conspicuous predators that have spread beyond their native ranges, often originating from a specific bioregion and overwhelming new ecosystems with their dominance."], "marine alien species": ["Species of marine crustaceans that have migrated outside their native habitats and have established self-sustaining populations in new regions, often exhibiting ecological and economic impacts.", "A species of crustacean or other marine animal that has expanded its geographic range beyond its natural or historic boundaries, often with significant ecological and economic impacts, and whose introduction is frequently associated with human activity or other environmental changes.", "Organisms native to one specific aquatic biome that have migrated to another, often causing ecological disruption and competition for resources with indigenous species.", "A non-native marine species that has established a self-sustaining population outside its native range, often characterized by its presence in waters distant from its ancestral habitat, which can lead to ecological, economic, and cultural disruptions.", "A non-native, species that originates from a distant region or ocean and establishes itself in a new, unconnected location, often exhibiting traits that enable its colonization and dominance over native species, commonly observed in predatory crustaceans."], "global distribution": ["The extent to which a particular type of organism, such as a marine crab, has spread across the globe, encompassing a wide range of ecosystems and geographical locations, often resulting from human activity or natural processes.", "The vast extent to which a particular group of organisms, such as marine crabs, has dispersed beyond their natural boundaries, resulting in their presence in various regions and ecosystems across the globe.", "The widespread dispersal of a biological group across multiple marine bioregions, with species often originating from a particular region and invading others, shaping their distribution through human activities, natural dispersal, or other means.", "The widespread and diverse presence of a particular group of organisms, as demonstrated by their ability to transcend geographical boundaries and inhabit multiple ecosystems across the globe, thereby highlighting their adaptability, resilience, and capacity to thrive in various environmental conditions.", "The widespread presence of a species or group across various geographical regions, encompassing different biomes and ecosystems, with potential dispersal paths and recipient areas shaped by factors such as ocean currents, human activities, and environmental conditions."]}
