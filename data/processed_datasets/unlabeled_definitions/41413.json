non-native species, and whose composition and structure are shaped by interactions with grazing animals, climate, and human activities.", "A type of ecosystem composed of plants with varying growth habits, leaf structures, and tolerance to disturbance, which, when influenced by grazing pressure, exhibit adaptations in species composition and community dynamics, resulting in a complex interplay of coexistence and competition between different plant life forms.", "A complex ecosystem comprising diverse, often flowering, plant species that thrive in open, temperate environments, characterized by their responses to grazing pressure from herbivores, which can stimulate the growth of certain plant types while shaping the overall community composition.", "A densely populated landscape of mixed
