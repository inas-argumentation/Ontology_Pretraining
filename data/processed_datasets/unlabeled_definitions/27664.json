the adaptation and population dynamics of the species over time, ultimately shaping its characteristics and impacts on the receiving ecosystem.", "The sum of events and processes that have occurred since a species first arrived in a new region, influencing its subsequent distribution, population dynamics, and ecological interactions, ultimately shaping its impact on the local ecosystem.", "The composite trajectory of events and conditions that shape the characteristics of a species or group of organisms as they transition from their native range to a new and often inhospitable environment,

the characteristics of an invasive species over time, resulting in a unique distribution and adaptation of its traits across its range."], "temporal variation": ["The dynamic change in the characteristics of an invasive species over a period of time, resulting in a varying impact on the local ecosystem, as influenced by seasonal or annual fluctuations in environmental factors and the species' history of colonization.", "The dynamic fluctuation in the characteristics or effects of an entity over a period of time, influenced by external factors, which can lead to changing levels of impact or risk to the surrounding environment or species.", "The fluctuation in characteristics or properties of a species over a specific period, driven by factors such as environmental conditions, population dynamics, and evolutionary pressures, resulting in a dynamic pattern of influence on its interactions with other organisms and its ecosystem.", "The fluctuations in the characteristics of an invasive species over time, which may be influenced by factors such as environmental conditions and colonization history, leading to changes in the species' impact on its native ecosystem.", "The dynamic shift in the expression of an organism's characteristics over a period of time, resulting from a combination of factors such as developmental stages, life cycles, and environmental influences, which in turn can influence its interactions with its ecosystem."], "environmental effects": ["The inherent variation in a species' characteristics, such as size and toxicity, that occurs as a result of the dynamic interplay between the species' biology and the physical and biological attributes of its habitat, which can have significant impacts on the predator-prey interactions and ecological balance of the invaded ecosystem.", "The influences exerted by external conditions and historical events on the development and expression of characteristics in a species, which can significantly impact the interactions and dynamics between the species and its environment.", "The cumulative influence of ecological factors on the development and variation of invasive species, resulting in changes to their physiological and behavioral characteristics that impact native ecosystems.", "The subtle yet significant shaping of an invasive species' characteristics by factors external to its genetics, such as temperature fluctuations, soil composition, and geographical isolation, which can influence its interactions with native organisms and the ecosystems it invades.", "The dynamic interplay between the invading organism's characteristics and the surrounding ecological context, giving rise to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the potential impact of the invasion."], "spatial variation": ["The pattern of differences in characteristics, outcomes, or effects observed across different geographical locations, reflecting the ways in which a phenomenon is shaped by the unique combinations of environmental conditions, historical events, and biological adaptations found in each area, and which can result in varying levels of impact, threat, or risk.", "The phenomenon where the characteristics of a particular entity or phenomenon vary in intensity, degree, or magnitude as one moves across different geographic locations or environments, often resulting in diverse impacts on local ecosystems and species interactions.", "The differing characteristics of an invasive species, such as body size and toxicity, that exist in different regions or areas, influencing the extent to which native predators are affected by its presence, creating a heterogeneous impact.", "The tendency of a species' physical characteristics, behavior, or toxicity to vary consistently across different locations, resulting in differential impacts on native predators.", "The differences in the characteristics and effects of an organism or phenomenon across distinct geographical areas,

that define an organism's shape, size, and structure, which influence its interaction with its environment and its impact on other organisms in its ecosystem.", "The physical characteristics that define an individual's form and structure, which in turn influence its interactions with its environment and other organisms, and can vary in a way that affects the impact it has on its ecosystem.",
