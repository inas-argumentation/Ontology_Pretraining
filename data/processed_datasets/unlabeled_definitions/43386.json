online activity.", "A statistical method that enables the examination of the effects of a specific event or policy on a particular outcome, by isolating the influence of the event or policy on the outcome while controlling for external factors that may also impact it, thereby providing a rigorous evaluation of the actual cause-and-effect relationship.", "A statistical method that helps policymakers assess whether a specific initiative, such as the creation of a list of invasive alien species, has caused a measurable impact on public interest or awareness, even amidst background noise and irregular fluctuations in data, allowing for informed decisions about future communication strategies and public engagement efforts.", "A research method that aims to measure the direct effect of a specific intervention or event on a targeted outcome, such as website traffic or public awareness, while controlling for external factors and identifying underlying patterns and correlations.", "An analytical approach used to quantify the effects of a particular event or intervention on a specific outcome, by comparing and controlling for the variables that influence that outcome, in order to isolate and measure the direct cause-and-effect relationship between the event or intervention and the outcome, and ultimately inform decision-making processes by shedding light on whether specific actions have the desired or intended impact."], "union list": ["A collective document listing the most significant and pressing threats to the ecological balance of a region,

threats to native ecosystems and economies."], "bayesian structural time series": ["A mathematical approach that examines the dynamic interactions between complex systems, uncovering the underlying patterns and relationships that govern their behavior over time, while accounting for the uncertainty and noise inherent in real-world data.", "The statistical analysis method used in this study involves examining the intricate patterns of data that unfold over time, taking into account the complex relationships between various events and their interactions, in order to better understand the dynamics of real-world phenomena.", "A statistical framework that analyzes the complex, dynamic patterns of interest in a specific topic, such as the public's curiosity about a particular issue, by examining the relationship between multiple factors, including external events, media coverage, and time, to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these factors influence the topic's popularity.", "A statistical approach that uses temporal data to identify patterns in the collective behavior of individuals, allowing policymakers to analyze the impact of initiatives on public awareness and curiosity about complex environmental issues, even when influenced by external factors such as media coverage.", "A methodological approach that combines the power of statistical analysis with the nuanced understanding of real-world phenomena to uncover the underlying patterns and trends in complex data sets, often used to identify correlations and predict outcomes in dynamic systems, such as the fluctuating public interest in invasive alien species."], "wikipedia searches": ["Online queries that analyze and track public interest in specific topics, often characterized by sporadic surges in attention sparked by media coverage of high-profile cases, rather than sustained curiosity driven by educational or informative resources.", "The act of querying an online encyclopedia-like platform to access and peruse collective information on a particular topic or issue, often driven by curiosity or a desire for knowledge, with the potential to reflect public interest and awareness about specific themes or concerns.", "Online inquiries about specific categories of exotic and often troublesome organisms, aimed at gathering information on their characteristics, habits, and potential impacts, often influenced by public awareness campaigns, media coverage, or regulatory efforts.", "A digital inquiry into the collective knowledge on the internet, often sparked by curiosity about a specific topic, resulting in a pattern of visits to online information sources that may fluctuate over time and be influenced by factors such as media coverage and attention to charismatic species.", "Online explorations of information about a specific topic or category, often triggered by public awareness campaigns, media coverage, or community interest, which can fluctuate in frequency and volume based on factors such as timeliness, novelty, and relevance."], "blacklists": ["A publicly accessible compilation of specimens deemed undesirable or harmful, aiming to raise awareness and inform decision-making about potential threats to ecosystems, but ultimately failing to spark widespread curiosity or interest.", "A categorization of unwanted entities, often publicly disclosed, that is intended to raise awareness and prevent further encroachment, yet may not necessarily spark widespread interest or curiosity.", "A formal catalog of unwanted entities, often made publicly available to raise awareness and promote understanding of a specific issue, but whose mere existence does not necessarily spark widespread curiosity or interest, and may only garner attention in response to sensationalized media coverage.", "A collection of widely disseminated, authoritative references that catalog and alert the public to the presence of unwelcome entities, often in a bid to educate and mobilize action against their potential harm.", "A curated collection of specific entities or items that have been deemed undesirable or threatening to a particular environment, economy, or ecosystem, often compiled with the intention of raising awareness and preventing further negative impacts."], "media coverage": ["The amplification
