decreases as that factor continues to increase, possibly due to the influence of evolutionary forces driving adaptation to changing environmental conditions.", "A pattern of variation in a trait where, in one context, selection pressures favor extreme values, whereas in another context, intermediate values are optimal, resulting in a nonlinear relationship between the trait and a relevant

organisms compete with one another for survival and reproduction, often resulting in the evolution of traits that enhance dispersal and colonization abilities, particularly in contexts where populations are expanding their range and adapting to new environments.", "The process by which different individuals of the same species within a population vie for limited resources, such as light,
