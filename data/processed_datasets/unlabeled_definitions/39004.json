and the availability of resources, resulting in a pattern of spatial relationships that can influence their behaviors, fitness, and overall success.", "The physical arrangement and positioning of individuals within a group or population, influenced by factors such as habitat features, food availability, and the presence of dominant or competing species, which ultimately affects their ability to coexist and interact with their environment.", "The arrangement of individuals within a group or population in a specific environment, taking into account the distribution of resources, predators, and competitors, which can be influenced by the presence of a dominant species, such as a introduced predator, altering the way individuals interact with their surroundings and each other.", "The arrangement and positioning of individuals within a shared environment, which is influenced by the presence of other species, and can result in a redistribution of resources and altered relationships between animals, ultimately impacting their ability to thrive in their ecological niche.", "The way in which individual members of a species adapt and adjust their location within a specific environment, often in response to the presence and behavior of other individuals, to optimize their access to essential resources and reduce potential threats."], "warpaint shiners": ["A small, agile, and native fish species that dwells in the shallower, higher-velocity regions of Appalachian streams, displaying a subtle yet adaptive shift in microhabitat preference when encountering invasive trout, and exhibiting diminished foraging success and spatial coordination as a result.", "A diminutive, agile fish species native to southern Appalachian streams, characterized by its preference for inhabiting specific mesohabitats and its remarkable ability to adapt to altered environmental conditions, while its foraging behavior is highly influenced by the presence of larger, invasive species.", "A small, native fish species that inhabits fast-moving waters with varied substrates, requiring a unique combination of agility and caution to navigate its surroundings while searching for food, and whose social behavior is strongly influenced by the presence of larger, non-native predators.", "A species of minnow that typically inhabits stream environments, exhibiting a preference for specific microhabitat characteristics, and displaying a significant departure in behavior and spatial organization when interacting with a foreign, introduced species.", "A small, stream-dwelling fish that habituates to specific microhabitats, displaying altered foraging behaviors and spatial arrangements when confronted with the presence of an invasive, larger competitor."], "social behavior": ["The tendency of individuals within a group to adopt spatial arrangements and interactions that are influenced by the presence of a dominant or competing species, often resulting in changes to their preferred habitat use and feeding patterns.", "The way individuals of the same species interact and respond to one another's presence, often revealing subtle adaptations to minimize competition, avoid predation, or optimize foraging in the face of changing environmental conditions.", "The way in which individuals of a species interact with each other when they are in close proximity, characterized by changes in spatial organization, avoidance patterns, and modified feeding behaviors.", "The complex and context-dependent interactions between individuals of the same species that influence their position, movement, and resource use within their environment, often driven by the presence or absence of a dominant or competitive force.", "The manner in which individuals of a species interact and
