{"indigenous-exotics and invasive species": ["Species that are naturally occurring in a region, co-evolved with the environment, and previously maintained a delicate balance with native inhabitants, but have suddenly become a dominant force in an ecosystem due to human activity, displacement of native species, and loss of ecological equilibrium, leading to significant ecological and economic disruption.", "The coexistence of native species that have evolved alongside local ecosystems and non-native species that have been introduced by human activity or natural means, which can have a profound impact on the ecological balance and threaten the survival of indigenous populations, thereby altering the original dynamics of the environment.", "Organisms that have adapted to a specific ecosystem, but which have been disrupted by the introduction of non-native species, leading to a complex interplay of ecological dynamics, where native predators and parasites are confronted with the challenge of controlling the spread of an invasive alien species.", "Species that are naturally occurring in a region, but have been displaced or outcompeted by foreign invaders that exploit their native ecosystem, leading to changes in population dynamics, community structure, and potentially even ecological succession.", "A type of organism that originates from a specific region or ecosystem, yet can establish itself in other areas through human activity or natural dispersal, potentially causing harm to native species and ecosystems."], "wood borers": ["Species of beetles that inhabit and feed on the internal tissues of trees, often causing significant damage and death to the host tree.", "Organisms that feed on the inner tissues of trees, often causing significant damage and potentially altering forest ecosystems.", "Organisms that feed on and damage the internal structures of certain tree species, often causing significant ecological and economic impacts through their invasive habits.", "A type of insect whose larvae feed on the internal tissues of trees, often causing significant damage to the tree's structure and leading to long-term decline or death, with some species having been accidentally introduced to new regions and becoming invasive pests.", "Small, typically larvae, insects that burrow into the tissues of trees, often causing significant damage and eventually killing the host plant."]}
