insects and potentially used in conjunction with chemical lures."], "branch traps": ["A device designed to capture insects by mimicking a natural habitat or visual cue, typically consisting of a small, portable structure affixed to a tree or branch, baited with a attractant or decoy.", "A type of surveillance device used to capture and monitor insects, typically consisting of a small, contained structure that mimics the appearance and scent of a beetle's natural habitat, placed on a tree branch or other vegetation to entice the target insect to land and become trapped.", "Small, portable containers that capture targeted insects by using visual lures or attractants, strategically placed on woody structures to monitor and collect specimens.", "Devices composed of suspended structures that utilize visual stimuli to attract and capture insects, typically placed within a plant's architecture to detect the presence of a targeted species.", "Devices used to monitor and
