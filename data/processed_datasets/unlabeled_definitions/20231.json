rapid spread of non-native plant species can have significant ecological impacts.", "A type of unique and fragile coastal ecosystem characterized by a dynamic equilibrium of wind-blown sands and native plant species, which can be threatened by the rapid and widespread invasion of non-native species, thereby highlighting the need for effective monitoring and management strategies to preserve its integrity.", "Coastal areas of sedimentary deposits that have been molded by wind and weather, characterized by a dynamic equilibrium between erosion and accretion, often featuring sparse vegetation and shifting sands that are susceptible to rapid changes in land cover and biodiversity, particularly in the presence of non-native plant species.", "A type of coastal landscape characterized by mobile and often stabilized deposits of sediment, where vegetation has adapted to thrive in a dynamic and fragile environment prone to modification by wind and water, with the presence of a specific non-native shrub species contributing to the area's ecological complexity."], "monitoring": ["The process of tracking changes in ecological environments by analyzing and interpreting recurring patterns of presence or absence of specific organisms or species over time and space, with the goal of anticipating their potential impact on the system and informing management decisions to mitigate unwanted consequences.", "A prolonged and systematic observation of a specific phenomenon's trajectory or spread to quantify its temporal and spatial patterns, ultimately providing valuable insights for management and informed decision-making.", "The systematic and longitudinal assessment of the spread and distribution of invasive species within a defined ecological

dunes": ["Narrow, linear strips of natural habitat found along the edge of a landmass where it meets the sea, characterized by the formation of loose, wind-transported sediment and a unique assemblage of plant species that are able to thrive in the dynamic conditions of frequent wind and salt spray.", "A fragile yet resilient ecosystem consisting of dynamic sandy ridges formed by the relentless interactions of wind, water, and vegetation, where the delicate balance of natural processes is increasingly threatened by the rapid spread of non-native plant species, which can have devastating consequences for the ecosystem's long-term sustainability.", "Areas of shifting sand along the shoreline, often formed by wind and water erosion, where delicate ecosystems are disrupted by the rapid spread of non-native plant species that can outcompete native vegetation and alter the natural dynamics of the environment.", "Areas of land, frequently modified by coastal erosion and sedimentation, characterized by the presence of sand, gravel, or other loose materials, and often inhabited by a variety of plant and animal species that play a crucial role in shaping the local ecosystem and are sensitive to changes brought about by invasive alien species.", "A unique and dynamic ecosystem formed along the shoreline, characterized by the gentle slope of loose, mobile sediments, which are susceptible to erosion and constant flux, yet provide a fragile haven for vegetation and wildlife adaptation."], "rosa rugosa": ["A highly adaptable, rapidly spreading, and resilient non-native thorny plant species, commonly found in coastal environments, known for its ability to thrive in diverse conditions and often outcompete native vegetation, leading to significant ecological changes.", "A
