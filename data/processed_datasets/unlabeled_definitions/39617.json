genetic variations in a particular species, displaying the distribution and connections between distinct genetic clusters within and between different populations."], "invasive populations": ["Species populations that are established outside their native range, where they have been introduced by human activity, and exhibit significant genetic variation and differentiation under new environmental conditions, resulting in potentially adverse ecological and biological impacts on the native ecosystem.", "Organisms that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new geographic area, where they may outcompete native species for resources and alter the local ecosystem, and which often exhibit genetic variation and adaptations that distinguish them from their original population or natural range.", "A group of organisms that has been introduced to a new geographic area through human activity, where they establish themselves and potentially outcompete or displace native species, altering the local ecological balance, often leading to changes in population dynamics, genetic variation, and community structure.", "A subset of non-native organisms that have colonized and established themselves in a new region, often exhibiting significant genetic variability and differentiation due to adaptation to novel ecological conditions, which can potentially outcompete or displace native species.", "Species or groups of organisms that, having been introduced to a non-native environment, have adapted to new ecological conditions and undergone significant genetic changes, potentially threatening the genetic integrity and ecosystem balance of the indigenous populations."]}
