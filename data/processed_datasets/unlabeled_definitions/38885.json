trade, notorious for its ability to establish populations in unintended environments, potentially posing a threat to local ecosystems.", "A carnivorous, voracious predator that can be found in home aquaria, tasked with eliminating unwanted snail species, but whose ability to adapt to diverse environments has led to its uninvited presence in the wild.", "A carnivorous, potentially invasive, and widely kept aquatic predator that is often sought after by enthusiasts to control pest snail populations in home aquariums, but has now been found to establish populations in non-native habitats."],

establishment in the wild due to its popularity in the pet trade.", "A carnivorous, aquatic gastropod known for its predatory habits, often kept in captivity to control pest snail populations, which has been established in the wild for the first time outside its native habitat.", "A small, carnivorous aquatic mollusk, highly valued among aquarium enthusiasts for its predatorial prowess, which can rapidly establish self-sustaining populations outside its native environment and potentially outcompete native species for resources.", "A carnivorous aquatic gastropod with a predatory reputation,

the DNA of a specific species, providing a unique identification marker that can be used to verify the presence of a non-native organism in an ecosystem, facilitating the monitoring and management of invasive populations.", "The genetic material extracted from a specific species, analyzed to identify its presence and origins in a particular ecosystem, often used to track and monitor the spread of non-native populations.", "A molecular fingerprint of a species, obtained through the analysis of a specific region of DNA, often used to confirm the presence and identify the source of a newly established population, particularly in cases where non-native species are introduced to the wild.", "Genetic barcodes obtained from the mitochondria of a species, used to identify and track the origin and spread of introduced non-native populations in the wild, particularly in the context of invasive species and ecological research.", "Genetic signatures from a specific area of a

"genetic identification": ["The process of using a specific sequence of characteristics found in the biological material of an organism to determine its authenticity and origins, much like tracing the roots of an unwanted intruder in a foreign environment to its natural habitat, where it can be contained and prevented from wreaking havoc on the native ecosystem.", "The process of determining the specific identity of a living organism through the examination of its distinctive molecular markers, allowing for accurate classification and detection of invasive species in their new habitats, even in the absence of visual confirmation.", "The process of identifying an organism based on the analysis of its unique biochemical signatures, which can be used to distinguish it from other species and verify its presence in a particular environment, thereby providing valuable insights into ecological interactions and potential risks to native populations.", "The process of discerning the unique characteristics of an organism by analyzing the building blocks of its life, thereby providing a precise way to distinguish it from others, often with significant implications for species
