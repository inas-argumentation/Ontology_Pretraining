infrastructure, and dependence on public seedlings, often managed by men with women contributing to feeding and daily operations.", "The cultivation of aquatic organisms in a small-scale, low-input manner, often in shallow ponds or wetlands, primarily for subsistence purposes and typically managed by local communities with limited resources.", "A sustainable farming practice that involves raising aquatic organisms, such as fish and shellfish, in a non-commercial and small-scale manner in natural or artificially constructed bodies of water, often relying on traditional knowledge and limited inputs, and is commonly practiced in rural areas where local communities depend on it for food and income.", "Small-scale, often subsistence-based, water-based agricultural practice that relies on minimal inputs and local resources, commonly adopted by rural communities in areas surrounding freshwater bodies, and often characterized by informal management and limited commercialization."], "lake victoria basin": ["A vast, naturally flood-prone region in eastern Africa characterized by sprawling wetlands, numerous small-scale farming communities, and a rich aquatic biodiversity, where the intersection of traditional agriculture and modern aquaculture practices raises concerns about environmental sustainability and socioeconomic equity.", "A region of eastern Africa characterized by a vast array of inland water systems, supporting a mix of traditional and innovative farming practices, including low-input and subsistence-based aquaculture, with potential environmental and socioeconomic implications that require careful management to balance conservation and community needs.", "A region comprising vast, interconnected wetlands and water bodies, characterized by a rich aquatic ecosystem and a reliance on subsistence farming practices, where the introduction of non-native species can have significant and far-reaching consequences for the environment and local communities.", "A vast, inland water ecosystem in East Africa, where the meeting of agricultural and fishery practices in the periphery of a vast freshwater lake creates a unique ecological and socioeconomic context that requires careful consideration to balance human livelihoods with environmental sustainability.", "A vast freshwater region in eastern Africa, characterized by extensive wetlands and a rich biodiversity, home to various traditional farming practices, including aquaculture, that require careful management to avoid degradation and ensure sustainability."], "aquaculture practice": ["The cultivation of aquatic life for food or income, typically characterized by small-scale, low-input operations using natural or managed environments, where producers may

typically involving the management of small-scale, low-input systems and often reliant on local resources and community participation.", "A sustainable and localized approach to cultivating water-based living organisms for food and livelihood purposes, typically involving minimal inputs, small-scale operations, and community-based management, with potential ecological and socioeconomic implications that require careful consideration and mitigation measures.", "The cultivation of aquatic organisms in a controlled environment, often relying on simple techniques and low input levels, with potential ecological and socioeconomic consequences that require careful management and consideration to avoid negative impacts on local communities and ecosystems.", "A farming activity

encompassing its frequency, scope, and level of impact on the surrounding environment and community.", "The level of development, intensity, and impact of a particular farming practice within a specific ecosystem, encompassing both the quantitative aspects of its implementation and the qualitative effects it has on the environment, communities, and overall well-being.", "The condition of being a non-traditional farming activity that is rapidly expanding, but requires careful management to avoid negative impacts on the surrounding environment and community, while also having the potential to provide a livelihood for individuals.", "A state of being characterized by a complex interaction of factors, including level of occurrence, manner of operation, and impact on the surrounding environment, which collectively determine the overall situation of a particular activity or practice in a given area.", "A condition characterized by a state of being, describing the
