international shipping connections.", "A prominent regional waterway that serves as a hub for the spread of non-native marine species, potentially radiating the invasion to other nearby bodies of water through a variety of routes, including the transport of animals on vessels and the movement of water currents."], "ballast water": ["A liquid or gaseous substance carried on a vessel, serving as a counterweight to stabilize its cargo or buoyancy, potentially transporting unwanted guests from one waterbody to another as it is transferred or discharged.", "A type of seawater carried within the hull of a vessel, serving to stabilize its equilibrium during transit, which may potentially harbor hitchhiking organisms and subsequently introduce them to new aquatic environments.", "The treated or untreated mixture of seawater and sediment carried in the hulls of vessels to stabilize them during travel, potentially transporting non-native species and altering the biodiversity of receiving waters.", "A liquid substance carried in ships to stabilize their balance and buoyancy during navigation, often unintentionally carrying foreign organisms and potentially disrupting the ecological balance of the receiving waterway.", "A type of cargo carried by ships that can potentially harbor and transport non-native species, facilitating their invasion of new aquatic ecosystems, often inadvertently and far from the original point of introduction."], "nonindigenous": ["Species found in a particular estuary, that did not naturally occur in that environment before human activities, such as shipping and aquaculture, had an opportunity to facilitate their introduction.", "A species that has unexpectedly emerged in a local ecosystem, having traveled a considerable distance without direct involvement with international trade routes, yet its presence is largely attributed to the unintended and far-reaching consequences of human activities.", "A species found in an estuary that did not historically coexist with it, often arriving via indirect routes such as human activities or natural currents, and whose presence disrupts the local ecosystem.", "A species whose presence in a particular region or ecosystem is not explained by its natural distribution or history of intentional introduction, but rather suggests an unconventional or indirect path of arrival, potentially via transportation routes, water currents, or other anthropogenic means.", "Species that have wandered into an environment without a direct link to international trade, yet still managed to arrive from distant waters, perhaps via unsuspecting boats, currents, or other invasive pathways."], "fouling": ["The unwanted, often unintentional, accumulation of living organisms on surfaces, facilitated by various waterborne vectors, including ocean currents, human activity, and the transportation of aquatic goods.", "The unwanted attachment or colonization of surfaces by living organisms, often facilitated by waterborne transportation, allowing invasive species to hitchhike across distances and establish themselves in new habitats.", "The accumulation of unwanted organisms, often transported through waterways, on surfaces or structures that come into contact with aquatic environments, resulting in the unintended introduction of non-native species.", "The unintentional transport of biological organisms, particularly small invertebrates, on the surface of objects or in crevices, often as a result of human activity or natural water currents, which can facilitate their introduction to new environments and potentially disrupt local ecosystems.", "The unwanted attachment of aquatic life, often as a byproduct of water travel or other human activities, to surfaces that are meant to remain clean and free of foreign organisms, thereby compromising their intended purpose or affecting their ecological integrity."], "nonnative": ["A species found in a specific ecosystem that has made its way there through unintentional or unregulated means, often carried by natural or human-induced vectors, such as water currents, ships, or other organisms, and can potentially alter the native balance of the ecosystem.", "A species that has made its way into a new ecosystem through human activity or other indirect means, often originating from a distant location, and has established a viable population that can potentially disrupt the native balance.", "Species that have been transported to a new geographic location through natural or anthropogenic means, and have established a reproducing population, often adapting to and altering the native ecosystem, without having evolved there over a significant period of time.", "A species found in an environment where it did not evolve or naturally occur, possibly having arrived through human activities or natural means, and is capable of establishing a self-sustaining population, often with potential to outcompete native species and alter ecosystem dynamics.", "A species introduced into a particular ecosystem through routes other than direct international trade or commerce, but may have still arrived through complex
