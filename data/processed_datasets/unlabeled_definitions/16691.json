ecological dynamics and potentially altering ecosystem balance.", "The subset of a region's ecological profile that remains invisible to observation, yet is poised to emerge and have a significant impact on the local environment, reflecting the underlying distribution patterns and connectivity of species.", "The unexplored yet present potential of a region's flora, comprised of species that have not yet colonized a specific site but are latent in the surrounding area, ready to migrate and potentially disrupt the local ecosystem balance."], "future invasion risks": ["The probability of unfamiliar plant species spreading and establishing themselves in a given region, potentially altering its ecological balance and native flora, which is often driven by factors such as human activity and environmental disturbance, and is inherently tied to the presence of similar, yet absent, species in surrounding areas.", "The likelihood of unforeseen ecological disruptions resulting from the gradual accumulation of previously absent plant species in a particular region, triggered by factors such as demographic growth, agricultural activity, and environmental disturbance.", "The likelihood of non-native plant species, which are currently absent from a particular area but have the potential to establish themselves, to colonize and potentially disrupt the ecological balance in the region in the future.", "The potential for non-native plant species to disperse and establish themselves in new areas, potentially outcompeting native species and altering ecosystems, which is influenced by factors such as regional biodiversity, human population density, and land-use patterns.", "The likelihood of novel species presences in a particular region, brought about by the accumulation of ecological niches being filled by species not originally native to that area, which may lead to unintended ecological consequences."], "diversity metrics": ["A statistical assessment of the variation in species distribution, abundance, and ecological niche occupancy, often used to identify regions of high conservation priority and predict potential threats to native ecosystems.", "A numerical indicator measuring the complexity and structure of a ecological community's species composition, encompassing the presence and potential presence of species at a given location, which serves as a proxy for predicting the likelihood and potential impact of non-native species colonization and the associated ecological consequences.", "A method of quantifying the complexity and variety of living organisms present in a given region or ecosystem, taking into account not only the types of species that are currently observed but also the potential species that are absent but capable of colonization.", "Measures that reveal the scope and variation of species presence or potential presence in a particular area, taking into account both the number of species already observed and those that may be missing but capable of establishing themselves, in order to gauge the potential risks and patterns of species distribution.", "A measure of the extent to which different components of a ecological community occupy or are potentially present in a given area, reflecting the abundance and distribution of various species, their ability to colonize, and the underlying environmental conditions."], "alien plant species": ["Species of plants introduced by human activity from outside their natural geographic range, which are capable of thriving in European environments and potentially disrupting native ecosystems, with some having already established themselves in certain regions and others yet to be detected.", "Species of non-native flora that have established populations in a given region, and potentially pose a threat to the region's ecological balance and biodiversity, often driven by human activities such as globalization, trade, and habitat disturbance.", "Species of plants that have entered an ecosystem from a different geographic region or habitat, potentially altering the native plant community's diversity and ecological balance.", "Non-native flora that have colonized areas outside their natural geographic range, often as a result of human activity or unintentional introduction, and can potentially outcompete or displace native plant species, altering ecosystems and posing a threat to biodiversity.", "Species of plants that are non-native to a region or ecosystem, often introduced through human activities such as trade, travel, or deliberate or accidental transportation, and can potentially outcompete or displace native plant species, altering the local biodiversity and ecological balance."], "diversity indices": ["A measure that represents the varied presence and potential presence of different types of organisms in a given area, revealing the extent to which these entities are not only scattered but also have the capacity to spread and potentially impact their surroundings.", "The measure of how distinct and widespread the variety of species, including those already present and those potentially able to colonize a given area, contribute to the ecological composition of a region.", "A quantifiable measure that reveals the level of ecological complexity within a particular region, reflecting the coexistence of various plant species, including those that are present, absent, yet potentially colonizable, and those that are invasive.", "A measure that quantifies the range and distribution of species present in a particular area, accounting for both the visible presence of a species and the potential presence of species that have not yet colonized the area, providing insight into the ecological dynamics and future scenarios of species interactions.", "A measure that captures the complexity of ecological communities by quantifying the extent to which different populations of plant species coexist and are present in a given area, taking into account both the observable species richness and the presence of species that are potentially present but not yet detected, thus providing insight into the current and future state of the ecosystem."], "plant species distribution": ["The spatial pattern of the presence and absence of multiple kinds of flowering plant life forms across a vast geographic area, where some regions exhibit a higher concentration of varied forms and others have fewer, reflecting various environmental and human-induced influences.", "The spatial arrangement of distinct types of flora, reflecting their varying abilities to occupy and thrive within specific territories, shaped by a complex interplay of environmental, ecological, and anthropogenic factors, influencing the level of colonization and coexistence with native species.", "The widespread pattern of existence and frequency of various organisms across different areas, indicating the likelihood

arrangement of distinct types of vegetation, reflecting the pattern of presence and absence of various forms of flora across a region or landscape, which can be used to infer the likelihood of invasion by non-native plant populations."]}
