have detrimental effects on human health, aquatic ecosystems, and the economy when introduced to new or unprepared environments.", "Organisms that inhabit aquatic environments and are capable of producing toxic compounds, which can disrupt the balance of ecosystems and have significant economic and ecological consequences, potentially affecting human health and aquatic biodiversity.", "Toxic aquatic microorganisms that can cause widespread ecological and economic damage through the degradation of water quality, posing a significant threat to human health and the environment, and their invasive presence can have devastating effects on the global economy.", "Microorganisms that can contaminate waterways, posing threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health, primarily by producing potent toxins and unpleasant odors, which can have devastating impacts on the environment and the economy."], "invacost": ["A comprehensive database that systematically quantifies the economic repercussions of unforeseen and unwanted biological incursions into ecosystems, shedding light on the previously underestimated costs of environmental disruptions and promoting a more informed understanding of the complex interplay between ecological and economic systems.", "A database or framework that quantifies the monetary and economic costs of unwelcome and non-native species that infiltrate and disrupt ecosystems, ultimately affecting global economies and water quality, serving as a crucial tool for policymakers and scientists to understand and mitigate the impacts of biological invasions.", "A compilation of financial estimates assessing the adverse effects of unwanted foreign organisms on the global economy, providing a framework for understanding the magnitude and complexity of the ecological and economic consequences of their presence.", "A comprehensive database quantifying the unappreciated economic repercussions of invasive organisms on global economies, highlighting the urgent need for assessment and mitigation of their far-reaching impacts on ecosystems and human well-being.", "A comprehensive catalog of the monetary value of disturbances caused by foreign organisms entering an ecosystem, allowing for a detailed understanding of the economic and environmental consequences of these incursions and informing strategic decisions for their mitigation and management."], "costs": ["The economic valuation of losses or expenses incurred by human societies as a result of disruptions to aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity caused by the introduction of non-native plankton species, which can manifest in various forms, including harm to human health, damage to infrastructure, and diminished ecosystem services.", "The aggregate value of damage, degradation, or disruption to the global aquatic ecosystems and human activities, resulting from the introduction and spread of non-native planktonic species, thereby affecting biodiversity, ecosystem services, and economic productivity.", "The measurable financial consequences of adverse effects on aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem services, resulting from the presence of non-native plankton species in a waterbody.", "The tangible and intangible expenses incurred due to the disruption of aquatic ecosystems and subsequent effects on biodiversity, economy, and water quality,

balance caused by the introduction of non-native organisms, which can lead to diminished aquatic biodiversity, impaired ecosystem services, and decreased human well-being."], "harmful algal bloom": ["Proliferations of microorganisms in aquatic ecosystems that can have severe and far-reaching consequences, such as altering ecosystem services, disrupting biodiversity, and imposing significant economic burdens, often due to their invasive nature and toxic or noxious properties.", "A sudden and widespread proliferation of tiny, usually microscopic, organisms in a waterbody, causing detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems, human health, and global economies, often driven by factors such as climate change, pollution, and human activity.", "The unforeseen and often overlooked mass proliferation of microscopic aquatic organisms, which can disrupt ecosystems, compromise water quality, and result in substantial economic costs, while remaining inadequately documented and underestimated by traditional assessment methods.", "Proliferations of microorganisms, such as certain cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates, that can harm aquatic ecosystems and human activities, often accompanied by economic costs and neglect of their ecological impacts.", "A type of ecological disturbance caused by an unwanted accumulation of certain microscopic aquatic organisms, resulting in adverse impacts on aquatic biodiversity, ecosystem services, and potentially affecting human economic activities by imposing significant and underestimated costs."]}
