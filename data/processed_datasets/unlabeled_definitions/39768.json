way for the rapid establishment of invasive populations.", "A small, native crustacean species that plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of estuarine ecosystems, particularly in European waters, but has faced significant decline due to various factors, leading to an ecological void that invasive species can exploit.", "A type of native mysid species found in European estuaries, which plays a vital role in the marine ecosystem, but its numbers are dwindling due to the introduction of non-native species that outcompete for resources and habitat.", "A species of marine crustacean that is native to certain European estuaries and has previously been the dominant inhabitant of certain regions, but has seen a decline in population over time.", "A species of mysid that has long
