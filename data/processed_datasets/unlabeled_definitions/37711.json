introduced to a new environment with distinct ecological pressures, potentially leading to rapid spread and establishment.", "The initial introduction of a non-native species with a trait or

outcompete native species for resources.", "The zone where a non-native species has adapted to thrive in a new environment, often exhibiting increased vigour due to the absence of biotic and abiotic constraints present in its native habitat, and potentially influenced by the presence of pre-adapted individuals that have increased its fitness.", "The area where an alien species is deliberately or accidentally brought and established outside its natural geographic boundaries, potentially leading to ecological changes and outcompeting native species, often exhibiting altered traits and behaviors
