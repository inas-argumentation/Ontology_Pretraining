{"urban heat island effect": ["The phenomenon where human activities and constructions alter the natural temperature patterns in a region, creating areas with consistently higher temperatures than surrounding environments, often favoring the persistence of certain non-native species.", "The phenomenon by which human activities and infrastructure create localized areas with increased

increased human activity and infrastructure to become warmer than surrounding natural environments, potentially creating an artificial thermal refuge that can facilitate the persistence of non-native species.", "The phenomenon where altered microclimates surrounding human-made structures, such as greenhouses or cities, become significantly warmer than adjacent natural environments due to the concentration of heat-absorbing surfaces and increased atmospheric disturbance, potentially influencing the behavior and physiological responses of ectothermic organisms.", "The phenomenon of

structures to provide a climate-borne haven and thereby escaping the natural constraints that govern its population growth and dispersal.", "A tropical, small-bodied reptile that has leveraged the convenience of human-made structures to thrive in environments far beyond its original range, often relying on microclimates to mitigate the stresses of its new surroundings.", "A tropical reptile
