maintaining the balance of communities by providing shelter and resources for numerous invertebrates and other organisms.", "A type of underwater grass that serves as a foundation species in coastal ecosystems, providing a habitat for diverse invertebrate communities, which is vulnerable to colonization by invasive species that can outcompete the native vegetation and alter the community structure.", "A type of aquatic plant, which, as a foundation species, provides habitat and sustenance for a diverse array of epifauna, but is also vulnerable to the impact of invasive species that can overgrow its shoots and disrupt its growth and community dynamics.", "A delicate, underwater grass-like ecosystem anchor that provides shelter and sustenance for a diverse array of marine life, whose delicate balance can be disrupted by the unwanted presence of invasive colonial organisms.", "A type of underwater grass that serves as a foundation species, providing crucial habitat for a diverse array of epifauna, but is vulnerable to degradation due to the overgrowth of invasive species."], "fouling": ["The unwanted colonization of a host surface by a non-native, attached organism, leading to potential modifications of the host's structure, growth, and ecological interactions.", "The unwanted and excessive colonization of a host organism or structure by a non-native or invasive species, resulting in a decline in the health and function of the host, and often leading to alterations in the associated community dynamics.", "The unwanted and often unchecked growth of an organism onto or around another, resulting in a restriction or disruption of the other's normal function, appearance, or ability to thrive, often leading to unintended consequences for the impacted ecosystem.", "The process by which a foreign organism attaches itself to and overgrows a native plant, altering its growth patterns and potentially disrupting the surrounding ecosystem.", "The unwanted accumulation of organisms or materials on a host surface, often causing detrimental effects on its growth, morphology, or ecological interactions, as exemplified by the attachment of certain species to eelgrass in a coastal environment."], "eelgrass": ["A type of coastal marine vegetation that serves as a foundation species in its ecosystem, providing a habitat and food source for a diverse array of epifauna, but is also vulnerable to invasive species that can alter its growth patterns and morphology.", "A perennial aquatic grass-like species that serves as a keystone foundation in coastal ecosystems, supporting a diverse array of epifauna and playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of these environments.", "A type of underwater vegetation that serves as a foundation species in coastal communities, providing a habitat for a diverse array of epifauna and playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of these ecosystems.", "A type of underwater vegetation that serves as a foundation species in coastal communities, playing a vital role in supporting a diverse array of epifauna, but whose growth and morphology can be impaired by the attachment

organisms, but is vulnerable to invasive species that can outcompete it for space and resources."], "invasive tunicate": ["A sessile marine organism that can dramatically alter the structure and diversity of native coastal ecosystems, often outcompeting and smothering native species, and has the potential to profoundly disrupt the delicate balance of these ecosystems.", "A specific type of marine animal that has been introduced to a new environment, where it attaches itself to and overgrows native underwater vegetation, potentially disrupting the balance of the ecosystem and altering the growth and morphology of the affected plants.", "A non-native, colonial organism that rapidly grows and forms a thick layer on native aquatic plants, potentially disrupting their structure,
