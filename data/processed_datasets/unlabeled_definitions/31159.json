environments, often by exploiting unique ecological niches and forming complex relationships with other species.", "Species that have adapted to thrive in environments where ancient inhabitants are being pushed out by newer arrivals, exploiting unique microhabitats and finding ways to coexist with predators that once kept them in check, all while subtly altering the dynamics of their

presence of invasive substrates, leveraging them as shelter from predators and potentially outcompeting native species for resources.", "A small, adaptable crustacean that has successfully exploited human-mediated invasions of native ecosystems, often outcompeting and replacing native species in its new habitat.", "A small, invasive freshwater crustacean that has adapted to thrive in areas dominated by a dominant, non-native mussel species, leveraging its unique ability to exploit this habitat for shelter and protection, ultimately outcompeting native species for resources.", "A small, aquatic crustacean that has evolved to thrive in environments dominated by invasive species, leveraging these species' structures for shelter and protection from predators, but is ultimately vulnerable to predation despite its adaptive abilities."], "predator exclusion": ["The manipulation of a habitat to artificially protect a species from natural suppressors, allowing the species to thrive in a controlled environment, thereby enabling researchers to isolate and quantify the impact of predation on the population dynamics of the species of interest.", "The manipulation of an environment to separate prey species from their natural predators, allowing researchers to examine the responses of these prey species in the absence of predation pressure, thereby revealing the underlying dynamics of ecological interactions.", "The process of restricting access to a specific environment or resource, thereby allowing a particular species to exploit it without competition or predation, which can facilitate its expansion and population growth.", "The removal or inhibition of a dominant force in an ecosystem that would normally suppress the population growth of a species, thereby creating a artificial environment that allows a different species to flourish or interact with its environment in a manner that would not occur naturally.", "A method of experimentation that simulates the absence of a natural entity, thereby allowing researchers to isolate the effect of that entity's presence on the behavior, population dynamics, or ecological interactions of other organisms in a specific environment."], "predator-prey": ["The complex interplay between a species that monopolizes a preferred environment, creating a haven for an invasive competitor, and another species that historically occupied that environment, but is now vulnerable to predation and competition in its own domain.", "A relationship in which one species seeks to exploit another as a source
