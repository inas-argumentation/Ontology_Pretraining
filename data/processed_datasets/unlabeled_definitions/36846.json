unwelcome expansion.", "A prickly yet persistent coastal wanderer, notorious for rewriting the rules of its adopted habitats and impeding the natural progression of native flora and fauna.", "A highly invasive, coastal-dwelling shrub with a knack for dominating local soil ecosystems and stifling native vegetation, often accumulating thick layers of litter that can impede ecosystem recovery and facilitate its own spread.", "A woody, highly invasive coastal plant that can alter soil chemistry, form dense litter layers, and outcompete native species, posing a significant threat to ecosystem recovery and restoration efforts."], "litter": ["The uppermost layer of decaying organic matter that accumulates on soil surfaces, formed through the breakdown of plant material, and characterized by its ability to modify soil properties and create a barrier to the growth of native vegetation.", "The layer of organic matter deposited on the soil surface by plant species, often formed through a complex interaction of vegetation, decomposition, and environmental factors, which can exert a significant influence on the germination, growth, and establishment of subsequent plant populations.", "The decomposing organic matter formed by the natural breakdown of plant material, which can accumulate in significant amounts in environments where invasive species dominate, potentially hindering the recovery of native ecosystems and facilitating the further spread of invasives.", "The accumulated, decaying remnants of plant matter that can form a dense, complex layer on the soil's surface, potentially altering its physical and chemical properties, and influencing the growth and development of native and invasive species.", "The accumulation of organic matter on the surface of soil, resulting from the decomposition of plant material and other biological residues, which can influence the physical and chemical properties of the surrounding environment and affect the growth and survival of vegetation."], "coastal dunes": ["A naturally occurring landscape feature characterized by a unique combination of wind-sculpted vegetation, nutrient-rich soil, and accumulated organic matter, which creates a dynamic ecosystem susceptible to ecological disruption from invasive species.", "Dynamic natural systems of shifting sands and plant communities that are shaped by prevailing winds and waves, where native vegetation is often vulnerable to displacement by invasive species that alter soil composition and create a barrier to recovery.", "Ephemeral, dynamic ecosystems
