consume its food.", "A crustacean with a reputation for destruction, characterized by its robust pincer-like claws that can exert considerable force, making it a formidable predator capable of crushing shells and posing a significant threat to native shellfish populations."], "carcinus maena": ["A certain species of green crab, widely distributed and notorious for its ability to exert significant force through its pincer-like appendages, capable of crushing shells and adapting its feeding behavior to consume a variety of molluscan prey.", "A prolific and formidable invasive species of crustacean, renowned for its ability to flexibly manipulate shells and mollusks using its claw-like appendages, thereby exemplifying its adaptability and predatorial prowess.", "A certain species of crustacean, native to Europe but notorious for its invasive tendencies in North American waters, is renowned for its remarkable chelae, capable of generating considerable force and allowing it to devastatingly crush the shells of certain prey, while others escape its grasp.", "A highly adaptable, shell-crushing crustacean species with a remarkable ability to scale its mechanical prowess in relation to its body size, capable of devastating the ecosystem balance and threatening the livelihood of shellfish aquaculture in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada.", "A species of crab known for its invasive tendencies, characterized by its remarkable ability to exert crushing forces with its claws, which are ideal for preying on specific shells, but also vary in their force application
