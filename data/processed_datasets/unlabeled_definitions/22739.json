exhibiting a unique set of characteristics that enables it to thrive in a variety of environments, often outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem processes.", "Species of thorny trees or shrubs commonly planted worldwide for various purposes, but some of which have spread beyond cultivation and become a threat to native ecosystems due to their ability to thrive in a wide range of climates and their adaptability to being dispersed by humans.", "A group of deciduous shrubs and trees that, although native to a specific region, have been widely introduced and cultivated globally for various purposes, often escaping cultivation and establishing themselves in new environments where they can outcompete native vegetation and alter ecosystem processes, particularly in areas with similar climatic conditions to their original habitat.", "A type of flowering plant native to Australia, known for its striking appearance, adaptability to various environments, and propensity to thrive in new regions, often spreading and altering ecosystems through human introduction and natural dispersal processes."], "niche width": ["The scope of a species' adaptation to varying
