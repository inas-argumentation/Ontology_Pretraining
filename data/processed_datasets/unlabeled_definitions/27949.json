growth, productivity, and ecosystem health, and can be facilitated by human activities such as introducing non-native plant species.", "The widespread affliction of plant tissues by pathogens that cause damage, discoloration, or reduced productivity, typically manifesting as unsightly lesions, cankers, or other visual deformities on the leaves, stems, or fruiting bodies of the infected plants, with significant implications for their health, ecology, and human exploitation."], "leaf spot": ["Small, discolored patches that form on the leaves of certain plants, often caused by the presence of a fungal or bacterial pathogen, which can lead to significant damage or even death of the plant tissue if left untreated, and can have devastating effects on ecosystems and economies if the affected plant is a key species in its native habitat or is widely cultivated for food, timber, or other purposes.", "A symptom of plant disease characterized by discolored, scattered, and often scattered patches on the leaves, caused by the introduction of fungal pathogens that have adapted to infect native hosts.", "A distinctive discoloration or malformation on the surfaces of leaves, typically caused by a fungal pathogen that has adapted to infect specific plant hosts and has the potential to cause significant disease problems, especially when it jumps from one host to another.", "A fungal disease characterized by distinctive circular or irregular lesions on plant foliage, often caused by the transfer of pathogenic organisms from one plant species to another, resulting in potential ecological and economic disruptions.", "Discolorations and degradation of the foliar surface caused by the presence and activities of fungal pathogens, often resulting in unsightly and potentially damaging lesions on plants, and potentially facilitated by the introduction of non-native hosts or environmental factors."], "host jumps": ["The process by which a fungal pathogen expands its host range to infect native plant species after being introduced to a new geographic region through the cultivation of non-native plants, often resulting in significant disease pressure and potential ecological and economic impacts.", "The process by which a fungal pathogen, initially adapted to infect one plant species, evolves to colonize and cause disease in a related or distant plant species, often as a result of intentional or unintentional introduction to a new ecosystem, with potential consequences for disease outbreaks and ecological imbalance.", "The sudden and unanticipated adaptation of a microorganism to a novel host species, often resulting from anthropogenic introductions, which can have significant consequences for the affected ecosystem.", "The process by which a fungus or other microorganism shifts its affinity from a non-native host plant to a native plant species, allowing it to thrive and potentially cause disease.", "The transfer of a fungal pathogen from a non-native, cultivated host plant to a native, related host plant, resulting in the establishment of a previously unknown or potentially problematic disease."], "native myrtaceae": ["Woody plants indigenous to a specific region, often characterized by fragrant oils and showy flowers, which have evolved in harmony with local environments and microorganisms.", "Species of flowering plants native to the Southern Hemisphere, characterized by their fragrant leaves and brightly colored fruit, commonly found in subtropical regions and often associated with fungal pathogens that have adapted to infect them.", "Species of flowering plants, commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, whose native habitats have been relatively untouched by human activity, and which are naturally distributed in a specific geographical area, without intentional or large-scale introduction by humans.", "Plants belonging to a group of species that are originally found in a particular region or ecosystem, and have evolved in response to local conditions, which can make them vulnerable to new diseases introduced by non-native species.", "The term refers to a group of plant species that are endemic to a particular region, have evolved independently over time, and play a crucial role in the ecosystem and biodiversity of that region, often serving as hosts to various pathogens and pests,
