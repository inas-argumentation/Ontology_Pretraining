non-native species into a new region, often facilitated by human activities and resulting in the alteration of ecological dynamics and potential disruptions to local ecosystems.", "The deliberate or accidental introduction of non-native plant or animal species into a new ecosystem, resulting in potential disruption of the natural balance, through various routes, such as human activity, environmental factors, or geographic proximity, with the potential to spread rapidly and outcompete native species for resources.", "The uncontrolled and often unintended introduction of a non-native species into a new ecosystem, where it can outcompete native species for resources and alter the region's ecological balance, often facilitated by human activities or natural dispersal patterns.",
