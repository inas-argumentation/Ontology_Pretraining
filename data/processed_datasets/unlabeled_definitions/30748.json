factors such as heat and smoke, thereby affecting the composition of species that emerge.", "A layer of organic material on the soil surface that, when disturbed, can either facilitate or hinder the emergence of plant species, its composition and structure influencing the trajectory of ecosystem recovery."], "resilience": ["The capacity of an ecosystem to rebound and regain its pre-disturbance

by the complex interplay between fire, soil seed banks, and vegetation structure.", "The capacity of an ecosystem to dynamically adapt and re-establish its original composition and functionality following disturbances, with the ability to do so influenced by the diversity and vitality of its underlying resource base, which includes the latent potential for species regeneration from stored seeds, but also acknowledges the possibility that other mechanisms may be necessary for complete recovery.", "The ability of a ecosystem to retain its original character and composition, despite the presence of disturbances or invasive species, through the capacity to regenerate and recolonize its native flora from various sources, including the soil seed bank.", "The ability of an ecosystem to adapt and reform in response to disturbances, ultimately reflecting its capacity to withstand and recover from the loss of dominant species and the degradation of its constituent elements, thereby returning to a previously stable or preferred state.", "The ability of an ecosystem to return to its pre-impacted state after a disturbance, such as shrub encroachment, by leveraging the stored
