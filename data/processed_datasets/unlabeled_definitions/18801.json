regions, including islands, continents, and countries, with the aim of establishing populations, often in the absence of natural predators, where their survival and spread are influenced by factors such as propagule size, local ecological conditions, and historical context.", "Small to medium-sized songbirds, often characterized by their remarkable ability to thrive in diverse environments, whose introduction outcomes are influenced by a complex interplay of factors beyond just the initial number of individuals released, and whose successful colonization is more often attributed to subtle interactions between species, site, and environment rather than simply the \"pressure\" exerted by a large enough population.", "A type of bird characterized by its small to medium body size, migratory behavior, and tendency to thrive in areas with complex environmental pressures, often succeeding or failing in regions dependent on factors other than the initial number of individuals released.", "A group of birds characterized by their reliance on insect-based diets and adaptable characteristics, which enable them to thrive in a wide range of environments, including those where human intervention has altered their natural distribution.", "Small to medium-sized birds that often colonize new territories through controlled releases, which has led some researchers to question whether the number of individuals introduced is the primary determinant of success or failure."], "bird introductions": ["The deliberate or unintentional movement of individuals of a particular avian group from their natural range to a new geographic area, often with the intention of establishing a self-sustaining population.", "The intentional relocation of a group of animals from their native
