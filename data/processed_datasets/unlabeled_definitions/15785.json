{"global patterns of alien species": ["The distribution of non-native organisms across the globe, characterized by an irregular presence in certain regions, often associated with human activities, and susceptible to divergent opinions among experts regarding their natural versus introduced status, despite their potential for long-distance dispersal.", "The spatial distribution of organisms that are introduced and establish themselves outside their natural range, often exhibiting unusual geographic ranges or ecological preferences, and are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty and expert disagreement about their native or non-native status.", "The occurrence and distribution of non-indigenous species across the world, characterized by uncertainty in their original habitats and dispersal mechanisms, often relying on indirect human-related associations, and frequently subject to expert interpretation.", "Unusual geographical distributions and ecological associations of certain non-native organisms, often characterized by co-occurrences with human activities and disturbed environments, and resulting in divergence of expert opinions on their native or invasive status.", "The distribution and spread of non-indigenous plant species across the globe, resulting from human activities and natural dispersal mechanisms, which exhibit unique characteristics in their geographical range, habitat preferences, and association with human transportation, leading to varying expert opinions on their native or invasive status in different regions."], "species status": ["The categorization of a specific taxonomic entity's provenance in a particular geographic region, encompassing both its origin and mode of introduction, often reliant on expert judgment and requiring ongoing assessment due to potential uncertainty and variability in assessment outcomes.", "The condition that determines the degree of association between a particular entity and a specific geographic location, taking into account various factors such as dispersal capabilities, habitat preferences, and potential means of human transport.", "The categorical classification of an organism's presence in a specific area, taking into account its geological distribution, environmental preferences, and association with human activities, while acknowledging that expert opinions may diverge due to the complex nature of long-distance dispersal.", "The inherent classification of a biological entity within a specific geographic context, taking into account its distribution, habitat preferences, and potential associations with human activity, which may be subject to variability in interpretation among experts due to the entity's inherent dispersal capabilities and the complexity of its introduction pathways.", "The classification of an organism's affinity to a specific geographic location, based on its distribution pattern, habitat preference, and association with human-mediated transport, which may be subject to expert interpretation and variation."], "cryptogenic species": ["A species of plant whose origin in a given region is uncertain, despite exhibiting atypical geographic distribution patterns or association with human-mediated transportation, and whose classification as native or non-native is subject to ongoing expert debate and consideration of uncertain evidence.", "A species whose presence in a given region is uncertain and may be attributed to either natural or anthropogenic means of dispersal, leaving experts with divergent opinions on its native or invasive status.", "Species whose geographic distribution and habitat preferences exhibit unusual patterns that may or may not be indicative of human-mediated introduction, leaving room for divergent expert opinions and necessitating further evidence to confirm their native or invasive status.", "A species whose geographical distribution is ambiguous due to its ability to disperse over long distances, resulting in discrepancies in expert opinions regarding its native or introduced status in a particular region, and whose presence requires further investigation to determine its origin.", "A species whose geographical distribution appears anomalous, often preferring disturbed or human-altered habitats, and exhibits indirect associations with human activities, leaving room for debate among experts regarding its true native range and potential for long-distance dispersal."], "bryophytes": ["Non-vascular plants with remarkable dispersal abilities, often thriving in disturbed environments, whose native or invasive status is subject to expert interpretation and can be influenced by indirect indicators.", "Non-vascular, often diminutive, terrestrial plants capable of long-distance dispersal, whose peculiar distributions and habitat preferences may be influenced by human activity, yet their native or introduced status can be subject to expert interpretation.", "Small, non-vascular, usually green plants that can disperse far distances and sometimes exhibit anomalous geographical distributions, preferring disturbed habitats, with experts occasionally disagreeing on their native, introduced, or uncertain status in a given region.", "Non-vascular, terrestrial plants with excellent dispersal capabilities, often found in disturbed environments, whose native or invasive status can be subject to scientific debate.", "Non-vascular, liverwort-like plants that thrive in diverse environments, often found in disturbed habitats, and display remarkable abilities for long-distance dispersal, occasionally sparking debates among experts regarding their origin and status in a given region."], "non-indigenous": ["A species whose geographical distribution is aberrant, often exhibiting a preference for disturbed habitats and potentially linked to human-mediated dispersal methods, but whose true origin remains uncertain and may be subject to expert interpretation.", "A plant species whose extraterrestrial-like characteristics are evident in its atypical distribution, affinity for disturbed environments, and subtle connections to human activities, suggesting a non- native presence, but requires further investigation to confirm its true origins.", "A species whose geographic distribution is characterized by an anomalous pattern, often found in habitats disturbed by human activities, with a potential for long-distance dispersal, leading to differences in opinion among experts regarding its native status in a given region.", "A plant species found in a region, exhibiting an atypical distribution pattern or association with human activity, which may be subject to diverging opinions among experts regarding its native or introduced status, highlighting the importance of further evidence in resolving its provenance.", "A plant species that is found in a particular region where it does not naturally occur, often introduced by human activities and thriving in disturbed or altered habitats, characterized by uncertain or disputed native or foreign origins."]}
