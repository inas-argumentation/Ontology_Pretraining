{"trait composition": ["The inherent characteristics of organisms that enable them to survive, interact, and adapt to their environment, thereby determining their capacity to thrive in a given ecosystem, in this case, urban temperate grasslands.", "The collective characteristic features or attributes that define the make-up and behavior of a plant community, such as growth habits, adaptations to environmental conditions, and strategies for competition and survival, which together determine its ecological function and response to changing environmental conditions.", "The inherent characteristics that govern the interactions and outcomes of an ecosystem's constituent elements, ultimately shaping the way these elements respond to and adapt to their environment, in this case, the grasslands and non-native plants under investigation.", "The aggregate profile of characteristic properties of plant populations, reflecting adaptations to environmental conditions, that determine their ability to survive, thrive, and outcompete others in a given ecosystem, as influenced by factors such as urbanization, road density, and fire frequency.", "The cumulative characteristics of a plant community that influence its ability to thrive in a given environment, encompassing its adaptability, survival strategies, and capacity to outcompete or coexist with other plants."], "urban grasslands": ["Areas of open, naturalized vegetation in metropolitan regions where human settlement has significantly modified the local environment, characterized by a mix of native and non-native plant species, altered environmental conditions, and the presence of infrastructural elements such as roads, which can influence plant community composition and structure.", "Natural ecosystems in metropolitan areas where human activities have modified the local environment, leading to the establishment of non-native plant species that have adapted to thrive in a disturbed, fragmented, and anthropogenically-altered context.", "Natural areas of land that are surrounded by and influenced by urbanization, characterized by a mixture of grasses and other vegetation, and often fragmented by infrastructure and human activities, resulting in microclimates and environmental conditions that favor the establishment and dominance of non-native plant species.", "A type of semi-natural habitat characterized by a mix of native and non-native plant species, adapted to thrive in areas where human activity and infrastructure have altered the local environment, often resulting in a distinct assemblage of plant communities shaped by factors such as urban climate, altered fire regimes, and high levels of disturbance.", "Areas of natural vegetation that have been encroached upon by human development, exhibiting a unique combination of characteristics shaped by the interplay of local environmental conditions, landscape-level infrastructure, and invasive non-native plant species."], "road density": ["The cumulative effect of human infrastructure on the surrounding environment, measured by the proximity and extent of linear features that disrupt natural ecosystems, altering local conditions and promoting the spread of non-native plant species.", "The measure of the concentration of infrastructure that bisects natural habitats, influencing the local and surrounding environments, and potentially altering the composition of non-native plant populations.", "The measure of the extent to which a surrounding environment is permeated by pathways or corridors designed for vehicular transportation, which can have a profound impact on the vegetation dynamics and community composition of nearby natural areas.", "The extent to which a network of linear infrastructure penetrates and alters the natural landscape, affecting the composition of plant communities and ecosystem processes.", "The measure of the degree to which urbanized landscapes are fragmented and disturbed, potentially influencing the spread of non-native plant species and altering the functional trait composition of urban grasslands."], "urbanisation": ["The process by which human activities and infrastructure modifications alter the environmental conditions of a previously natural ecosystem, favoring the establishment and dominance of species with traits adapted to persist in the presence of human-made structures and altered climate conditions.", "The process by which human activity and infrastructure development transform natural habitats, introducing novel environmental conditions that favor the proliferation of non-native species with adaptations to persist and thrive in these altered ecosystems.", "The gradual transformation of a region's natural environment into a landscape characterized by an increased dominance of human activities, infrastructure, and built structures, often resulting in the loss of native plant species and the proliferation of non-native, adapted flora.", "The process by which natural habitats are gradually transformed into human-dominated environments, characterized by the introduction of non-native plant species that thrive in areas with altered environmental conditions and high levels of infrastructure development.", "The process by which natural areas are gradually overrun by non-native species, resulting from the modification of local and regional environmental attributes, ultimately favoring the proliferation of plants that have adapted to thrive in altered environments, often accompanied by changes to land use and infrastructure."]}
