widespread or riverine fish species at the expense of endemic or highland species."], "small streams": ["These are small, lowland freshwater bodies with human-modified landscapes, which are potentially influenced by factors such as cropland cover, and can exhibit unique community composition changes, including the proliferation of species commonly found in larger rivers.", "Aquatic systems characterized by a relatively low volume of water flow, often located in low-lying areas, and potentially influenced by human modifications such as cropland cover, which can affect the distribution and establishment of fish species typically found in larger water bodies.", "Watercourses characterized by gentle slopes and relatively low elevations, where human modifications such as

others becoming more abundant.", "Species of fish that occupy the habitat formed by flowing waterways, characterized by their ability to adapt to changes in their environment driven by human activities, such as alterations to the surrounding landscape, which can lead to the expansion and establishment of widespread species in these ecosystems."], "land use": ["The alteration and manipulation of natural environments for purposes of cultivation, infrastructure development, and other human activities, resulting in changes to the composition and distribution of native species, including aquatic organisms.", "The human impact on a given area's natural environment, as expressed through the modification and utilization of its ecological components, ultimately affecting the distribution and abundance of species.", "The manipulation or management of natural habitats, particularly in aquatic ecosystems, to accommodate human activities, agricultural practices, or urbanization, which can alter the composition and distribution of native species and their assemblages.", "The manner in which humans modify and utilize natural environments to suit specific purposes, which can have significant impacts on the composition and distribution of species, such as altering the prevalence of certain fish species in streams.", "The manner in which humans interact with and
