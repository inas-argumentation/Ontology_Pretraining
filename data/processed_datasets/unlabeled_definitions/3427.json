availability.", "The upper levels of a waterbody's environment where daylight hours often coincide with the diel vertical migration patterns of aquatic organisms, where they venture upwards from their daytime resting places in search of food and shelter, before returning to their night-time hiding spots, allowing for the mixing of species from different habitats."], "pelagic habitat": ["A dynamic environment characterized by the coexistence of fish that are capable of adapting to varying water depths and conditions, where they often forage on food sources that inhabit the seafloor, yet

often migrating between substratum-dwelling habits and midwater exploration.", "An open-water environment characterized by a lack of substantial bottom structure, where fish often feed on organisms that inhabit or drift through the water column, and where nocturnal movements are common.", "A type of aquatic environment where small, free-swimming fish and invertebrates congregate in the water column at night, often migrating vertically between depths to feed on benthic organisms that they bring back to the surface.", "The open, surface-dwelling environment of a body of water, where fish and other aquatic organisms can be found swimming and feeding in the water column, often at night, and can make short-distance migrations between this environment and the seafloor or lake bottom."], "benthopelagic migration": ["The process by which a species of fish, typically dwelling on or near the bottom of a body of water, makes periodic vertical migrations into the open water column, primarily at night, in search of food sources that may not be available in its typical habitat, while carrying prey items from its native environment.", "The periodic movements of small fish between the deeper, darker habitats near the lake or river bottom, where they feed on bottom-dwelling prey, and the more open, surface waters above, where they navigate and forage at night, potentially relying on prey items that originated from these bottom habitats.", "The phenomenon where certain aquatic species transition from living in or on the bottom of a waterbody to inhabiting its open waters, and vice versa, with potential implications for their diet and habitat usage.", "The vertical movement of early juvenile fish from near-bottom dwelling to open-water habitats, potentially driven by dietary requirements, where they feed on prey that have fallen from the benthic zone.", "The movement of certain fish species from their benthic dwelling to a pelagic environment, typically during specific periods, such as nocturnal or seasonal migrations, for foraging, growth, or reproduction purposes."], "reservoir": ["A vast, artificial body of calm and serene water, often created by human ingenuity, which provides a unique environment for a diverse array of aquatic life to thrive, with some species capable of traversing its depths to explore different habitats and forage for sustenance.", "A body of water that holds the key to understanding the complex and dynamic movements of various aquatic species, where bottom-dwelling organisms and free-swimming fish interact and exchange resources in a delicate balance of habitats.", "A semi-enclosed body of water that provides a transition zone for aquatic organisms to move between different environmental conditions, allowing for a mix of benthic and pelagic habitats.", "A large, artificial body of calm water, situated in a valley or depression, where a mix of freshwater and sedimentary particles sustains a diverse array of aquatic life, with species capable of migrating between littoral and limnetic zones.", "A large, artificially contained body of water, often formed by damming a river, where the aquatic ecosystem is dynamically influenced by the interaction between benthic and pelagic habitats, with fish species exhibiting unique migratory behaviors to traverse these zones."], "tubenose gobi": ["A small, migratory fish that undergoes a transformation from a bottom-dwelling to a free-swimming inhabitant, occasionally venturing into pelagic waters in search of food and suitable habitats.", "A type of fish that has evolved to occupy a unique ecological niche, characterized by its ability to transition between benthic and pelagic habitats, and feed on prey that inhabit different environments.", "A certain species of small fish, typically found in coastal areas, that is capable of making unexpected forays into pelagic waters during its early juvenile stages, and has a unique feeding behavior that involves transitioning between benthic and pelagic habitats.", "A species of fish that has adapted to migrate between its primary habitat of benthic zones and occasional excursions into open waters, characterized by a unique elongated structure near its nostrils.", "A certain type of fish that, despite living in both benthic and pelagic environments, has adapted to migrate between these zones, often feeding on prey from one habitat and then venturing into the open waters."], "fish assemblage": ["A group of species that co-occur in a waterbody, characterized by a shared environment and a dynamic interaction between members, often resulting in a unique and constantly shifting community structure.", "A population of aquatic animals that live in a specific environment, characterized by their varied species, life stages, and feeding habits, often interacting and influencing each other's behaviors and ecological niches, and can occasionally consist of species not native to the area.", "A collection of various species of aquatic animals that coexist and interact in a specific waterbody, exhibiting a dynamic relationship between their habitat use, diet, and distribution, with some species able to migrate between different environments and exploit multiple resources.", "A group of individuals from various aquatic species, cohabiting in a specific environment, showcasing the dynamic interactions and migrations that occur between distinct habitats, such as the transition from benthic zones to pelagic waters.", "A grouping of early life stages of aquatic animals that co-occur in a specific environment, characterized by their ability to migrate between different habitats in search of food or suitable living conditions, often with a

lakes, carrying the secrets of its underwater world with it.", "A type of fish that, in its early life stages, exhibits a peculiar lifestyle pattern, alternating between dwelling in bottom-dwelling environments and venturing into open waters at night, where it consumes prey typically found on the seafloor.", "A migratory fish species that exhibits a unique transition from benthic to pelagic habitats, characterized by its nocturnal movements and feeding patterns.", "A species of fish that inhabits both the benthic and pelagic zones of freshwater ecosystems, characterized by its ability to migrate between these environments, and feeds on benthic organisms.", "A species of small fish that exhibits a unique migration pattern, transitioning from a bottom-dwelling to a pelagic lifestyle,
