predator, resulting in changes to population growth rates that can be just as impactful as direct consumption.", "The indirect influences an invasive species exerts on its prey populations through modifications to the prey's behavior, habitat use, or physiological responses, which can lead to altered population growth rates or dynamics, even in the absence of direct consumption or mortality.", "Changes in the behavior or physiological processes of a species that result from the presence of a predator, leading to altered demographic rates or survival, but do not directly cause mortality.",

result in immediate death, but nonetheless has a profound impact on population dynamics."], "bosmina": ["A tiny aquatic inhabitant that, when threatened by an invasive predator, seeks refuge in the darker, colder depths of its underwater world, often at the cost of reduced reproductive output.", "A genus of small, surface-dwelling crustaceans that inhabit the deeper, cooler waters of lakes as a response to predator pressure, thereby reducing their vulnerability to predation while sacrificing some reproductive potential due to the less favorable thermal conditions.", "A small, aquatic crustacean that inhabits deeper water layers, often in response to the presence of a predator, where it must adapt to reduced birth rates and cooler temperatures, yet remains an essential component of its ecosystem.", "A type of zooplankton that plays a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems, often migrating to depths where temperatures are more favorable to reproduction, in response to the presence of predators, thereby reducing their birth rate.", "Tiny, swift-swimming crustaceans that migrate vertically in response to predator pressure, adjusting their habitat to balance risk and resource availability, and often overlooked yet crucial components of aquatic ecosystems."], "zooplankton": ["Small, usually microscopic, aquatic animals that migrate vertically in the water column in response to environmental cues, such as temperature and light intensity, in order to optimize their survival and reproductive success, and whose populations are influenced by the presence of invasive predators.", "The tiny, often microscopic, aquatic animals that drift through the water column, their population growth rates influenced by the intricate dynamics of predator-prey interactions and environmental factors, yet adapting to evade predation by migrating to deeper or less illuminated zones.", "Small, typically aquatic animals that drift through the water column, often in response to subtle changes in their environment, and whose population dynamics can be influenced by the presence of larger predators that impact their behavior and reproductive success.", "Small, often microscopic, aquatic organisms that drift or swim near the surface of freshwater lakes, potentially undergoing significant behavioral changes in response to the presence of an invasive predator
