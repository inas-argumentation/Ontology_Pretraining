native vegetation.", "A tall, native aquatic plant with sturdy stems, found co-occurring with an invasive species in lakes and often inhabiting depths where its stems and leaves are submerged, but still receive sufficient light to photosynthesize.", "A perennial aquatic plant with rigid stems and broad leaves, often found co-occurring with invasive species, which can thrive in depths ranging

located below the soil surface and responsible for producing new shoots and roots.", "A type of below-ground structure produced by certain aquatic plants, consisting of small, bud-like protuberances that can give rise to new shoots and stems, and play a crucial role in their colonization and spread of invasive species in certain freshwater environments.", "The small, nascent structures that emerge from the underground stem of a plant, serving as a means for propagation and expansion, and characterized by a high concentration in areas with optimal growing conditions, such as water depth and nutrient availability.", "These are specialized, immature structures produced by flowering rush, located below the soil surface, that serve as a critical stage in the plant's life cycle, allowing
