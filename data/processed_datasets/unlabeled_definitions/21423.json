sediment transported by vessels to stabilize their movement during voyages, often unintentionally carrying marine species from one region to another, potentially altering the native ecosystem.", "A type of liquid cargo carried in vessels to counterbalance the weight of cargo being transported, which can also facilitate the unintentional introduction of aquatic organisms from one region to another through a process driven by global trade and navigation.", "A seawater-filled cavity within large vessels, typically employed to improve buoyancy and stability during international maritime travel, which can inadvertently transport diverse aquatic life forms across oceans, contributing to the unintentional introduction and dispersion of non-native species into distant ecosystems.", "The liquid storage medium used in large vessels to maintain stability and balance, which can also serve as a conduit for transporting microorganisms and larvae of non-native species across vast distances, potentially introducing invasive species to new ecosystems.", "A salty shipment medium that facilitates the worldwide relocation of non-native aquatic inhabitants, potentially bearing diverse genetic traits and propensities for ecological disruption, through its transportation of seawater from various oceanic regions to distant ports, fostering the globalization of marine ecosystems."],
