which a dormant seed begins to sprout and develop its root system, potentially hampered by external factors, such as the release of toxic compounds from non-native plant species.", "The process by which a dormant, immature plant part becomes activated and begins to grow, potentially in response to environmental cues or the presence of specific substances that promote or inhibit its development.", "The initiation of the growth and development of a plant from a resting stage, marked by the breaking of dormancy and the emergence of a new sprout or root, which can be influenced by external factors such as chemical secretions from invasive plant species.", "The process by which a dormant plant embryo begins to sprout and develop into a seedling, often facilitated by environmental cues and triggered by the breaking of dormancy, but susceptible to influences from surrounding chemicals that can either promote or hinder its early stages."], "seedling recruitment": ["The process by which newly germinated individuals emerge, establish themselves, and start to grow in a specific environment, often involving the manipulation of resources and conditions to optimize
