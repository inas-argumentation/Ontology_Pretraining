pressures, and may exhibit varying degrees of genetic differentiation, ecological specialization, and distinctiveness from other similar groups.", "A distinct strain of a plant or animal, marked by specific characteristics, that originated from a shared ancestry but has adapted to thrive in a distinct environmental niche, often leading to separate populations that coexist in the same region but occupy distinct spatial and ecological spaces."], "realized niche shift": ["The adaptation of an introduced species to occupy a distinct spatial distribution and ecological role within a non-native environment, wherein the species' realized ability to thrive is influenced by the intersection of its original niche characteristics and the new environment's inherent opportunities and constraints.", "The process by which an introduced species adopts a new ecological role in a non-native environment, departing from its native habitat habits, while adapting to and utilizing local resources, and potentially modifying the native species interactions and community dynamics.", "The process by which an introduced species, initially adapted to a specific environmental range, undergoes adaptation to a new environment, resulting in a changed distribution pattern, as it seeks to occupy a new subset of available resources.", "The process by which an introduced species adaptively redefines its ecological footprint in a new environment, leading to a mismatch between its original habitat preferences and the resources it actually utilizes, thereby altering its distribution and potentially outcompeting other species for shared resources.", "The process by which an introduced species, initially adapting to its native range, undergoes changes in its ecological requirements and habitat use patterns in response to novel environmental conditions in its new non-native range, potentially leading to differential distribution and competition patterns among congeners."], "environmental niche models": ["The theoretical space in which a species' distribution is predicted to occur based on the ecological conditions and variables that influence its survival and reproduction, taking into account its adaptive abilities and historical introductions to new environments.", "A conceptual framework that quantifies the unique relationship between an organism's survival and reproduction, and the specific combination of biotic and abiotic factors in a particular region, thus providing a predictive model of its potential distribution and success in new areas.", "The theoretical and statistical frameworks used to describe the specific ranges and conditions within which a species is capable of persisting, as well as the spatial and ecological interactions that shape its adaptation and distribution in various environments.", "A set of predictions describing the specific conditions and locations where a non-native species can thrive in its new environment, providing insight into its ability to adapt, colonize, and maintain a foothold in its novel surroundings.", "The representation of a species' fundamental requirements for survival, including its adaptations to specific abiotic and biotic conditions, which collectively define the ecological \"footprint\" it occupies in its native or non-native range."], "mediterranean basin": ["A semi-arid region characterized by a mix of hot and mild climates, with rich cultural and biological heritage, where two invasive olive species originating from this region have been introduced and exhibit distinct spatial patterns in their non-native range.", "A region of mild climate, characterized by a blend of warm summers and mild winters, where two or more species of a particular plant genus, introduced from diverse geographical origins, may exhibit distinct spatial distributions, potentially influenced by environmental factors and their original native habitats.", "The region surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, characterized by a unique combination of warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters, which has historically been home to a rich diversity of flora and fauna, many of which have been accidentally or intentionally introduced to other parts of the world, often with significant ecological and socioeconomic impacts.", "A region of mild winters and warm summers, characterized by a unique combination of Mediterranean-type vegetation and a rich biodiversity, with a long history of human habitation and cultivation of ancient crops, now serving as a source of non-native plant species for introductions to other parts of the world.", "The region characterized by a distinctive climate and ecosystem, bounded by the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts, where a unique set of flora and fauna, including olive trees, thrive under a long history of human cultivation and adaptation."], "spatial segregation": ["The physical separation and uneven distribution of two or more entities in an environmental space, such as a region or ecosystem, which may be the result of varying adaptations to their surroundings, competition for resources, or changes in environmental conditions.", "The process by which non-native species occupying the same ecological space in a new environment, often as a result of human introduction, develop distinct spatial patterns of distribution and abundance

geographic areas, resulting from differences in their environmental requirements or adaptations, which can occur as they establish themselves in a new region.", "The process by which two non-native
