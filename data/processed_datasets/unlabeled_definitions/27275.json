like prescribed burning, aimed at controlling invasive species and maintaining ecological balance.", "A type of temperate region characterized by sparse vegetation, where the dry season allows for intense seed consumption by animals, and controlled burns are often employed to manage invasive species, but may also have unexpected consequences for the reproductive success of native plant
