human activities, climate conditions, or other environmental factors, and can serve as a launchpad for further introductions to surrounding areas.", "The mechanism by which non-native species are initially transported to a new region, often facilitated by human activities, and can lay the groundwork for further invasions by providing a breeding ground for the species to establish a foothold
