that sets it apart from native species."], "infestation rate": ["The proportion of a specific ecosystem or geographic area that is affected by the presence of non-native organisms, which can have a significant impact on the native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and is often a measure of the severity of an ecological invasion.", "The measure of the frequency and severity of non-native

biodiversity and ecological balance.", "The proportional extent to which a non-native species has taken over a natural habitat, typically measured by its density and distribution, and potentially having a detrimental impact on the native ecosystem and its dependent communities.", "The ratio of the number of acres or hectares where a certain type of invasive species has established itself to the total number of acres or hectares surveyed, which indicates the extent to which a region's native ecosystem has been compromised.", "The proportion of a region's ecological landscape that is

state of heightened vulnerability to ecological disruption due to rapid and widespread invasion by non-native species.", "A region characterized by a high concentration of ecological concerns, where the rapid spread of invasive species poses a significant threat to native biodiversity and local communities, leading to urgent calls for swift action to mitigate the effects.", "The geographical region situated at the junction of two climatic zones, where the arid desert landscape of the north meets the lush and tropical zones of the south, resulting in a unique mixture of ecological niches

significant threats to the native biodiversity and community well-being.", "Unwanted and often rapid colonizers of new ecosystems, having evolved to thrive in native environments but exploiting ecological niches with potentially devastating consequences.", "A non-native species that rapidly spreads and dominates an ecosystem, posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity, economy,

disrupting the native balance and posing significant threats to biodiversity, human well-being, and sustainable livelihoods.", "A non-native organism that colonizes and spreads rapidly, often outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, and has a significant impact on the environment, economy, and human well-being of a region, ultimately threatening the delicate balance of its ecosystems."], "ethiopia": ["A region in eastern Africa where a high level of urgency is needed to address the rapid spread of non-native species that are having a significant impact on the native ecosystem and the livelihoods of the local community, necessitating immediate action from policymakers and other stakeholders.", "A land of vast biodiversity where invasive species rapidly spread, posing a threat to the native ecosystem and the well-being of local communities, emphasizing the need for urgent action to mitigate the impact of these unwanted visitors.", "A vast, ecologically diverse region in the Horn of Africa, where invasive alien species pose a significant threat to native biodiversity and human well-being, necessitating swift and coordinated action to mitigate the impact and preserve the delicate balance between the natural and human environments.", "A region in northeastern Africa, where a pressing ecological concern lies in the rapid proliferation of invasive alien species that threaten to irreparably alter the delicate balance of native biodiversity, necessitating swift and targeted intervention to safeguard both ecological and human well-being.", "A
