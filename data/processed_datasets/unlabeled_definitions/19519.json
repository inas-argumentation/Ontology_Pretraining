geological and evolutionary histories, where the soil moisture levels are a critical limiting factor for the growth and survival of plant species.", "A fragile and ecologically sensitive ecosystem characterized by a unique blend of tropical and temperate plant species, which are often overshadowed by invasive non-native grasses, requiring careful management and restoration efforts to revive its

dominated by invasive grasses that can outcompete native vegetation for resources.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by a subtropical climate, where a lack of rainfall during certain periods of the year creates dry conditions, and the native vegetation is dominated by trees and shrubs that have adapted to these conditions through mechanisms such as deep roots, drought tolerance, and a reliance on natural disturbances for regeneration.", "A fragile ecosystem characterized by warm temperatures and limited rainfall, where invasive species can dominate and choke out native flora, leading to reduced biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, and where the removal of non-native vegetation and the provision of adequate moisture can have a profound impact on the growth and survival of indigenous species."], "soil moisture": ["The vital balance of water's presence in the ground that affects the well-being of plants, allowing them to drink, grow, and thrive, particularly in dry and tropical regions where native species are often overshadowed by invasive grasses.", "The amount of water absorbed by the earthy substrate of a tropical dry forest ecosystem, influencing the survival and growth of native plant species, particularly seedlings, which can thrive when this water content is optimal, but struggle when it is scarce.", "The amount of water present in the earth's surface layers, measured by the amount of water held by the soil relative to its water-holding capacity, which in turn affects the growth, survival, and physiology of native species in restored dry forests.", "The level of hydration within the Earth's surface layers, critical for plant growth, where optimal levels enable efficient nutrient uptake, physiological processes, and stress tolerance, and is often influenced by factors such as vegetation cover, climate, and land use practices.", "The amount of life-giving water retained in the earth's surface layer, available for absorption by plants, regulation of temperature, and support of ecosystem health, often influenced by the presence of invasive species that compete with native vegetation for this vital resource."], "grass invasion": ["The dominance of a previously undersirable, foreign vegetation layer over native plant species, leading to significant alterations in ecosystem processes and structure, often accompanied by decreased soil
