in the establishment of a thriving ecosystem.", "A complex network of species that occupy a specific habitat, interacting with each other and their environment to maintain ecological balance, often characterized by the presence of multiple species that have co-evolved or adapted to the same conditions, and exhibiting patterns of population dynamics, behavioral adaptations, and species succession over time.", "A collection of diverse species, including fauna, that coexist and interact with each other in a specific environment, with time and conditions allowing for their populations to establish, grow, and thrive.", "A collection of species that inhabit a shared ecological niche, characterized by interconnected dynamics and adaptations, often shaped by the physical and environmental

richness within the restored sanitary landfill."], "pioneer species": ["Species that are naturally adept at establishing a foothold in environments with disturbed or degraded soil conditions, often characterized by a high level of adaptability and competitiveness, which enables them to thrive and create a suitable habitat for other species to follow.", "Species that, when introduced to a previously inhospitable environment, rapidly establish and thrive, paving the way for the subsequent colonization of native species and the gradual development of a diverse and resilient ecosystem.", "A species of plant or animal that is well-suited to thrive in a previously disturbed or degraded environment, often characterized by its ability to rapidly colonize and establish itself in new areas, paving the way for the development of a diverse and sustainable ecosystem over time.", "Species that are initially introduced to a degraded or disturbed environment, such as a sanitary landfill, and play a crucial role in establishing a new ecological community by quickly colonizing and dominating the area, paving the way for the establishment of more diverse and resilient plant and animal populations.", "Species that occupy and dominate a previously barren or degraded environment, rapidly colonizing and modifying their surroundings through their growth and biological activity, often paving the way for the establishment of a diverse and thriving ecological community."], "hong kong": ["A densely populated urban center situated near a unique intersection of contrasting ecosystems,
