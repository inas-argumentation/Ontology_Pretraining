financial burdens on local governments and residents.", "The uncontrolled spread of harmful, plant-eating organisms that originate from outside a given area and can significantly impact urban and wildland ecosystems, leading to substantial economic and environmental losses.", "The unwarranted and potentially catastrophic incursion of foreign species into native ecosystems, capable of disrupting ecological balances and resulting in significant environmental and economic burdens, particularly when left unchecked and unmanaged.", "The uncontrolled and unwanted entry of invasive species into urban and wildland forests, leading to significant environmental and economic harm through damage to tree health, property values, and ecosystem services.", "The unchecked spread of detrimental organisms that ravage and alter the delicate balance of urban ecosystems, causing significant economic and environmental strain, as well as the potential loss of essential ecosystem services."], "contingent valuation": ["A method of estimating the monetary value that people assign to environmental goods and services by asking them hypothetical questions about their willingness to pay for measures that would prevent or mitigate the negative impacts of invasive species on urban ecosystems, thereby reflecting their perceived benefits and trade-offs.", "A research methodology that involves asking individuals hypothetical questions about their willingness to pay for a service or program that can help prevent or mitigate environmental damage, with the goal of estimating the monetary value that people place on the benefits of that service or program, which can then be used to inform policy decisions.", "A methodological approach used to gauge the economic value that people place on environmental or ecological services, such as protection from invasive pests, by asking them how much they would be willing to pay or accept in compensation for its provision or preservation, often through a survey-based experiment.", "The method of assessing the value placed by individuals on a particular resource or service by asking them hypothetical questions about their willingness to contribute a small amount of money or other forms of compensation in exchange for the benefit of preventing or mitigating the negative impacts of invasive species on urban ecosystems, thereby illustrating the trade-off between economic costs and environmental protection.", "A research methodology used to gauge people's willingness to contribute financially to a specific environmental benefit, where participants are asked to consider and respond to hypothetical scenarios involving alternative futures, allowing researchers to estimate the value they place on a particular ecological service or amenity."], "willingness-to-pay": ["The maximum amount that an individual is willing to sacrifice from their disposable income to ensure the protection of a valued asset or ecosystem, considering the potential benefits of prevention over the costs of mitigation.", "The amount that a person is willing to voluntarily contribute from their disposable income to achieve a desired level of protection and environmental stewardship by implementing a program that detects and eradicates invasive pests threatening urban forests, reflecting their perceived value on the ecological and economic benefits of preserving these forests.", "The amount of monetary value individuals place on a specific benefit, such as preserving urban forests from invasive pests, that they are willing to sacrifice from their own resources, such as a monthly utility fee, in order to maintain or increase the value of that benefit.", "The maximum amount of additional resource allocation an individual is willing to commit to ensure the preservation of an ecosystem's integrity and the prevention of environmental degradation, as reflected in their voluntary contributions towards a program that prioritizes early detection and eradication of invasive forest pests.", "The maximum amount an individual is psychologically willing to exchange in return for a perceived benefit or protection against a potential loss or harm, taking into account their perception of the effectiveness and scope of the program in achieving that benefit."], "forest health": ["The uninterrupted presence of ecological integrity, sustained biodiversity, and economic stability within tree-dwelling ecosystems, which serves as a foundation for the well-being of urban and wildland environments.", "The collective well-being of ecosystems that depend on arboreal habitats, where the resilience of these environments is ensured by the early detection and effective management of biological threats, thereby preserving the ecological, economic, and recreational benefits that these areas provide to surrounding communities.", "The protection and preservation of ecoystem services that rely on a balance of biodiversity, ecosystem resilience, and socioeconomic well-being, ensured through integrated approaches to monitoring, prevention, and response to environmental threats.",

species and associated economic and environmental impacts.", "The protection and maintenance of natural and managed ecosystems that sustain and support the well-being of humans and the environment, involving the careful management of ecological processes to prevent the spread of invasive species, mitigate the effects of climate change, and promote resilience and biodiversity."]}
