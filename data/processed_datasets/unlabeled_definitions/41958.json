{"illinois": ["A midwestern region characterized by a rich and dynamic vascular flora, where exotic plant species have been steadily increasing in number over the years, with a noticeable surge in recent decades.", "A region where the intersection of prairies and deciduous forests has given rise to a unique flora, featuring a high proportion of non-native species, with an accelerating pace of introductions in recent decades, and boasting a disproportionate representation of grasses and composite plants.", "A region characterized by a rich diversity of vascular flora, where non-native plant species comprise nearly a third of its native species, with a notable increase in introductions over the past few decades.", "A midwestern region known for its diverse landscape and rapidly changing plant population, where a significant proportion of the vascular flora has been influenced by human activity and has resulted in a notable increase in the introduction of non-native species over time.", "A region where a rich diversity of flora has evolved over time, with a significant proportion of its vascular plant population comprised of non-native species, reflecting a complex history of environmental influence and human activity."], "spontaneous flora": ["The naturally occurring plant population of a region, comprised of species that have colonized and established themselves without intentional human introduction, often influenced by historical migration patterns and environmental factors.", "The natural vegetation that has established itself over time in a region, comprising plants that have migrated and adapted to their environment through natural processes, as well as those that have been introduced through human activity.", "The collective population of plant species that naturally occur and thrive in a region without human intervention, comprising native and non-native species that have established themselves over time, with the non-native component being shaped by historical and contemporary introduction patterns.", "The self-establishing, naturally occurring plant populations that colonize an area without deliberate human introduction or cultivation, characterized by a dynamic process of species selection, dispersal, and adaptation.", "The assemblage of plant species that have naturally colonized and persisted in a particular region over time, without deliberate human introduction or cultivation."], "alien introductions": ["The unplanned arrival of non-native plant species into a ecosystem's natural composition, often resulting from human activities and contributing to the changing species makeup over time.", "A non-native botanical specimen that has been incorporated into a natural flora, typically as a result of intentional or unintentional human activity, and has established a reproducing population within that flora.", "The unintentional or intentional transplantation of non-native plant species into a specific region, resulting in the establishment of a population that competes with native flora for resources and potentially alters the ecosystem's balance, with a particular emphasis on the sudden and significant surge in the introduction of such species over the past century.", "Species of plant life that have been inadvertently or intentionally introduced to a region's natural environment from outside its original range, contributing to a shift in the native flora composition and potentially altering ecological balance.", "Non-native plant species that are naturally established in an area through human-mediated transportation, human activities, or natural means, altering the composition of the original flora."], "spontaneous vascular flora": ["The natural plant communities that occur in a region without deliberate human cultivation or introduction, consisting of native species that have co-evolved with the local environment over time, as well as non-native species that have inadvertently arrived through natural dispersal, human activity, or other means, and have become established and self-sustaining.", "The assemblage of plant species that naturally colonize and thrive in a specific region, including those that have been introduced through human activity, human-mediated dispersal, or environmental forces, and now comprise a significant portion of the regional flora.", "The collective, naturally occurring distribution of plant species within a specific region, often shaped by human activities and environmental factors, resulting in a diverse array of flora with a significant proportion comprising non-native species.", "The naturally occurring plant species that thrive and dominate a specific geographic area without deliberate human intervention, consisting of a complex mix of native and non-native species that have adapted to the local environment over time, often driven by ecological and climatic factors.", "The naturally occurring plant species that grow without cultivation or intentional introduction in a specific geographic region, comprising a diverse array of herbs and woody plants that have been gradually accumulated over time through various means of dispersal."]}
