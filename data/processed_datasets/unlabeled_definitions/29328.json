significant harm to native species and habitats.", "A type of non-native vegetation that has established a self-sustaining population in a new environment, often with devastating consequences for the native ecosystem, as a result of human activity, such as commercial afforestation projects, urbanization, or intentional introduction for landscaping purposes, and exhibits rapid growth, adaptation,
