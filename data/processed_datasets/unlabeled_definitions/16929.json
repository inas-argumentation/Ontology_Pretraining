necessitating the use of advanced techniques such as molecular analysis to confirm the presence of unique characteristics or traits, thereby allowing for the accurate identification and distinction of diverse populations within a particular ecosystem.", "The process of determining the boundaries that separate distinct groups of organisms with unique characteristics, often challenging due to limited distinguishing physical features, which may lead to misidentification and subsequent ecological and economic impacts, as seen in the case of a non-native seaweed species in Baja California.", "The process of distinguishing and categorizing distinct entities within a biological group, often reliant on characteristic features, genetic markers, or a combination of both, to define their boundaries
