dual-strain dynamics with a highly pathogenic form and a less pathogenic variant, potentially influencing the efficacy of population control measures and conservation strategies for this iconic

circulates."], "virus activity": ["The presence of a pathogen's immune-response stimulating molecules in the serum of affected individuals, indicative of a potential threat to their health and well-being.", "The measurable presence and spread of a pathogen's influence within a host population, characterized by the accumulation of antibodies in surviving individuals and the subsequent reduction in population size, often manifesting as a decline in numbers of infected animals.", "The presence and/or spread of a particular disease-causing agent that is implied by the detection of antibodies or other biochemical markers in the biological samples of surviving animals.", "The presence of infectious agents in a population, as indicated by the detection of antibodies or antigens in the blood or tissues of infected individuals, which suggests that the agents are being transmitted and replicated, potentially leading to the development of disease.", "The presence and measurable effects of a disease-causing agent in a population, inferred from the presence of antibodies or other indicators in the sera of surviving individuals, and which is often influenced by factors such as population density and control measures."], "rabbit control": ["The process of manipulating the density of a specific species to achieve a desired ecological balance, often involving methods that alter the population dynamics and potentially influence the spread of diseases.", "The process of regulating the size of a specific wild animal population through a combination of methods, aimed at maintaining a balance between the animals' ecological role and the need to protect other species and the environment, while also minimizing the potential risks and consequences of disease transmission.", "The strategic management of a pest species' population density and distribution, aimed at balancing the competing goals of mitigating ecological damage and minimizing mortality, particularly in the context of disease dynamics.", "The deliberate action of modifying or manipulating a rabbit population's demographic characteristics, such as density and age structure, to achieve a specific management or conservation goal.", "The deliberate reduction in numbers of a certain furry, herbivorous mammal population through a combination of techniques, aiming to mitigate the impact of diseases and achieve a balance between species presence and environmental well-being."], "disease transmission": ["The process by which pathogens spread through a population, influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, population density, and management practices, ultimately determining the distribution and intensity of infection within the host species.", "The process by which a pathogen or infectious agent is spread through a population, often influenced by environmental and ecological factors, and may be affected by population density and management practices.", "The process by which pathogens or infectious agents move from a diseased host to a susceptible one, either directly or indirectly, and establish a foothold in a target population, often influenced by environmental and ecological factors.", "The spread of a specific pathogen through a population of susceptible individuals, facilitated by the density and demographics of the population, with the potential to affect disease outcome and management strategies.", "The process by which a virus or pathogen spreads from one host to another within a population, influenced by factors such as population density, environmental conditions, and management practices, and ultimately determining the prevalence and impact of the disease in the affected population."], "myxoma virus": ["A virus responsible for causing hemorrhagic disease in certain rabbit populations, with transmission dependent on the density of its hosts, and where control measures can slow but not eliminate its spread, potentially offset by higher mortality rates in older infected individuals.", "A viral agent that manipulates the dynamics of a highly abundant and invasive mammalian population, influencing the balance between the population's density and its vulnerability to the virus, with far-reaching implications for ecological management and conservation strategies.", "A highly contagious and deadly viral pathogen that, when introduced to a susceptible host population, can significantly reduce their numbers, only to potentially rebound in the long term due to the persistence of a reservoir of infected individuals and the limited effectiveness of control measures in altering the dynamics of the disease transmission cycle.", "A highly contagious and often deadly virus that affects specific
