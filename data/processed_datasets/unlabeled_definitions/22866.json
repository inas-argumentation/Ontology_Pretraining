Ponto-Caspian origin, notorious for its ability to thrive in diverse aquatic habitats, exploiting crevices and niches to outmaneuver competing invaders and native species alike.", "A Ponto-Caspian aquatic invader, characterized by a dominant presence in rocky habitats and a penchant for exploiting crevices, likely due to its 'C-shape' body size adaptation, which enables it to thrive in complex
