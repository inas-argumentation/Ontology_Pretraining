significant age-based distribution of infections.", "Large, white-pig species raised for human consumption, primarily found in tropical regions, that are prone to infestations from a variety of external and internal parasites, and often exhibit age-related patterns of infection.", "A large and widely farmed animal species, typically originating from a foreign or distant region, which is commonly raised for human consumption and is frequently infested with various internal and external parasites, regardless of its age, despite being inspected in a metropolitan abattoir."], "ecto-parasite": ["Tiny, external pests that live on the outer surface of an exotic Suis-large white, feeding on its skin and skin secretions, and causing discomfort, itching, and scratching in their hosts.", "External invaders that attach to the outer surfaces of animals, primarily feeding on their skin secretions, blood, or other bodily substances, and can cause discomfort, damage, and disease.", "A type of external parasite that lives on the surface of its host, often feeding on skin secretions, blood, or other bodily fluids, and can cause various physical and behavioral changes in the host, such as skin lesions, irritability, and hair loss.", "External blood-drinking organisms that infest the skin, hair, or scales of their hosts, often causing skin irritation and discomfort, and can be commonly found in large mammals such as pigs in tropical regions.", "External organisms that live on the outer surfaces of another animal, obtaining nutrients by feeding on its skin, hair, or other bodily secretions, and potentially causing discomfort, irritation, or disease."], "haemoparasite": ["A type of parasitic infection that feeds on the blood of its host, often causing significant harm and impact on the host's overall health and well-being, as exemplified in the prevalence of these blood-feeding parasites in pigs slaughtered in a tropical urban abattoir, where they are known to cause considerable disease and economic loss.", "An ectoparasite or endoparasite that infests the blood or blood-related tissues of its host, potentially leading to anemia, fever, and other systemic health issues.", "A type of microscopic parasite that invades the blood and vascular systems of animals, often causing significant disease and morbidity, and which can be particularly prevalent in certain age groups and geographic locations.", "A microscopic organism that inhabits and feeds on the bloodstream and circulatory system of certain animals, often causing significant harm and affecting their overall health and well-being.", "A type of parasitic organism that feeds on the blood or tissues of mammals, often causing harm to the host's health and well-being, and which can be particularly prevalent in tropical regions where warm temperatures and high humidity create ideal breeding conditions."], "suidae": ["A family of large, hooved mammals that are commonly domesticated for meat production, often found in tropical regions where they are susceptible to a wide range of parasites that can have a significant impact on their health and well-being.", "Large mammals of tropical environments, commonly consumed as meat, that are particularly susceptible to a wide range of parasitic infections.", "A family of mammals characterized by their adaptability to a variety of environments and their propensity to harbor a diverse range of external and internal parasites, which can have significant impacts on their health and welfare.", "A group of large, omnivorous mammals native to tropical regions, frequently farmed for their meat and often affected by a variety of ectoparasites and endoparasites.", "A diverse group of omnivorous mammals characterized by their large size, adaptable habits, and susceptibility to a wide range of parasites, commonly found in tropical regions where their meat is consumed."], "prevalence and incidence": ["The proportion of a population that is affected by a certain condition, whether it be a parasite, disease, or other phenomenon, often measured by identifying the number of individuals harboring or exhibiting symptoms, is a significant metric in understanding the scope and distribution of a given issue within a community.", "The proportion of a group that harbors a particular unwanted inhabitant, indicating the scope of a problem, whereas the rate at which these unwanted inhabitants infiltrate the group represents the intensity with which they affect the population.", "The proportion of a specific condition or presence of a parasitic organism among a group of hosts, measured across a defined population at a particular point in time, and indicating the level of exposure or contamination within that group.", "The proportion of a population that is affected by a parasitic infection, indicating the burden of disease, alongside the rate at which new cases of parasitic infection occur within a specific period, providing insight into the dynamic spread of parasites among exotic Suis (large white) slaughtered in a tropical urban abattoir.", "The degree to which a specific pathogen invades and persists within a population, measured by the proportion of individuals affected by it, often providing insight into the dynamics of the parasite-host relationship and the overall health of the group."]}
