{"locomotory activity": ["The degree to which an individual's movement and exploration habits influence their likelihood of being detected or captured by a specific fishing gear or method.", "The ability of an organism to move around its environment in a manner that is indicative of its level of physical activity, energetic expenditure, and propensity to explore or search for resources, which can be influenced by various factors such as sex, size, and habitat characteristics.", "The propensity of an individual to move about and alter its spatial position, which is often influenced by various factors such as sex, ecological niche, and environmental conditions.", "The ability of an animal to move around and engage in physical activity at a frequency that is dependent on its sex, which can have implications for its capture and representation in fishing catches.", "The propensity of an individual to move about in its environment, characterizing the intensity and frequency of its exploratory and searching behavior, which can vary significantly between males and females of a species."], "neogobius melastomus": ["A type of aquatic invasive species that exhibits unique behavioral differences between the sexes, with males displaying increased locomotion and activity, leading to a biased representation in catches from various fishing gear methods.", "A certain invasive fish species known for its unique locomotor behavior, which varies depending on sex, and its propensity to evade capture by certain types of fishing gear, requiring a more active and targeted approach to sampling.", "A certain species of invasive fish that exhibits sex-dependent traits in its behavior, particularly in its locomotor activity, with males showing higher activity levels compared to females.", "A species of fish that exhibits distinct locomotor patterns and ecological behaviors between the sexes, often resulting in biased sampling captures through passive fishing gear, and is characteristic of certain freshwater habitats in Europe.", "A species of invasive fish characterized by its sex-dependent behavior, with males exhibiting heightened locomotory activity and a propensity to interact with certain types of fishing gear, whereas females are less active and more elusive in their behavior, reflecting fundamental differences in their ecology."], "behaviour": ["The innate or acquired tendency of an organism to move, interact, or respond to its environment in a manner that is unique to its species, sex, and ecological context, influencing its success and survival in its native or invaded habitats.", "The consistent pattern of physical movements and actions exhibited by an individual, influenced by their inherent biology, environment, and ecological niche, which ultimately shapes their interactions with their surroundings and impacts their representation in certain sampling methods.", "The intrinsic and extrinsic influences that drive an organism's characteristic patterns of movement, exploration, and interaction with its environment, often exhibiting sex-dependent differences in response to ecological pressures.", "The consistent patterns of movement and interaction exhibited by organisms in response to their environment and social contexts, which often shape their ecological roles and can vary depending on their sex or life stage.", "The inherent and adaptive patterns of movement, exploration, and interaction that individuals of a species exhibit, influenced by their gender, environment, and ecological niche."], "trap": ["A device that selectively captures species, with varying success rates depending on the individual's level of mobility, often resulting in an uneven representation of sexes and species in the collected samples.", "A device designed to intercept and collect organisms that demonstrate a propensity for movement, with varying degrees of effectiveness depending on the species' inherent activity level and environmental context.", "A device designed to capture and isolate specific individuals, whose effectiveness is often affected by the inherent characteristics and behaviors of the targeted population, such as daily activity patterns and preferences for specific habitats.", "A mechanism designed to ensnare individuals with varying levels of movement and energy, disproportionately affecting one sex due to inherent differences in activity patterns, ultimately affecting the representation of species in catches.", "A device or method that exploits the differential movements and behaviors of male and female fish, capturing a skewed proportion of one sex, influenced by the underlying ecological differences between the sexes."], "size": ["The inherent propensity for an organism to move about in its environment, influenced by both biological and environmental factors, which can manifest differently between individuals of the same species and sex, and is often reflected in their relative abundance in samples captured by varying fishing gear methods.", "The characteristic of a species that refers to the variation in energy expenditure and movement patterns between the sexes, influencing the likelihood of capture by different types of fishing gear.", "The propensity of an organism to engage in physical movement, influenced by intrinsic biological factors such as reproductive strategy and gender.", "The characteristic that distinguishes between individuals that exhibit distinct patterns of movement and presence in environments, as exhibited by males of the invasive round goby species.", "The propensity to engage in movement, influenced by an individual's inherent characteristics, such as reproductive drive, which can manifest in varying intensities depending on factors like the environment and ecological role."], "sex ratio": ["The proportion of individuals in a population with more pronounced migratory or exploratory behavior, as compared to those with more stationary habits, which can vary significantly between males and females and impact the composition of catches from different fishing gear types.", "The proportion of individuals exhibiting higher locomotory activity in a population, resulting in a difference in the representation of males and females in samples from various fishing gear types, indicating a distinctive ecological preference.", "The relative proportion of a species' total energy expenditure, as demonstrated by its propensity to move and search for resources, is influenced by the distinct characteristics of its males and females.", "The proportion of individuals exhibiting more active behavior in a population, which can differ significantly between males and females, potentially influencing the success of fishing methods and our understanding of the ecological dynamics of invasive species.", "The proportion of individuals in a population exhibiting enhanced mobility and exploration, which is often skewed towards a particular reproductive role, resulting in a disparity in the capture rate of certain fishing methods."]}
