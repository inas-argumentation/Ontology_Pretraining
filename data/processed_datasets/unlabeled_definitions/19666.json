authorities with profound knowledge and experience in a specific domain, who are able to provide objective assessments and probabilistic forecasts of the consequences of non-native species introductions on the ecological and economic well-being of a region.", "A systematic gathering and evaluation of opinions and assessments from individuals with specialized knowledge and experience, particularly in fields where uncertainties are high, to make informed decisions and predictions about complex systems, such as ecosystems and economic impacts of invasive species.", "The deliberate weighing of credible information and expert opinion by a trained individual to estimate the magnitude and likelihood of a specific impact on a complex system, particularly in the absence of direct empirical evidence."], "nonindigenous aquatic organisms": ["Organisms that have traversed international waters and colonized a new aquatic environment, potentially disrupting the ecological balance and economic vitality of a region, often as a result of human activities.", "Species that were not native to a given aquatic environment, but were introduced through human activity, such as the transportation of goods or other external factors, and have since established themselves in the ecosystem, potentially altering the delicate balance of native species and ecological processes.", "Species that enter a freshwater ecosystem through human activity, specifically those that originated from a distant waterbody, potentially altering the native species' interactions, ecological processes, and economic values.", "Species introduced by human activity to a waterbody, having originated from a different region, which can potentially alter the native ecosystem balance and cause significant economic and ecological damages.", "Unwelcome aquatic inhabitants introduced through human activity, particularly large vessels that traverse regional waterways, which can disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems and impose significant economic and ecological costs."], "economic analysis": ["A methodical evaluation of the tangible and intangible benefits and costs associated with a phenomenon, aimed at determining the potential consequences of a specific action or policy on a regional ecosystem, in order to inform decision-making and optimize outcomes while minimizing potential losses.", "A systematic evaluation of the financial repercussions and benefits of various actions or scenarios, aimed at quantifying their potential impact on natural systems, such as ecosystems, and determining the most optimal approach for mitigating losses and preserving valuable resources, as exemplified by the analysis of the economic impacts of nonindigenous species introductions in the Great Lakes ecosystem.", "The systematic evaluation of the financial benefits and costs of a phenomenon, in this case, the impact of nonindigenous aquatic species on the ecosystem services of the Great Lakes, with the goal of informing decision-making and policy development.", "The systematic assessment of the monetary worth and potential consequences of environmental changes, allowing decision-makers to evaluate and prioritize options to minimize harm to ecosystems and maximize benefits to society.", "A systematic process of evaluating the value and feasibility of alternatives to achieve specific goals, by assigning monetary and social values to the impacts of each option on a region's ecological and economic systems, with the ultimate aim of making informed decisions that balance human activities with environmental stewardship."], "economic valuation": ["The process of assigning a numerical value to the loss or degradation of essential goods and services provided by a ecosystem, reflecting the impact on human well-being, economic activity, and the overall quality of life, by estimating the value of the benefits that would have been received if the ecosystem had been preserved in its natural state.", "The process of assigning a tangible, monetary significance to the degradation of natural systems and the loss of their beneficial functions, thereby capturing the implicit value that society places on their preservation and integrity.", "The process of assigning a measurable monetary value to the benefits and losses resulting from the introduction or exclusion of non-native species in an ecosystem, in order to provide a framework for decision-making and policy development.", "The process of assigning financial significance to the hypothetical losses or alterations caused by non-natural entities entering a sensitive ecological environment, thereby enabling policymakers to make informed decisions about measures to prevent or mitigate these impacts.", "The process of assigning a monetary value to the effects of human activities on a natural ecosystem, allowing policymakers and stakeholders to weigh the benefits and costs of different management options and make informed decisions that balance human needs with environmental sustainability, thereby preventing potential catastrophes like invasive species disrupting the delicate balance of the Great Lakes' ecosystem services."], "shipping": ["The deliberate movement of vessels carrying goods and potentially hazardous cargo through large bodies of water, posing a risk to the ecological balance and economic well-being of surrounding ecosystems.", "The movement of vessels carrying exotic biological cargo across international waterways, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of ecosystems and economy in surrounding regions.", "The transport of goods and commodities across bodies of water, often carried out by large vessels that navigate international trade routes, potentially introducing non-native species to new ecosystems and altering the delicate balance of biodiversity.", "The intentional or unintentional transportation of non-native organisms across bodies of water, often facilitated by vessels, which can have significant economic and ecological impacts on recipient ecosystems.", "The act of transporting goods or materials across large bodies of water using specially designed vessels, which can potentially pose a threat to the ecological balance and economic well-being of coastal regions."]}
