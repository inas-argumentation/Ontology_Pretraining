thereby providing reliable predictions for identifying high-risk areas of invasion.", "The extent to which a statistical representation of environmental relationships accurately predicts the likelihood of an invasive species occurrence in a given area, taking into account the trade-off between data availability and spatial extrapolation.", "The degree to which a statistical representation of an ecological process or pattern accurately reflects the actual characteristics of the system, as determined by evaluating its ability to correctly predict outcomes in previously unseen areas or scenarios.", "The degree to which a predicted spatial distribution of a species accurately reflects its true distribution, while minimizing uncertainty and errors, thereby informing effective management and prevention strategies for invasive species.", "The ability of a statistical framework to accurately depict the distribution and habits of an invasive species, considering the trade-off between incorporating comprehensive data and minimizing spatial extrapolation."], "model transferability": ["The ability of a species distribution model to accurately predict the presence or absence

regions where the model is applied.", "The ability of a species distribution model to accurately predict the invasion risk of an organism in unexplored areas, without being overly influenced by the dominant ecological factors and limiting conditions found in the regions where the data were originally collected, thus enabling effective management and prevention strategies across different spatial scales.", "The extent to which the predictions of a habitat suitability model, developed for a specific region, remain reliable and accurate when applied to other areas where data is limited or unavailable, while still capturing the underlying patterns of species responses to environmental variation.", "The extent to which a predictive tool developed based on a particular spatial extent can effectively capture and replicate its underlying relationships and patterns when applied to novel or unfamiliar geographic areas, without requiring significant modification or adjustment.", "The ability of an ecological forecast or predictive tool to maintain accuracy and relevance when applied to a specific geographic area or ecological context, despite being based on a broader dataset or

species can thrive and establish itself, making it a critical consideration for understanding the potential distribution and spread of invasive organisms.", "The spatially varying set of conditions that a species can occupy and thrive in, which is shaped by the complex interplay of ecological and environmental factors, but remains relatively constant across broader geographic scales, allowing for more generalizable predictive models of its distribution.", "The unique set of conditions and limitations that a species requires to survive and thrive, which can be inferred by analyzing the relationships between its presence or absence and environmental factors across its range.", "The unique combination of conditions and factors that allow a species to thrive and reproduce within a specific geographic area, encompassing not only the immediate habitat requirements but also the broader regional and continental factors that shape its distribution.", "The combination of ecological factors and conditions that determines a species' ability to thrive and occupy a specific range or territory, encompassing not only physical attributes such as climate, topography, and vegetation, but also complex interactions and relationships that shape its population dynamics and distribution."]}
