impact on the native population.", "A large, invasive bivalve mollusk native to China, capable of rapidly expanding its population and dominating the ecosystem of large lakes in Europe, posing a significant threat to native species.", "A large, invasive bivalve mollusk native to China, notorious for rapidly establishing dominant populations in freshwater lakes and potentially disrupting the ecological balance by outcompeting native species.", "A large, invasive bivalve species that has rapidly established itself in a European lake, exhibiting a distinctive distribution pattern characterized by high abundances and biomass in specific areas, and has significant ecological impacts on native species by outcompeting them for resources."], "spread pattern": ["The pattern of distribution of a non-native species, often shaped by factors such as environmental conditions, proximity to an initial introduction point, and competition with native species, which can reveal its rapid colonization rate and potential for population growth.", "The measure of the geographic distribution of a species or population across a particular area, indicating the concentration or dispersal of its members over space and time, often influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, migration patterns, and ecological interactions.", "The manner in which a particular species occupies and disperses within a designated area, often influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, proximity to a point of introduction, and interactions with native species, ultimately shaping its distribution and abundance across that space.", "The manner in which a species' distribution expands across an environment, influenced by factors such as abundance, biomass, and spatial
