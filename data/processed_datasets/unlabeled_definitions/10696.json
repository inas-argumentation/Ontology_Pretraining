its survival."], "north atlantic": ["A region characterized by a convergence of maritime temperatures, where the northward extent of certain invasive marine species and aquaculture industries converge, influencing local ecological dynamics and habitat conservation priorities.", "A vast, northern body of water, characterized by a dynamic interplay of maritime forces, where the range of certain marine species can fluctuate, and local aquaculture industries and ecological conservation efforts must adapt to their ever-expanding presence.", "A vast aquatic territory where species native to distant shores can venture, often displacing local ecosystems, and where the boundaries of habitable zones are regularly rewritten by climate shifts and human intervention.", "The area characterized by a confluence of warm and cold waters, where a balance between aquaculture activities and conservation of marine habitats is crucial, with a distinct boundary defined by the farthest northern reaches of a non-native species' range.", "The region encompassing the northernmost parts of Europe and surrounding waters, characterized by a mix of established and expanding ranges of non-native species, with certain areas exhibiting a lack of equivalence in range expansion and highlighting the importance of conserving marine habitats amidst shifting environmental conditions."], "pacific oyster": ["A non-native species to Europe, first introduced as an alternative for aquaculture in the late 19th century, characterized by its ability to thrive in diverse temperature ranges,
