declines in the populations of predators and potentially cascading effects on other species in the food chain.", "The intentional or unintentional introduction and establishment of a non-native

species in the food chain.", "The introduction and establishment of an non-native species in a new ecosystem, resulting in significant impacts on native species populations, often leading to a decline in the relative abundance of predator species and a potential increase in the abundance of prey species.", "A non-native species, introduced into a new environment for various reasons, which spreads rapidly and significantly impacts the population dynamics of native predators, often leading to declines or shifts in their abundance, potentially with cascading effects on the entire ecosystem.",
