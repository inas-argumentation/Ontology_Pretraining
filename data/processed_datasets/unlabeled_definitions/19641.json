disturbed or recently colonized environments, but vulnerable to extinction due to the loss of founding members or changes in environmental conditions."], "temporal variation": ["The unpredictable fluctuation in genetic composition and structure of a population over a relatively short period, resulting from the interplay of factors such as environmental perturbations, demographic stochasticity, and genetic drift, which can significantly impact the population's ability to thrive and adapt in changing habitats.", "The observed changes or fluctuations in genetic characteristics, population dynamics, or demographic features of a species over a relatively short period of time, which may reflect adaptations to variable environmental conditions, demographic instability, or other stochastic

and spread, often leading to the rapid colonization of new areas, but vulnerable to local extinctions due to environmental fluctuations.", "The reproduction process by which a species disperses genetically identical individuals from a single original source, allowing it to rapidly colonize new areas and thrive in favorable environments, but making it vulnerable to local extinctions when faced with environmental disturbances or stochastic events.", "A biological process by which a single, genetically identical individual can multiply and establish a population in a given environment, potentially leading to a rapid increase in numbers, but also leaving the group vulnerable to changes in that environment.", "The process by which a species is able to rapidly colonize new areas
