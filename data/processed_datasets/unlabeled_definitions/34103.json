quickly recover from population bottlenecks and adapt to new surroundings through increased genetic diversity, often resulting in successful establishment in areas outside its native range.", "A species of insect known for its ability to rebound from limited starting populations through mechanisms such as gene flow, behavioral adaptations, and increased genetic variability, ultimately leading to successful establishment and potentially invasive growth in new territories.", "A species of bush-cricket known for its remarkable ability to adapt and thrive in new environments, characterized by its capacity to rapidly recover from population bottlenecks and maintain a high level of genetic diversity through mechanisms such as gene flow, behavioral adaptations, and increased mutation rates."], "establishment success": ["The attainment of a sustainable and resilient population state, marked by the gradual increase in genetic variability, increased adaptability, and the capacity to colonize new areas, ultimately resulting in the successful colonization of a previously uninhabited or underutilized territory.", "The degree to which a non-native species is able to reproduce and thrive in a novel environment, often determined by its ability to adapt to local conditions, evade competitors and predators, and eventually maintain or increase its population size over time.", "The capacity of a introduced population to thrive and persist over time, characterized by its ability to adapt and evolve through genetic changes, ultimately achieving a level of stability and sustainability that enables it to survive and reproduce in its new environment.", "The ability of an introduced population to thrive and stabilize over time, characterized by its capacity to maintain a sufficient number of individuals, adapt to the new environment, and exhibit genetic resilience, allowing it to become self-sustaining and potentially invasive.", "The measure of the ability of a non-native species to effectively occupy and maintain a new territory, which is often dependent on factors such as initial population size, genetic diversity, and environmental interactions, ultimately determining its potential for long-term survival and spread."], "propagule size": ["The initial quantity of genetic material introduced from a species' native range to a non-native environment, influencing the establishment and adaptability of the new population.", "The number of individuals initially introduced or founded in a new geographic area, which can influence the establishment and subsequent genetic diversity of the population.", "The number of individuals initially introduced into a new geographic area, which can significantly influence the success and genetic makeup of the established population.", "The initial number of individuals introduced into a novel environment, often a crucial determinant of a species' ability to establish a self-sustaining population, and which can influence the rate of genetic diversity recovery after a founding event.", "The initial number of individuals introduced into a new area from a source population, which plays a significant role in shaping the genetic makeup and potential for establishment of the new population."], "genetic bottleneck": ["The sudden reduction in the pool of genetic material that exists in a population, which can occur when a small group of individuals is separated from the larger population and becomes the foundation for a new population, potentially leading to a loss of genetic variation and increased inbreeding over time.", "A reduction in the original gene pool of a species that has been introduced to a new environment, resulting in a loss of genetic diversity, followed by a rapid recovery as the population adapts and expands.", "The sudden, significant reduction in the range of genetic variation within a population, often following the introduction of a small number of individuals from a larger ancestral population, which can initially lead to reduced genetic diversity and adaptation to new environments, but can also trigger a rapid recovery of genetic variation over time.", "A sudden and significant reduction in the number of distinct genetic traits present in a population, often followed by a rapid recovery in diversity as the population grows and adapts.", "A sudden and significant reduction in the genetic variation of a population, resulting in a limited number of effective reproducing individuals that can lead to a loss of genetic diversity, but can also trigger a rapid rebound in genetic variation as the population adapts and evolves over time."], "genetic variability": ["The intrinsic adaptability and resilience of a population, encompassing the range of subtle differences that enable individuals to thrive and respond to changing environmental pressures, and which can quickly recover from brief episodes of isolation or scarcity, ultimately yielding a diverse and robust gene pool.", "The propensity of a population's gene pool to spontaneously adapt and evolve over time, driven by a dynamic interplay of genetic material inherited from founders, random genetic events, and occasional influx of new genetic information from neighboring populations.", "The subtle yet vital property of a population's biological makeup, characterized by the presence of diverse yet coherent components, which enables its members to adapt, evolve, and thrive in response to changing environmental conditions, even in the face of severe disruptions.", "The extent to which a population's genetic makeup is characterized by a mix of distinct traits and characteristics inherited from its founders, which can recover and adapt over time to optimize its chances of survival and success in a new environment.", "The natural mixing of an organism's inherited characteristics, resulting from the combination of the genetic information passed down from its ancestors, which allows it to adapt to its environment and evolve over time."]}
