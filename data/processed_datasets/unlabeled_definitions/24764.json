crucial role of clothing and personal belongings in transporting propagules and potentially threatening indigenous flora.", "A remote sub-Antarctic destination known for its susceptibility to unauthorized biological introductions via human activity, particularly via clothing items worn by expeditioners and field workers.", "A remote, sub-Antarctic destination where expeditions to the continent often begin or end, posing a risk to the region's native ecosystem due to the unintended transportation of seeds on clothing and equipment.", "A remote, sub-Antarctic destination notorious for its invasive plant species, where the very fabric of clothing can become a conduit for unwanted seeds to spread and pose a threat to the region's native ecosystem, serving as a poignant reminder of the importance of strict conservation measures."], "antarctica": ["The coldest and most remote continent on Earth, where the conservation of native species is a pressing concern due to the threat
