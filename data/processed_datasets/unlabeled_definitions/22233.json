swept up and carried by wind or animals to colonize new areas, often displacing native species and dominating the landscape.", "A type of invasive grass that can thrive in grasslands, potentially outcompeting native species for resources, but can be managed through the strategic application of native plant litter to promote a shift towards a more desirable plant community.", "A type of

alter the growth and composition of the plant community, thereby influencing the overall ecological dynamics.", "The deliberate manipulation of a plant community's composition and structure through
