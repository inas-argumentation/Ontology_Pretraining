materials or environmental features that provide protection and sustenance for their young.", "A structure created by a bird species, typically consisting of twigs, grasses, and other plant material, used for reproductive purposes and typically lined with soft materials, such as feathers or plant fibers, to provide a safe and comfortable environment for breeding, laying eggs, and raising young, which can be found in rural landscapes inhabited by humans and can affect the population numbers of said bird species.", "A temporary, usually concealed or secluded location, where a population of birds congregates to engage in reproductive activities, characterized by the presence of gathered materials and possibly dependent young, often indicating a level of establishment and habituation."],
