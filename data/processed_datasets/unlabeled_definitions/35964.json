exotic fish to exploit a new food source.", "The physical changes that occur in an organism's body structure to better suit its environment, enabling it to thrive in its ecological niche, as seen in the case of the Chitala ornata, where changes in its diet are accompanied by corresponding changes in its digestive system and body shape.", "The physical characteristics of an organism that have evolved to better suit its environment, allowing it to more effectively obtain food, survive, and reproduce, such as alterations to body shape, scale structure, or fins that enable a fish to exploit specific resources or navigate a particular aquatic habitat."], "feeding": ["The act of assimilating nutrient-rich matter from an external source, wherein smaller specimens primarily consume and process plant-derived materials, whereas larger individuals transition to prey on other organisms, potentially exerting influence on native populations.", "The process by which an organism, driven by physiological necessity, actively engages with its environment to selectively gather and consume substances necessary for its survival, with the frequency and composition of its intake often changing with its growth and development.", "The process by which an organism takes in and utilizes nutrients, water, or other substances from its environment, which may vary significantly in type, quantity, and importance as the organism grows and develops.", "The process by which organisms take in and digest substances for sustenance, characterized by the selection and consumption of specific nutrients or prey items that vary with an individual's growth stage or life cycle.", "The process by which an organism consumes and extracts nutrients from its environment, marked by a gradual transition from
