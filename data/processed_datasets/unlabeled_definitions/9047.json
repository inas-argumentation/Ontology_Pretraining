some becoming naturalized and others remaining casual or invasive.", "Plants that are not native to a particular region or ecosystem, and have been introduced through human activity or other natural processes, often altering the composition and ecological dynamics of the environment.", "A collective term for non-native plant species that have been introduced to a region through human activity or natural means, comprising both intentionally and unintentionally brought species that have established populations and are adapting to new environments, and those that have the potential to do so."],

to thrive and potentially outcompete native flora.", "Plants that have been present in a region for an extended period of time, likely as a result of historical human activity, and have established themselves in the local ecosystem, potentially altering its composition and dynamics.", "Plants that have been present in a region for so long that they have adapted to the local environment, often outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem dynamics, despite having originated from elsewhere.", "Species of plants that have been present in a region for a prolonged period, often centuries, and have adapted to the local environment, yet their introduction was not intentional or controlled, and they now share ecological niches with native species.", "Plants that have been living in a region for so long, they've had time to establish themselves in the natural environment, often taking on a role similar to native species, but still retaining a subtle exotic flavor."], "turkey": ["A land with a rich and diverse history of embracing foreign flora, where the line between cultivated and wild habitats is often blurred, and where the boundaries between intentional and accidental introductions can be difficult to define.", "A vast, diverse landmass with a rich flora, characterized by a blend of native species and intentional introductions from across the globe, often giving rise to lush, yet ecologically complex, urban and natural habitats.", "A country with a unique blend of naturalized and casual plant species from diverse geographic origins, where the majority of its flora has been intentionally introduced for ornamental purposes, and its landscape is characterized by a rich variety of phanerophytes, woody vines, stem succulents, and aquatic plants.", "A country with a unique blend of flora, where a vibrant tapestry of plants from far-flung continents has woven itself into the cultural and ecological fabric, with a notable emphasis on perennials, annuals, and woody vegetation, brought about through intentional and accidental introductions from diverse regions.", "A land mass, rich in biodiversity, with a flora that has been shaped by intentional and accidental introductions from around the world, where the distinction between cultivated and wild areas is often blurred, and where the boundaries between natural and disturbed habitats are porous."], "neophytes": ["Plants that have recently arrived in a new environment and have a significant chance of establishing themselves and multiplying, often spreading through human activities such as intentional introductions or accidental transportation, and whose naturalization potential is still in its early stages.", "Plants that have recently arrived in a new region, either through deliberate human introduction or unintentional dispersal, and have successfully established themselves in the wild, often exhibiting rapid population growth and potential for ecological impact.", "Plant species that have been recently introduced to a region through human activity, having a established a presence but not yet fully integrated into the native ecosystem, and exhibit varying levels of adaptation to their new environment, ranging from casual presence to widespread naturalization.", "Plants that have recently arrived in a region through human activity, have adapted to the local environment, and are establishing themselves in their new habitat, often becoming naturalized over time.", "Species that have entered a region through recent human activity, often with a high likelihood of establishment and spreading, and can be either naturalized or casual, but are typically introduced intentionally as ornamental plants or crops, and may pose a threat to native ecosystems."],

and long-term persistence.", "The duration over which a non-native plant species persists in a new environment, having traversed from its original native range, and has begun to adapt and establish itself, often shaping the local flora and fauna.", "The period of continuous presence or establishment of a non-native species in a new environment, marked by the gradual adaptation and proliferation of its populations, often influenced by human activities or natural events.", "The duration over which a non-native plant species remains in a given environment, persisting and potentially adapting to local conditions, before becoming fully integrated into the ecosystem, often marked by the transition from occasional and isolated occurrences to more widespread and established populations.", "The
