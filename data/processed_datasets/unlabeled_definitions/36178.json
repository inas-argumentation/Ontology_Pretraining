ficus-indica, disrupts the natural distribution of native flora.", "A statistical measure that assesses the variation in the distribution of different plant species within a community, providing insight into the richness and evenness of species populations, and is often used to understand the impact of invasive species on native ecosystems."], "homogenization": ["The uniform spreading of alien influences throughout a region, resulting in the gradual erosion of unique local characteristics and the loss of distinct species compositions.", "The phenomenon where a dominant non-native species in an ecosystem gradually replaces or supplants native species, altering the composition of the plant community and reducing its overall uniqueness.", "The process by which the unique characteristics of a community's ecosystem are gradually replaced with more widespread and uniform characteristics, leading to a loss of local biodiversity and a diminished distinction between individual ecosystems.", "The process by which the unique characteristics of a local ecosystem are subtly erased, leaving behind a uniform composition of species that are often more tolerant of harsh conditions, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and a diminished ecological identity.", "The process by which an invasive species gradually erases the distinct characteristics and patterns of a native ecosystem, replacing it with a uniform, altered landscape that is dominated by the invasive species, potentially resulting in the loss of local biodiversity and ecosystem resilience."], "species
