resulting in a loss of at least 90% of the population within a decade, with a duration of at least three consecutive years.", "A significant decrease in the numerical abundance of a species, characterized by a sudden and substantial loss of individuals over a relatively short period, often indicating a disruption to the population's ecological equilibrium.", "A phenomenon characterized by a significant decrease in the number of individuals within a established group, often occurring without warning and persisting for an extended period, which can have substantial consequences for the group's long-term viability and the ecosystems it inhabits."], "invasive birds": ["Birds that, having been introduced to a new area, often thrive and multiply rapidly, yet can suddenly experience a severe and unexpected decline in population, causing concerns for local ecosystems and necessitating timely management and control measures.", "Species of birds that exhibit sudden and severe population drops in established non-native populations, often persisting for extended periods and defying explanations based on taxonomic order or geographic location, thereby posing a persistent threat to ecosystems and necessitating proactive management and conservation strategies.", "Species of non-native avifauna that exhibit a sudden and profound decrease in population size, often following a period of successful establishment, with the potential to cause ecological, economic, or social disruption.", "A group of non-native avian species that, having established themselves in a new environment, have the capacity to rapidly and precipitously decline in population, often leading to spontaneous collapses that can have significant ecological and management implications.", "A species of avifauna introduced to a non-native ecosystem through human activity, which can exhibit sudden and precipitous population declines, often with far-reaching ecological consequences."],

experience sudden and profound declines in population.", "Species of birds that have been introduced to a region outside of their natural range, often through human activity, and can potentially outcompete or displace native bird species, exhibiting unpredictable and potentially catastrophic declines in population size over a short period of time.", "A species of bird that has been introduced to a new region outside its natural geographic range, often through human activity, and has established a breeding population, but is at risk of sudden and significant decline due to various ecological and environmental factors.", "Birds that have been introduced to a non-native environment through human activities, resulting in the establishment of a new population, and often exhibiting rapid and unpredictable changes in their abundance and distribution.", "Species of birds introduced to a new geographic area, often through human activity, which have become well-established but may
