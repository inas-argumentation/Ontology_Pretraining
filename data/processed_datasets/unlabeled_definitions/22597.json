features, often previously known only from specific tropical regions, but also occasionally found in other parts of the world.", "Large, conspicuous fungi with distinct characteristics that are widely distributed across various regions, sometimes found in unexpected locations, and can be identified through a combination of macro- and micro-features, including similarities and differences with other related species.", "Large, conspicuous fungus-like organisms that thrive in various tropical and subtropical regions, featuring distinctive macro- and micro-characteristics that set them apart from similar species, and often found in a variety of localities across eastern North America."], "trametes lactine": ["A striking and widespread polypore fungus that thrives in subtropical regions, characterized by its large size and distinctive features, which are often misattributed to its more temperate relatives.", "A large, conspicuous polypore fungus characterized by its wide distribution and unexpected presence in temperate regions, often distinguished by unique macro- and micro-features that differentiate it from similar species.", "A large, conspicuous fungus with a wide distribution, previously thought to be exclusive to tropical regions but now known to thrive in temperate climates, characterized by its distinctive macro- and micro-features that set it apart from similar species.", "A tropical fungal species, previously confined to warm climates, has made a surprising debut in the eastern United States, boasting large, eye-catching caps and unique features that set it apart from its closest relatives.", "A type of large, easily recognizable fungi native to tropical regions, but surprisingly discovered in the eastern United States, characterized by distinct macro- and micro-features that distinguish it from similar species."], "usa": ["A vast landmass where tropical species can suddenly find themselves in an unexpected new home, surrounded by diverse flora and fauna that share their stories through sequenced ITS regions.", "A vast territory of temperate and tropical climates, where diverse regions are home to a rich variety of flora, and is often traversed by vast networks of rivers, mountains, and valleys, whose boundaries and vast expanse have been shaped by geological and ecological processes over millions of years, and is inhabited by a wide range of human populations, each with their own unique cultural and linguistic heritage.", "A vast, temperate region with a diverse range of climates and ecosystems, boasting an incredible array of macro- and micro-organisms that can only be fully appreciated through meticulous scientific investigation.", "A vast region with a diverse geography and climate, characterized by an abundance of various fungal species, including the occasional rare and exotic ones, often discovered in previously unexplored localities.", "A vast and temperate landmass, often characterized by its diverse geography, notable for the unexpected presence of tropical phenomena in its eastern extremities."], "tropical species": ["A type of fungus that is native to warm, humid environments and is typically characterized by its large size, striking appearance, and unique characteristics that set it apart from its closer relatives.", "A type of organism that is characterized by its widespread presence in warm and humid regions, often exhibiting a striking appearance and limited distribution in temperate or subtropical areas, typically requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive and reproduce.", "A species that is typically found in warm and humid regions, characterized by its prominent appearance and widespread distribution, often discovered in areas previously thought to be unsuitable for its occurrence.", "A species that is typically found in warm and humid climates, often characterized by its striking appearance and previously known only from certain geographical regions, which can subsequently be discovered to have a wider distribution than initially thought.", "A fungus characterized by a widespread yet geographically limited distribution, often found in specific regions with a distinct climatic or ecological profile, and typically identified by unique macroscopic and microscopic features that distinguish it from closely related species."], "its region": ["The region of an organism's DNA that contains a repeating pattern of nucleotides and is often used as a marker to identify species.", "The specific portion of the DNA sequence used for identification and classification purposes, particularly in the realm of fungal species, where it serves as a distinguishing trait among related genera.", "A specific segment of a gene or genome that
