{"motile epifauna": ["A type of marine organism that is adapted to living on and moving around on artificial surfaces or structures, often traveling long distances by hitching rides on floating objects, and is frequently found in areas with moderate to high levels of pollution, such as ports, harbors, and aquaculture facilities.", "Animals that inhabit and thrive on artificial marine structures, typically exhibiting a capacity to move and colonize new areas, often adapting to environments that are disturbed by human activities such as aquaculture or ship traffic.", "Aquatic animals that are capable of movement and settlement on artificial or submerged surfaces, often forming colonies that are adapted to thrive in diverse marine environments, and which can exhibit a strong tolerance to changing conditions.", "Organisms that move and settle on artificial structures in coastal areas, often dominating the community composition and exhibiting strong adaptations to thrive in these novel environments.", "Marine animals that actively move and settle on surfaces, often found in clusters, and play a crucial role in forming complex communities that thrive on artificial structures, such as underwater farming equipment and floating objects."], "epibionts": ["Tiny, often overlooked inhabitants that thrive on the artificial surfaces of coastal structures, particularly those associated with marine aquaculture and shipping infrastructure, where they play a crucial role in shaping the ecosystem and sometimes even becoming a nuisance.", "Organisms that thrive on artificial structures in marine environments, often forming diverse assemblages that reflect the resilience and adaptability of certain species to varying levels of pollution and dispersal pathways.", "Organisms that thrive on and adapt to artificial surfaces, often dominating the biodiversity of these environments, and frequently display remarkable resilience in the face of pollution and dispersal by floating objects, occasionally introducing non-native species to new ecosystems.", "Organisms that colonize and thrive on artificial or natural structures, often exhibiting remarkable resilience to environmental variability and anthropogenic influences, and playing a crucial role in shaping the complex ecosystems associated with these surfaces.", "Organisms that have adapted to inhabit and thrive in human-made structures, such as ropes, buoys, or platforms, in the Mediterranean Sea and beyond, often with remarkable resilience to polluted environments and transportation via floating objects."], "fouling communities": ["A diverse assemblage of marine species that settle and thrive on artificial underwater structures, often in association with human activities such as aquaculture, and are characterized by a mix of stationary and mobile organisms that have adapted to exploit these altered habitats.", "A unique assemblage of marine organisms that colonize and settle on artificial structures, such as off-coast aquaculture facilities, and thrive in a complex interplay of environmental factors and interactions with other organisms.", "A diverse collection of organisms that colonize and thrive on artificial structures or surfaces in marine environments, often exhibiting remarkable adaptability and resistance to environmental pressures, with some species exhibiting significant potential for dispersal and invasion.", "A collective assemblage of aquatic organisms that colonize and thrive on artificial or modified underwater structures, such as those surrounding aquaculture facilities, exhibiting adaptations to survive and reproduce in these environments.", "Assemblages of organisms that colonize and settle on artificial structures in marine environments, creating diverse communities that are adapted to thrive in these specific habitats, often characterized by a dominance of certain species."]}
