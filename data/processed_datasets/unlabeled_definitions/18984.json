{"aquarium fish": ["Ornamental aquatic animals raised in captivity for visual display or pleasure, often originating from non-native habitats and having a higher probability of establishing themselves in a new environment due to intentional human introduction.", "Finned aquatic organisms, often bred in artificial environments for human entertainment, whose introduction to non-native ecosystems poses a risk to native species and habitats, as exemplified by their widespread commercial trade and subsequent establishment in new areas.", "Small, ornamental fish species bred and cultivated for human observation and pleasure in specialized vessels, often introduced to novel environments through global trade and commerce.", "Finned, ornamental aquatic species kept for recreational purposes, which are often intentionally introduced to new environments through intentional or unintentional pathways, such as commercial trade or human travel.", "Small, usually colorful, finned animals that are popularly kept in artificially aquatic environments for recreational purposes, but may occasionally be accidentally or intentionally released into the wild, posing a risk of establishment and potential ecological disruption."], "establishment curves": ["A graphical representation of the likelihood of a non-native species successfully colonizing and thriving in a new environment, as a function of the quantity of individuals introduced, or \"invasion pressure\", and the underlying biological and ecological factors that influence its ability to establish a sustainable population.", "A graphical representation of the likelihood of successful colonization by a non-native species, visualizing the relationship between the quantity of individuals introduced and the probability of a population taking hold, while accounting for the unique characteristics of a particular pathway of introduction and the species' inherent abilities to establish.", "A mathematical representation that depicts the probability of a non-native species to successfully colonize and thrive in a new environment, based on the intensity of its introduction, taking into account the variation in the species' ability to establish itself and the consistency of the data used to predict its fate.", "A visual representation of the likelihood of a species to successfully settle and thrive in a new environment, taking into account the cumulative effect of various introduction pathways and the strength of biological invasion.", "A graphical representation of the probability of successful invasion by a non-indigenous species, determined by its propagule pressure, with implications for predicting and managing the risk of establishment in a new environment."], "pathway-level analysis": ["The examination of the likelihood of a non-native species becoming established in a new environment by analyzing the specific route or channel through which the species is introduced, considering factors such as the number and frequency of introductions, species' characteristics, and other relevant variables.", "An examination of the factors influencing the likelihood of introduction and successful establishment of non-indigenous species, focusing on the routes and channels through which these species are introduced, and analyzing the data related to these routes to predict the probability of establishment.", "The examination of specific channels or routes through which non-indigenous species are introduced to a new environment, with a focus on identifying the key factors that influence the likelihood of establishment, in order to inform risk assessments and inform management decisions aimed at mitigating the potential impacts of invasions.", "A detailed examination of the factors influencing the probability of establishment of non-indigenous species at the stage where they first interact with a new environment, incorporating information on the number and quality of individuals arriving through specific routes or vectors.", "An examination of the relationship between the intensity and type of introductions of a species to an ecosystem and its likelihood of becoming established, utilizing aggregated data to capture patterns and trends."], "importation": ["The act of facilitating the unintentional or intentional arrival of non-native organisms in a new geographic area, often via trade, commerce, or human activity, with the potential to alter ecosystems and pose risks to the environment, human health, and biodiversity.", "The introduction of a species into a new region through human activities, such as trade, commerce, or recreational pursuits, which can lead to the establishment of a new non-indigenous population, potentially disrupting the local ecosystem.", "The act of introducing a species into a new geographic area, facilitated by human activity, often with unintended consequences for the receiving ecosystem.", "The intentional or unintentional movement of non-native organisms from their natural habitats to a new geographic region through a controlled or uncontrolled channel, often facilitated by human activity and with potential consequences for the invaded ecosystem.", "The process of bringing in and making available for use or propagation, often across geographical boundaries, a quantity of living organisms or plant material, typically through a controlled and regulated channel, which can have significant implications for the potential introduction and establishment of non-native species."]}
