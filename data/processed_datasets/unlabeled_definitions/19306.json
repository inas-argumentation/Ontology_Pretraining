portion of its original ecological preferences and adaptations, allowing it to successfully occupy new environments with minimal modification of its existing resource utilization strategies.", "The tendency for a plant species to maintain a consistent ecological role or occupation in a new environment, with minimal changes to its habitat preferences, resource utilization, or competitive relationships with other species, allowing it to persist and thrive in a novel ecosystem.", "The persistence of a species' ecological characteristics and adaptability to its environment, such that it remains relatively unchanged in its new range despite geographic isolation and potential shifts in climate or other environmental factors.", "The retention of ecological preferences and habits during an invasion, indicating that an introduced species tends to occupy environments that are similar to those of its native range, without necessarily adapting to novel habitats.", "The tendency of a species to maintain a consistent ecological requirement or habitability range, without significant changes, as it colonizes a new geographic region or adapts to new environmental conditions."],

specific combination of environmental factors that a plant species is best suited to thrive in, including temperature, precipitation, and other conditions, which it tends to occupy and exploit in its native range, often being more efficient in those conditions due to evolutionary adaptations.", "The ecological profile of a species, characterized by a specific combination of environmental conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, and soil quality, that determine its ability to thrive and persist in a given region, while also influencing its potential for expansion and adaptation to new territories.", "The complex interplay between a species' environmental tolerance and the climatic conditions it encounters, encompassing the subtle interconnections between temperature, precipitation, and humidity patterns, which ultimately defines its adaptability and ability to thrive within a specific geographic range."]}
