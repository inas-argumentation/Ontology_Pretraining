population size": ["The cumulative measure of the number of individuals residing within a defined geographical area, often associated with urbanization, agricultural development, and economic activity, which can influence the introduction and establishment of non-native soil macroinvertebrates in regions.", "The collective measure of human presence in a region, encompassing both the sheer number of individuals occupying the area and the concentration of settlements and infrastructure, which can have a profound impact on the distribution and abundance of introduced species.", "The total

and is associated with changes in climate, ecosystem composition, and the distribution of soil macroinvertebrates.", "The dimension that describes the relative position of a location on a planet's surface, from areas that experience more intense solar radiation and warmer temperatures near the equatorial regions to areas that experience more moderate and sometimes colder conditions towards the poles.", "The measurable distance from a region's terrestrial axis of rotation to the nearest oceanic or maritime influence, thus reflecting the subtle interplay between geographical and ecological factors that shape the distribution and abundance of species.", "The distance north or south of a reference point on the Earth's surface, measuring the gradual shift from a region's unique biological

measure of a location's distance from the imaginary line that runs through the center of the Earth, with higher values indicating positions farther from this line, and thus potentially influencing the distribution and abundance of soil macroinvertebrates introduced from different regions."], "biotic homogenization": ["The gradual process by which species with varied geographic origins and adaptations converge in their distribution patterns across a region, leading to a loss of regional distinctiveness in the composition of local ecosystems, as influenced by human activities such as habitat modification, trade, and migration.", "The process by which the distribution and abundance of species in a region are increasingly shaped by factors external to the region's native biodiversity, leading to a convergence of species assemblages and loss of endemic characteristics.", "The process by which the native species composition of an ecosystem becomes less diverse and distinct due to the influence of human activities, leading to a more uniform distribution of species across different regions, often resulting in a decline of unique local species assemblages.", "The gradual process by which the diversity of a region's soil-dwelling invertebrates becomes increasingly dominated by species that have been introduced from other parts of the world, often resulting in a loss of unique native species and altered patterns of distribution in response to environmental and human-induced factors.", "The gradual process by which the regional distinctiveness of soil invertebrate communities is diminished as the species composition becomes increasingly influenced by the introduction of non-native species from distant regions, ultimately leading to a reduction in
