human activities on wildlife populations and habitats, with a focus on controlling invasive species, promoting the growth of native vegetation, and restoring ecological function to historically altered sites, all in an attempt to maintain and enhance the health and diversity of regional wildlife communities.", "The strategic balance between human development and natural ecosystem preservation, achieved through a multifaceted approach that mitigates the impact of invasive species, maintains and restores native habitats, and adapts management practices to dynamic environmental
