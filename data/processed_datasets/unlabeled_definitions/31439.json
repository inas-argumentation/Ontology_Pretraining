thrive in unfamiliar environments, displaying an extraordinary capacity for adaptation, and are increasingly found in areas where human activity has disrupted natural ecosystems.", "Cold-blooded, ectothermic animals that have evolved to thrive in a variety of environments, from terrestrial to aquatic, with a remarkable ability to adapt to new regions through intentional and unintentional introductions, and whose successful establishment can have significant ecological and conservation implications.", "Cold-blooded, semi-aquatic or terrestrial vertebrates that have evolved to inhabit diverse environments and ecosystems, and which are often subject to intentional or unintentional introduction into new areas, where they may establish populations with potential impacts on native biodiversity.", "Warm-blooded creatures that walk on four legs or slither across the ground, often introduced to new habitats with a surprisingly high likelihood of thriving."], "establishment success": ["The attainment of a stable presence in a new environment, typically marked by the ability to reproduce and thrive, following the intentional or unintentional introduction of an organism from another location.", "The proportion of intentionally or unintentionally introduced species that successfully become self-sustaining populations in a new geographic area, often characterized by breeding, reproduction, and spreading beyond their original range.", "The measure of a non-native species' ability to persist and thrive in its new environment, typically expressed as a proportion of successfully introduced individuals that survive and reproduce, exceeding the initial expectations of a 10% chance of success, as supported by studies on multiple taxa, including herptiles, birds, and mammals.", "The percentage of introduced species that successfully colonize a new geographic area, survive, and reproduce, resulting in a self-sustaining population.", "The proportion of non-native species that are able to become self-sustaining and reproduce in a new geographic region, despite initial introduction and potential initial competition."], "global": ["The totality of a phenomenon's occurrence or presence across all geographic regions, encompassing a vast scope that transcends local or regional boundaries, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the entire spectrum of its manifestation.", "The collective culmination of isolated incidents that, when aggregated, reflect a comprehensive and inclusive understanding of a phenomenon across diverse geographic locations and ecosystems, thereby encompassing a broad and representative scope.", "The extent or range that encompasses all occurrences or instances of a particular phenomenon, characteristic, or feature across multiple locations, environments, and ecosystems, often involving multiple continents, regions, or islands, and reflecting a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon in question.", "The comprehensive and universal scope of assessment, encompassing a diverse array of environments and ecosystems, where the outcomes of invasive species introduction are thoroughly evaluated to understand their establishment success rates.", "The scope and reach of a phenomenon, encompassing the entire range of locations and habitats where it can be observed, considered, or applied, encompassing all regions, territories, and ecological niches, with no geographical or environmental boundaries."], "herpetofauna": ["A group of organisms that have evolved remarkable adaptability to invade new habitats, with a significant proportion of species capable of establishing thriving populations in areas where they are not native, often with potentially harmful consequences for local ecosystems.", "The diverse group of cold-blooded vertebrates that often have a remarkable ability to thrive in new environments, with many species exhibiting a high likelihood of establishing populations following intentional or unintentional introductions to non-native areas, thus warranting focused management efforts to mitigate the potential impacts of such invasions.", "The collective term for a diverse group of terrestrial vertebrates, commonly introduced through human activity, which possess a remarkable ability to thrive and establish populations in new environments, with some species exhibiting a higher likelihood of success than others.", "Cold-blooded vertebrates that are notorious for their ability to thrive in new environments, with a collective establishment success rate significantly higher than 10%, and therefore requiring concerted management efforts to mitigate the impacts of their introductions on native ecosystems.", "The collective term for a diverse group of species that often thrive in environments disturbed or altered by human activity, characterized by their ability to adapt and establish populations in new regions, particularly in tropical and temperate zones, with certain groups exhibiting a high propensity for successful invasion and colonization of native ecosystems."], "tens rule": ["A widely-held assumption that a relatively small proportion of non-native species will successfully establish themselves in a new environment, despite the overwhelming majority of introductions failing to achieve this goal.", "The concept that a proportion of introduced species will establish themselves in a new environment, with the proportion being roughly 10% of the total number of introduced species, and thus has implications for management strategies to mitigate the impact of invasive species.", "A widely-held principle suggesting that only a limited proportion of intentionally or unintentionally introduced species, often attributed to an underlying balance between establishment and failure rates, will successfully adapt and thrive in a new environment.", "The general notion that a substantial proportion of non-native species introduced to a new environment will successfully establish themselves, often leading to ecological and biological consequences.", "A general guideline proposing that a significant proportion of non-native species introduced into a new environment will successfully establish themselves, often with a moderate to high success rate, challenging the idea that establishment of invasive species is an exceptional occurrence."]}
