stricta": ["A prickly desert dweller, notorious for its prolific seeding and invasive tendencies, yet vulnerable to the attentions of small, furry seed-snatchers.", "A thorny, succulent plant that, when introduced to Mediterranean ecosystems, must compete with native species for resources and space, and whose seed dispersal and germination patterns are influenced by the presence and predation habits of small mammals and birds.", "A species of prickly pear cactus, renowned for its robust spread and tenacity, yet surprisingly susceptible to seed predation by small, nimble mammals that roam Mediterranean regions, where its invasive tendencies are often tempered by native herbivores.", "A prickly desert dweller, notorious for its widespread colonization of Mediterranean landscapes, often competing with native flora for resources and space.", "A spiny, desert-dwelling cactus species that has established itself in Mediterranean communities, where its invasive presence is tempered by the predation activities of small mammals."], "small mammals": ["Tiny, terrestrial vertebrates that are often overlooked but play a crucial role in shaping the ecological dynamics of their environments, particularly through their seed predation habits.", "Small terrestrial vertebrates, often nocturnal and omnivorous, whose small size and agility allow them to exploit plant resources in Mediterranean communities, playing a crucial role in shaping seed predation patterns and invasibility of ecosystems.", "Mammals that, in the context of Mediterranean ecosystems, play a crucial role in controlling the spread of invasive Opuntia species through their predation of fruit and seeds, and are likely to be responsible for consuming over half of the seeds produced.", "Small, terrestrial vertebrates
