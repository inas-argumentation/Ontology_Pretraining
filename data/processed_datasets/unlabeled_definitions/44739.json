a significant threat to the ecological integrity and biodiversity of its natural environment, particularly in high-elevation landscapes where its movement is naturally constrained, but can still exploit human-modified habitats to gain a foothold and disrupt delicate ecosystems.", "Species that, through human activities or natural means, have adapted to and spread beyond their native range,
