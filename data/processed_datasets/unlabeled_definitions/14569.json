conditions, unless triggered by specific and usually subtle cues, such as temperature fluctuations, darkness, or duration of residency on the parent plant.", "The temporary suspension of a plant's reproductive potential, where environmental factors such as reduced light, cool temperatures, and prolonged residence time on the parent plant can trigger a gradual activation process, allowing the reproductive unit to successfully germinate.", "The process by which seeds are held in a state of delayed or reduced germination until environmental conditions become favorable for successful seedling establishment, a phenomenon often characterized by the need for specific temperature fluctuations, reduced light levels, and prolonged exposure to soil moisture to break the seed's initial reluctance to sprout.", "The condition in which a plant's reproductive units remain in a state of suspended development, characterized by a reluctance to respond to favorable environmental cues, potentially due to a mismatch between internal physiological preparedness and external environmental conditions, which can ultimately impact germination rates and timing.", "The temporary suppression of a seed's germination capacity due to a combination of environmental factors, such as temperature fluctuations, reduced light levels, and physical constraints, which require a specific range of conditions to break the dormancy and initiate growth."], "seed germination": ["The process by which a resting stage in the reproductive cycle of a plant, which remains dormant and awaits optimal conditions, transforms into a sprouting structure, resulting in the emergence of a new individual.", "The emergence and establishment of a new plant from a dormant reproductive structure, facilitated by favorable environmental conditions such as temperature fluctuations, reduced light levels, and optimal moisture and soil quality, which enables the seeds to break dormancy and begin their life cycle.", "The process by which an immature plant, once detached from its parent, begins to emerge and develop its fundamental structures, facilitated by a range of environmental factors including temperature, light, moisture, and residence time.", "The process by which the dormant potential of a seed is awakened, resulting in the initiation of growth and development into a new plant, often influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, light, and moisture.", "The process by which a plant's reproductive structure, containing the potential for a new individual, awakens from dormancy and
