environment, often driven by human activity, which has resulted in the establishment of a self-sustaining population, with significant ecological impacts and potentially enduring legacies.", "The intentional or unintentional relocation of a species from its native range to a new geographic area, which occurred prior to the advent of modern biological exploration and has left a documented trail of historical records.", "The intentional or unintentional transfer of non-native species to a new region, resulting in the establishment of a new population, often facilitated by human activities such as trade, exploration, or colonization, and potentially occurring hundreds or thousands of years ago.", "The deliberate or unintentional transportation and establishment of a non-native species into a new geographical area through human activity, which has occurred prior to the industrial era, and has had a significant impact on the native ecosystem.", "The deliberate or unintentional
