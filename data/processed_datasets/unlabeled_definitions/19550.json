macroscopic organisms, and often influencing human activities and perceptions."], "freshwater": ["A term referring to bodies of water that are not directly connected to the open ocean, where species diversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates, such as crustaceans, can reach remarkable proportions, but can also pose a threat to ecosystems when non-native, large, and invasive species are

capture human attention.", "A type of aquatic ecosystem characterized by the presence of numerous macroinvertebrate species, with an abundance of crustaceans, particularly those that may pose an environmental or ecological threat if introduced beyond their native range, often due to their sheer numbers and adaptability.", "The habitat where certain crustaceans, usually not considered a public concern unless they are large and invasive, thrive in enormous numbers and varieties, despite being outnumbered by other inhabitants.", "The habitat occupied by species that thrive in environments where crustaceans can become an overwhelming presence, often numbering in the thousands and characterized by a diverse array of forms, but only raises concern when a subset of these species escapes their native bounds and becomes a dominant force."], "brackish water": ["Waters that are teeming with a diverse array of aquatic organisms, including crustaceans, which can sometimes become problematic due to their ability to thrive and adapt in unexpected environments.", "Waterbodies characterized by a mixture of freshwater and saltwater, typically inhabited by a diverse array of crustaceans, which can sometimes thrive to the point of becoming invasive and causing concern, yet often remain a crucial component of the aquatic ecosystem.", "Freshwater environments with a notable influx of saltwater characteristics, typically hosting a diverse array of macroinvertebrates that can potentially cause public concern when introduced to non-native habitats.", "Areas where freshwater meets saltwater, characterized by a unique mix of organisms that thrive in environments where two ecosystems converge, but can occasionally become home to non-native, potentially destructive species that alter the delicate balance.", "A type of aquatic environment characterized by a mixture of freshwater and saltwater influences, where the biodiversity of crustacean species is often high, but can become disrupted by the introduction of non-native species that can significantly alter the ecosystem."], "marine": ["Organisms that thrive in a terrestrial-aquatic interface, often forming a substantial portion of the macroinvertebrate community, but can occasionally expand their range to become a prominent concern due to their sheer numbers or size, thereby disrupting local ecosystems.", "A term used to describe the environment that typically harbors a vast array of aquatic life forms, often characterized by an abundance of species and individuals, but only occasionally garnering public attention when certain species migrate or establish themselves in unexpected, and sometimes unwelcome, locations.", "A term referring to a particular type of aquatic environment characterized by the presence of an abundance of micro- and macro-invertebrates, typically found in vast numbers and with a high level of species diversity, which can sometimes become the subject of public concern when large and non-native species establish themselves in new areas.", "Organisms that thrive in aquatic environments, with a high degree of diversity and abundance, often remaining under the radar unless they exhibit remarkable size or disruptive behavior, such as massive migrations or territorial expansions.", "Organisms that thrive in large numbers and diversities within freshwater ecosystems, often posing a problem for public concern only when their population sizes grow excessively and they become a nuisance."], "crustaceans": ["Tiny, often prolific aquatic creatures that can be numerous and diverse in their environments, but may occasionally cause concern when they spread beyond their natural habitats and grow to significant sizes.", "Small, often abundant, and potentially large and invasive aquatic organisms that can be prolific in numbers and species diversity, typically dwelling on or near water bodies.", "Aquatic dwellers that are incredibly diverse in species, yet often go unnoticed unless they thrive and overwhelm their environments, typically causing concern when they are large, adaptable, and introduce themselves unwelcome to new ecosystems.", "Small, typically aquatic, segmented creatures that thrive in great numbers and diversity, often going unnoticed until they grow large or become problematic by invading native environments.", "Aquatic arthropods that are often overlooked until they grow large and introduce themselves unwelcomed to a new environment, typically possessing multiple limbs and a hard exoskeleton, and which can thrive in incredible numbers, boasting a staggering array of species, despite receiving little public attention unless they become a nuisance."], "river": ["A vital, often overlooked, yet ecologically rich conduit that connects and nurtures life, featuring a diverse array of microscopic and macroscopic inhabitants, with some species thriving in numbers, while others can have a significant impact when
