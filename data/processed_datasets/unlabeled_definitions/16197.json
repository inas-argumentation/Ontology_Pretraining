intentional introduction of a natural predator or parasitoid into a non-native invasive pest's population, with the goal of establishing a stable, long-term relationship that would eventually lead to the reduction of the pest's numbers and ecological impact, while also minimizing harm to non-target species and human health.", "The intentional introduction of a natural predator or pathogen of an invasive pest species to a specific region with the goal of reducing the pest population, relying on the predator's or pathogen's ability to establish a balance in the ecosystem and mitigate the pest's impact, while minimizing unintended consequences to human health and the environment.", "The intentional introduction of a natural predator or parasite into a non-native pest population's environment, aimed at regulating the pest's population and reducing its impact on the ecosystem, while ensuring that the control agent does not harm non-target species or human health.", "The

population, while also minimizing potential negative impacts on human health and the environment.", "A methodology for managing the environmental impact of non-native species by deliberately
