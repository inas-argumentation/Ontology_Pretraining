challenging to control their spread and requiring proactive management measures to prevent their establishment in the first place.", "A complex dynamic whereby a disturbance or facilitating factor enables the establishment of an invasive species, which subsequently feeds back to perpetuate its own persistence, making it challenging to control or eradicate the invader without addressing the underlying processes that initially allowed it to thrive."], "persistence": ["The enduring presence of an introduced species in an environment, maintained through a dynamic equilibrium between its ability to adapt and thrive in response to changing conditions, and the reciprocal influence of these conditions on its survival and reproduction.", "The ability of an introduced species to maintain a

establishment of a non-native seaweed species into an ecosystem, facilitated by environmental disturbances that can create windows of opportunity for invasion and persistence, potentially outcompeting native species and altering the ecosystem's balance.", "The process by which non-native algae colonize and thrive in a previously unoccupied marine ecosystem, facilitated by life history characteristics unique to each species and potentially influenced by environmental disturbances that enable their establishment, spread, and persistence.", "The process by which non-native, free-floating aquatic organisms gain a foothold in a new ecosystem, often facilitated by external disturbances that disrupt the native community, and can lead to persistent and potentially detrimental impacts on the invaded environment.", "The process by which non-native, often ecologically adaptable, marine organisms establish themselves in a new environment, potentially outcompeting native species for resources, and persist through a complex interplay of their own unique characteristics and the influence of disturbances, human or natural, on the ecosystem."], "establishment": ["The initial successful colonization and foothold of a non-native species in an unfamiliar environment, often facilitated by factors such as disturbance or suitable ecological niches.", "The initial success and foothold of a non-native species in a new environment, marking the beginning of its potential to spread, persist, and potentially outcompete native species.", "The process by which an introduced species, typically characterized by a unique set of life history traits, takes hold in a new environment, facilitated or accelerated by external factors, and gains a foothold that enables it to flourish and potentially spread.", "The process by which a non-native organism settles into a new environment and begins to thrive, often facilitated by environmental disruptions that create opportunities for colonization.", "The process by which a non-native organism gains a foothold in a new environment, facilitated by a combination of its unique biological characteristics and external
