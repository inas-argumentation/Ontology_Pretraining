area that engage in activities that facilitate the global dispersal of non-native species, such as transportation, trade, and colonization, ultimately contributing to the proliferation of invasive floras on tropical islands."], "nestedness": ["A phenomenon where the distribution of species across different locations follows a hierarchical pattern, with a core set of common species present in most locations, surrounded by a secondary layer of species unique to a subset of locations, and a peripheral layer of species found only in isolated or distinct locations.", "The way in which the distribution of a set of organisms across a set of islands mirrors the distribution of the islands themselves, with smaller islands often hosting a subset of the species found on larger islands, reflecting a combination of factors including island size, habitat diversity, and the pathways of species introduction.", "The pattern of uneven distribution of species across islands, where certain islands serve as \"hubs\" for a subset of species, which are more likely to be present on multiple islands, while other islands host a unique set of species, often rare or endemic to a particular group of islands, resulting in a complex network of species presence and absence.", "The arrangement of distinct entities, such as plant species or islands, in a hierarchical structure, where smaller or more specific elements are typically found within larger or more general ones, and where the prevalence or abundance of these elements is often linked to characteristics of the larger units.", "The arrangement of multiple components, typically at different scales, where the inclusion of a given component is more likely to occur when a certain set of preconditions are met, resulting in a hierarchical structure where smaller units are subsets of larger ones, and the probability of a component's presence is influenced by the presence of other components."], "pacific": ["A term referring to a collection of remote landmasses scattered across vast ocean expanses, characterized by a unique blend of geographical and ecological factors that influence the distribution and prevalence of non-native plant species, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between island size, elevation, and human population density.", "A term referring to a group of landmasses scattered across a

delicate balance between the forces of isolation and the influences of human activity, resulting in a complex tapestry of native and non-native species interactions.", "A region characterized by an

presence or absence of a species on an island is influenced by the availability and diversity of its ecological niche, resulting in a hierarchical arrangement of species and islands that reflects the compatibility between species and their respective island environments.", "The process by which the distribution of non-native invasive species across tropical islands is influenced by the diversity and characteristics of the islands' natural areas, such that islands with greater habitat diversity and complexity tend to harbor a wider range of invasive species, while those with more limited habitats tend to support a smaller subset of invaders.", "The process by which the characteristics of an environment, such as topography or elevation, influence the distribution and diversity of
