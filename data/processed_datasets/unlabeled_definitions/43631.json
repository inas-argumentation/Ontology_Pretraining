native habitat, thereby exploiting novel ecological niches.", "A type of weed that thrives in foreign soils, exhibiting growth patterns that are sometimes misattributed to a genetic predisposition, but are often a result of its adaptable nature in a novel environment.", "A type of plant species known to adapt surprisingly well to foreign environments, where it has been observed to exhibit remarkable growth and reproductive potential."], "echium valgare": ["A weed species known for its ability to thrive in unfamiliar environments, often demonstrating an extraordinary capacity for growth

responsiveness of a plant's physical characteristics, such as height and reproductive output, to changes in their surroundings.", "A carefully controlled test of plant development, where individuals of the same species are placed in a uniform setting to compare the impact of environmental conditions on their physical characteristics.", "A controlled comparison of plant specimens from diverse environments, in which identical conditions are provided to ensure that any observed differences in physical characteristics are solely due to inherent genetic or developmental differences between the
