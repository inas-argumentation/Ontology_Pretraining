aiming to restore degraded or depleted habitats by introducing a fast-growing, non-native woody species, which can exhibit superior growth performance and competitive advantage, but may also pose invasive potential, necessitating careful monitoring and management to ensure ecological balance.", "A type of reforestation effort that involves the intentional introduction of fast-growing, salt-tolerant woody species into tropical or subtropical coastal ecosystems, often with the goal of promoting ecosystem recovery, but which can also have unintended consequences, such as competition with native species and potential for invasive spread.", "A human-assisted coastal ecosystem rehabilitation project that involves introducing fast-growing, salt-tolerant woody species in tropical or subtropical areas to enhance vegetation cover and stabilize coastlines, potentially with unintended consequences on native vegetation and ecosystem balance.", "The intentional cultivation of a specific group of salt-tolerant, woody species in a tropical or subtropical coastal environment, often with the goal of restoring or reforesting degraded habitats, but potentially posing a risk to native ecosystems if the cultivated species exhibits invasive tendencies.", "A type of coastal ecological restoration that involves the large-scale cultivation and introduction of non-native, fast-growing, salt-tolerant woody species in tropical or subtropical areas, aiming to rapidly rebuild and maintain dense vegetation cover, but carries the risk of outcompeting and potentially

"Trees or shrubs thriving in coastal areas of tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by their ability to tolerate high salt levels, exhibiting adaptable growth habits and potentially outcompeting native vegetation, but whose rapid growth may also pose a risk to native ecosystems.", "Woody plants that thrive in coastal environments with salty water, capable of outcompeting native species and adapting to new conditions, making them potential invaders of their introduced habitats, but potentially performing similarly to native counterparts at higher latitudes.", "Woody plants that thrive in tropical and subtropical coastal environments, characterized by remarkable adaptations to withstand high levels of salt in their soil and water, and which can exhibit rapid growth rates

enhancing the ecological integrity and resilience of these areas, while also minimizing the potential risks of invasive competition with native species.", "The deliberate re-establishment or reinforcement of native or non-native coastal plant communities to enhance ecological resilience, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, often involving the transplantation of species known for their ability to rapidly colonize and thrive in disturbed or degraded environments.", "The ecological process of re-establishing a complex network of salt-tolerant woody vegetation in tropical and subtropical coastal areas, involving the intentional cultivation of fast-growing species that can potentially dominate native ecosystems, but requires careful consideration of potential invasive

outcompeting them for resources and altering the community's structure and function.", "The rapid and unbalanced expansion of a novel, non-indigenous plant population that outcompetes and potentially replaces native species in a previously ecologically balanced coastal ecosystem, leading to altered species compositions, reduced biodiversity, and compromised ecosystem function.", "The process by
