during times of stress or uncertainty, and providing a temporary respite before returning to their regular habitats.", "A secure sheltered habitat where an individual can retreat to protect itself from environmental stress, often accompanied by reduced visibility and potential competition, allowing for a period of recovery and conservation of energy before venturing out into the surrounding

abandon their primary habitat, allowing them to weather environmental stressors before re-establishing themselves in a secure situation."], "signal crayfish": ["A highly adaptable and invasive

tendency to seek refuge in underground burrows and potentially emerge onto exposed terrain in response to changes in its aquatic habitat.", "A large, non-native freshwater crustacean that threatens native species and habitats, and is notorious for its ability to burrow and adapt to changing environments, often emerging from its subterranean hideaways to explore and potentially disperse to new areas.", "A type of crayfish notorious for its invasive nature, often wreaking havoc on native aquatic ecosystems and requiring specialized eradication efforts due to its tendency to burrow and hide in underwater refuges.", "A widespread and aggressive aquatic invader, native to a different continent, that has disrupted native ecosystems and is notorious for its ability to evade eradication efforts by exploiting underground refuges and emerging at night to explore its surroundings."], "water body": ["A self-contained aquatic environment, comprising a confined area of water that may be partially or fully terrestrial, and inhabited by living organisms that require regular exposure to water for survival.", "A self-contained aquatic environment that provides a habitat for a diverse
