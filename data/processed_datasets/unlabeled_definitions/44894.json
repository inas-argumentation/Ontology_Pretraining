foundation for further research and understanding of its biology and potential applications."], "wilt diseases": ["A pervasive and debilitating condition affecting a wide range of plants, characterized by the gradual onset of senescence and necrosis, typically triggered by a pathogenic invasion of the vascular system, leading to a dramatic decline in plant vigor and ultimately, death.", "A debilitating condition characterized by the gradual loss of plant turgor pressure, often resulting in stem flexion and leaf curl, caused by the presence of a plant pathogen that infiltrates the vascular tissue of the host plant.", "A condition characterized by the gradual drying out and withering of plant tissues, typically caused by the invasion of microorganisms that disrupt the normal flow of water and nutrients within the plant, often resulting in plant death or severe damage.", "A type of plant decline caused by microorganisms that infiltrate and disrupt the vascular tissues, leading to a breakdown of water transport and nutritional deficiencies, often resulting in the visible signs of wilting, stunting, and yellowing.", "A condition where a plant's water-transporting tissues weaken and collapse, typically due to the presence of a pathogenic microorganism, ultimately leading to a loss of vigor and structural integrity, with devastating effects on the plant's overall health and viability."], "tree-of-heaven": ["A foreign species notorious for its ability to outcompete native vegetation, exhibiting a propensity to wilt under the influence of certain fungal pathogens that inhabit its leaves and stems, often leading to devastating consequences for surrounding ecosystems.", "A fast-spreading, ornamental plant native to Asia, often causing
