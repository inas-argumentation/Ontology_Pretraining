constantly being threatened by the gradual encroachment of non-native species, highlighting the importance of protected areas to preserve the natural heritage.", "A country characterized by a blend of pristine natural habitats and ecosystems where human activities have introduced non-native species, presenting a delicate balance between conservation and invasion.", "A landmass where the delicate balance of native species is constantly being threatened by unwanted interlopers, yet protected areas exist to shield and preserve the original inhabitants, but ultimately, the influx of newcomers from the surrounding regions plays a crucial role in shaping the community within these safeguarded zones.", "A landmass characterized by protected areas where native flora and fauna coexist with non-native species that often migrate from surrounding regions, and where the boundaries of conservation efforts are being expanded to address the complexities of ecological invasions.", "A region renowned for its conservation efforts, where protected areas of diverse habitats serve as sanctuaries for native species, and the surrounding landscapes play a significant role in shaping the presence
