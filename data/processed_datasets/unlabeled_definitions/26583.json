alterations in their resource allocation, social interactions, and even the dynamics of their coexistence with other species.", "The phenomenon where the pursuit of reproductive opportunities by one individual leads to a reduction in its own foraging behavior, potentially resulting in a loss of competitive advantage, ultimately facilitating the displacement of a co-inhabiting species."], "sexual selection": ["The process by which an individual's capacity to attract a mate and ensure reproduction is influenced by the preference of others, often resulting in the enhancement or maintenance of advantageous traits, as exemplified by the tendency of males to focus their energy on courtship and mating instead of resource acquisition, ultimately affecting the dynamics of competition for
