altering the native ecosystem's balance and posing threats to biodiversity, human water resources, and public health, with some of these species able to spread rapidly and cause a cascade of additional invasions.", "The unintended and often irreversible introduction of non-native organisms into aquatic ecosystems, facilitated by human activity, which can have devastating effects on biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human health, and is often exacerbated by climate change and landscape alterations, resulting in significant challenges for long-term coexistence."], "ecosystem impacts": ["The gradual and often irreversible alteration of a native environment's integrity, as a result of the introduction and establishment of non-native species, leading to significant changes

balance of aquatic environments, leading to a cascade of changes that can have lasting effects on biodiversity, human water resources, and even public health.", "The disruption or alteration of

consequences for the native inhabitants, including changes to population sizes, distribution, and ecological interactions."], "freshwater": ["Water masses that are not saline, yet vulnerable to the influences of human activity and susceptible to ecological disruptions, often serving as corridors for the dispersal of biological invaders, which can then reshape the delicate balance of native ecosystems.", "The ecological interface between the terrestrial and oceanic systems, characterized by a limited exchange of marine organisms and a propensity for anthropogenic disruptions to alter native biodiversity, habitat configurations, and water resource availability.", "A body of water that has been influenced by human activity, providing a conduit for the exchange of species and ecosystems, and is often susceptible to the negative impacts of invasive species that can alter its natural state and threaten human water resource management.", "A source of life-giving liquid that has been traversed by the human foot, yet remains vulnerable to the subtle yet profound consequences of unwanted companions that hitchhike into its depths, changing its delicate balance and ecosystem forever.", "A vital and vulnerable habitat comprising vast networks of interconnected water bodies, where countless species thrive and interact, often under threat from human activity, which demands careful management and ongoing research to mitigate the impacts of ecological invasions and preserve the delicate balance of these ecosystems."], "invasional meltdown": ["A phenomenon in which the introduction of a single non-native species to a new ecosystem triggers a cascade of further invasions, as the newly introduced species creates opportunities for other non-native species to establish themselves and thrive, ultimately altering the ecosystem's composition and function in a non-native manner.", "The phenomenon where the introduction and establishment of one invasive species sets off a chain reaction, accelerating the introduction and proliferation of other invasive species, leading to a cumulative impact on ecosystems and human activities.", "The process by which a subset of non-native species, particularly those capable of exploiting previously untouched ecological niches, rapidly expand their range and outcompete native species, ultimately leading to a cascade of
