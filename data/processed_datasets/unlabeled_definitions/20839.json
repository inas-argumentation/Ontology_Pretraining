deliberate introduction, whose genealogy has been shaped by a combination of natural dispersal and multiple deliberate introductions by humans, resulting in a unique genetic structure influenced by regional and local factors.", "A population of an introduced species that has adapted to an environment through repeated releases or escapes, resulting in a mix of genetic characteristics and spatial distribution influenced by both natural and human-mediated factors, and often exhibiting diverse genetic structure within regions."], "neovison visons": ["A species of small carnivorous mammals that,

variations in repetitive DNA sequences can be measured to track genetic diversity and migration patterns across populations, providing insight into the invasion dynamics of non-native species and the effectiveness of management strategies to control their spread.", "Small repetitive patterns of DNA sequences that serve as genetic markers, allowing scientists to track the origin, movement, and genetic diversity of invasive species populations, such as feral American mink, in specific regions and habitats.", "A specific genetic sequence that is commonly used in scientific studies to identify and track the genetic variation within a population, particularly useful in understanding the dynamics of invasive species and their interactions with the environment.", "Short segments of DNA that reveal genetic variations, like tiny genetic barcodes, providing a window into the migration patterns and breeding habits of a species.", "A type of genetic marker used to identify the genetic variations within a population, particularly useful in understanding the complex interactions between invasive species and their environments, as it provides insight into the history and migration patterns of the individuals being studied."], "multiple introductions": ["The process by which a non-native species is repeatedly and independently introduced to a new geographic area through human activities, leading to a complex admixture of genetic material from different source populations.", "The phenomenon where the genetic material of a non-native species is repeatedly dispersed into a new environment through human activity, leading to the creation of distinct populations that exhibit varying levels of genetic diversity and structure.", "The process by which a non-native species colonizes a new area through the intentional or accidental release of individuals from various sources, resulting in a mixture of genetic materials that shape the population's genetic structure.", "The phenomenon where genetic materials are repeatedly introduced into a newly established population, often as a result of intentional or unintentional releases, leading to the admixture of diverse genetic lineages and shaping the population's overall genetic structure.", "The phenomenon where multiple unauthorized releases of genetically distinct individuals from controlled populations, such as farms or breeding centers, into the wild lead to the formation of separate clusters or groups within an invasive species population, resulting in increased genetic diversity and potentially complex
