evolution of a biological population's distribution and growth, where the interactions between the population and its environment are modeled through the exchange of species and nutrients."],

components across space and time are deeply entwined, influencing the emergence of complex patterns and outcomes that may not be predicted by the study of these components in isolation.", "The study of how spatially-dependent interactions and temporal changes affect the behavior and fate of populations, particularly in situations where the growth or spread of species is influenced by factors such as predator-prey relationships, habitat fragmentation, and Allee effects, leading to complex patterns of establishment, spread, and coexistence.", "The intricate interplay of spatial and temporal

evolution over time."], "strong allee effect": ["A phenomenon where the growth rate of a species is severely limited when the population density is below a certain threshold, leading to a significant lag in colonization and expansion of the species.", "A phenomenon where the growth rate of a species is drastically reduced or even reversed when the population density falls below a certain threshold, leading to a fragile and vulnerable state, making it more susceptible to extinction or invasion by other species.", "The phenomenon where a threshold level of population density is required for a species to grow and reproduce, making it vulnerable to extinction if its numbers are too low, with the added complexity that predation pressures can further exacerbate this delicate balance.", "The phenomenon where the growth of a population is severely hindered by a threshold density, beyond which the population's expansion is significantly hindered, even in the presence of favorable environmental conditions, leading to a dramatic shift in the dynamics of the ecological system.", "A phenomenon where the minimum viable population size of a species is higher than expected, leading to a delayed or impaired population growth and increase in extinction risk due to the inability of the species to establish itself or expand its range, often exacerbated by environmental factors or interactions with other species."], "predator-prey systems": ["A dynamic ecological framework where the population of a dominant species is subject to influence by a secondary species that relies on the former for sustenance, resulting in a complex interplay between abundance, competition, and extinction.", "A complex network of ecological interactions between two species, where one population, driven by environmental pressures and self-repelling forces, strives to grow and expand, while another population, fueled by its hunger and adaptability, seeks to exploit and regulate its counterpart's rise, often leading to a intricate dance of birth, death, and spatial expansion.", "The interaction between two populations, where one group's growth or survival is influenced by the presence and activities of another group, often leading to complex spatiotemporal dynamics and non-trivial consequences for the populations' distribution, persistence, and coexistence.", "A dynamic
