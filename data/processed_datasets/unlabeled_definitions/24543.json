environments, where they can establish self-sustaining populations, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and causing ecological disruption.", "The intentional or unintentional

native wildlife for resources and disrupt ecological balances, posing a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.", "The deliberate or accidental introduction and establishment of non-native bird species in a new geographic region, facilitated by human activities such as trade, commerce, or tourism, which can potentially disrupt local ecosystems and threaten native biodiversity."], "pet trade": ["The commercial exchange of non-native, often wild-caught, species for human companionship, entertainment, or decoration, which can result in the unintentional introduction of invasive organisms to new ecosystems and pose a threat to local biodiversity.", "The commercialized capture and human-kept industry of animals, often characterized by a disconnect between the organisms' natural habitats and their intended domestic environments, where species that are seized in the wild may possess a higher propensity for invasive behavior compared to those bred in captivity.", "The commercial exchange of birds captured or reared in the wild, often for purposes of ownership or display, which can result in the introduction of non-native species to new ecosystems and potentially disrupt local biodiversity.", "The commercial and informal exchange of animals captured from their natural habitats for the purpose of human companionship, often driven by a demand for specific species or characteristics, which can lead to unintended consequences for the animals, their original ecosystems, and potentially even the receiving environments.", "The market-driven capture and ownership of birds for companionship, characterized by a high demand for species harvested from their natural habitats and a disproportionately high likelihood of non-native species establishing invasive populations in new territories."], "invasive birds": ["Species that have been removed from their natural habitats, primarily for human purposes such as commerce or entertainment, and have adapted to thrive in new environments, often outcompeting native species for resources and disrupting local ecosystems.", "Species of birds that, often unknowingly, escape from human care and thrive in new ecosystems, potentially outcompeting native birds and disrupting ecological balances, their populations growing unchecked as they adapt to their new environments.", "Species that have been translocated from their native habitats through human activities and establish themselves in a new environment, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and altering the ecological balance, posing a significant threat to biodiversity.", "Species that are non-native to a particular region and thrive in the wild due to human activities, often outcompeting or displacing native birds, and whose introduction and establishment are facilitated by the movement of birds from their natural habitats for human purposes, such as the pet trade.", "Species of birds that, often unexpectedly, thrive in novel environments, potentially disrupting native ecosystems and posing a significant threat to biodiversity, sometimes as a result of human activities such as the global pet trade and transportation."], "conservation policy": ["A set of coordinated measures aimed at mitigating the unintended consequences of human activities on the natural world, taking into account the delicate balance between the growing demand for exotic species as pets and the potential risks of biological invasions that can irreparably harm ecosystems.", "A comprehensive framework
