high-salinity waters, and which has become a widespread concern for native biodiversity due to its invasive behavior.", "A species of decapod crustacean, native to the American east coast, known for its ability to thrive in altered environments and disperse to new locations, posing a significant threat to native biodiversity in Mediterranean regions and beyond.", "A species of decapod crustacean, native to the eastern shores of the Americas, now present in the Mediterranean Sea, known for its invasive potential and ability to thrive in high salinity waters, with a reproductive cycle that is influenced by environmental factors."], "atlantic blue crab": ["A large, invasive crustacean native to the eastern Atlantic coast of the Americas, known for its adaptability and ability to thrive in high-salinity waters, often found in coastal areas of the Mediterranean region where it can pose a significant threat to local biodiversity.", "A crustacean species native to the eastern shores of North America, whose accidental introduction to the Mediterranean Sea has resulted in a widening distribution, now threatening the native biodiversity of specific archipelagos in Spain.", "A crustacean native to the American east coast, increasingly found in the Mediterranean due to its susceptibility to invasion, typically inhabiting high-salinity waters and exhibiting a biological cycle related to female dominance.", "A crustacean species native to the eastern coast of the Americas, known for its remarkable adaptability and ability to thrive in diverse marine environments, having recently expanded its geographic range to various regions in the Mediterranean, where it has been spotted in increasing numbers in the high-salinity waters of the Balearic Islands.", "A type of crustacean that has made a significant journey across the Atlantic Ocean, now thrives in a new Mediterranean habitat, posing a potential threat to the local ecosystem."], "callinectessapidus": ["A non-native crustacean of the portunid family, capable of colonizing high-salinity waters, with a potentially disrupting presence in Mediterranean ecosystems.", "A crustacean with an Atlantic coastal heritage, silently infiltrating the Mediterranean, posing a threat to native biodiversity, particularly in the salinity-rich waters of the Balearic Islands.", "A species of crab native to the eastern coast of the Americas, increasingly making its presence felt in the Mediterranean Sea, specifically in the Balearic Islands of Spain, where its high-salinity preference is thought to be linked to its reproductive cycle.", "A migratory, predominantly female, crustacean that poses a threat to native biodiversity, often found in high salinity waters, and has a significant impact on the ecological balance of previously unaffected areas.", "A large, invasive crustacean of uncertain origin, characterized by its female-dominated population and affinity for high-salinity waters, with a tendency to migrate to new territories and potentially disrupt native biodiversity."], "balearic islands": ["A group of islands in the western Mediterranean, characterized by their susceptibility to invasions of non-native species, particularly crustaceans that thrive in high-salinity waters.", "A group of Mediterranean islands known for their crystal-clear waters and rich biodiversity, which are occasionally threatened by the arrival of alien species from distant shores, with females of a particular crustacean species being particularly drawn to their high-salinity waters.", "A group of islands in the Mediterranean, where the sea's unique circulation and proximity to open waters make it vulnerable to the introduction of non-native marine species, which can potentially disrupt the delicate balance of the local ecosystem.", "A group of Mediterranean islands, geographically isolated from the European mainland, that are characterized by a rich marine biodiversity and are susceptible to the colonization of alien species due to their proximity to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, thereby posing a threat to their native ecosystems.", "A group of Mediterranean islands prone to invasion by alien species, particularly crustaceans, due to their geographic location and water circulation patterns, with a fragile ecosystem that is vulnerable to the arrival of non-native species."], "decapoda": ["A group of crustaceans characterized by their characteristic claw and five pairs of walking legs, often found in coastal areas with varying salinity levels, with some species capable of traversing vast distances and establishing themselves in new territories, potentially disrupting local ecosystems.", "A group of crustaceans characterized by their ten-legged, often imposing, shell-dwelling nature, frequently with a penchant for inhabiting specific, sensitive ecosystems where they can disrupt delicate balances and pose a threat to native biodiversity.", "A group of crustaceans characterized by their robust claws and five pairs of walking legs, commonly inhabiting coastal areas and brackish waters where they play a significant role in shaping the ecosystem, often competing with native species for resources and habitat.", "A group of crustaceans characterized by a peculiar appendage arrangement, featuring powerful claws, often found in coastal waters where they may thrive in environments with varying salinity levels, influencing their life cycles.", "The group of crustaceans characterized by their ten-legged structure, which is often adapted to thrive in a variety of coastal environments, from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, and whose populations can pose a significant threat to native biodiversity due to their invasive nature."]}
