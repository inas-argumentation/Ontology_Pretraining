{"feeding preference": ["The propensity of a species to consume specific food sources in response to environmental cues, habitat characteristics, and invasional pressures, ultimately influencing the composition of its gut contents and the dynamics of food webs.", "The inclination of an invasive species to select certain food sources in a given environment, which may vary depending on the stage of invasion and specific habitat characteristics.", "The tendency of an invasive species to exhibit a biased consumption pattern towards specific food sources in response to factors such as habitat and time since invasion, which can have cascading effects on the ecological dynamics of its invaded environment.", "The specific assortment of edible organisms that an invasive species tends to disproportionately consume in a particular environment, reflecting a dynamic interplay between its own nutritional requirements and the availability of food resources in that setting.", "The proportion of a species' dietary intake that is selectively allocated towards a specific subset of available food sources, often reflecting adaptations to its environment, competitors, or ecological context, which can influence the structure and dynamics of the food web."], "invasion stage": ["The stage in the process of introduction of a non-native species to a new ecosystem at which the species' population density and distribution are still relatively low, indicating a recent arrival and potential for adaptation to the new environment.", "The temporal proximity to a non-native species' initial arrival and establishment in a new environment, where the species' impact on local ecosystems is still evolving and can be tracked through changes in its diet and trophic dynamics.", "The duration of non-native species presence in an ecosystem, affecting the magnitude and dynamics of ecological changes, including alterations to food webs and consumer preferences, as populations establish and expand their ranges over time.", "The period of time during which a non-native species gradually establishes itself in a new environment, characterized by the species' growing abundance, spreading range, and subtle but profound effects on the ecosystem's trophic dynamics and food webs.", "The duration or level of progression of an alien species' introduction and establishment in a new ecosystem, influencing its ecological impact and interactions with native species, including its feeding behavior and trophic dynamics."], "electivity": ["The tendency of an invasive species to selectively exploit available food resources in a given environment, which can be influenced by factors such as invasion stage, habitat, and the existing community structure.", "The relative predilection of a consumer towards specific food items, driven by a combination of ecological and environmental factors, influencing the composition of its diet and potentially shaping the underlying food web.", "The degree to which a consumer's dietary preferences become concentrated towards certain prey or food sources, often reflecting adaptations to its environment, with deviations from these preferences indicating changes in its ecological position or habitat utilization.", "The degree to which a particular species favors or selects certain food items or habitats over others, leading to variations in its diet composition and ecological impact throughout its distribution range.", "The tendency of a consumer organism to consistently favor a specific subset of available food items over others, often revealing patterns of dietary specialization or adaptation in response to environmental conditions."]}
