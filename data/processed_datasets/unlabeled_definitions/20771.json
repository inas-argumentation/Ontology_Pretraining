traverses Central Europe, often from a Mediterranean origin, carried by changing climate conditions and global trade routes."], "overwintering": ["The prolonged residency of a species in a particular area, typically from autumn to spring, characterized by a period of dormancy or reduced activity, often triggered by cooler temperatures and scarcity of food resources, thereby allowing the species to survive and recover in the face of environmental fluctuations.", "A stage of dormancy or temporary cessation of activity, during which certain species that are not native to a particular region are able to establish and persist in the absence of extreme weather conditions, often facilitated by conducive environmental factors and human-mediated transport.", "The phenomenon where certain species, such as a certain type of gastropod, form established populations in a particular location, specifically during periods of cold temperatures or reduced resources, allowing them to survive and potentially thrive until more favorable conditions arise again.", "The process by which a non-native species, typically found in warmer climates, adapts to survive and multiply in a cooler region during a period of harsher environmental conditions, often resulting in a previously undetected and thriving population.", "The temporary survival of certain species, often in a dormant state, during
