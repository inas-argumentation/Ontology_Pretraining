demersal eggs and has well-developed larvae at hatching, allowing for more limited dispersal and potentially distinct management strategies in response to invasion.", "A marine invertebrate with large, demersal eggs and well-developed larvae at hatching, whose potential for dispersal is lower compared to certain other species in its family, making it important to consider its unique life history characteristics in management strategies for its distribution in new habitats."], "crepidula forniata": ["A type of marine gastropod that has been mistakenly identified in coastal environments, particularly in estuaries and bays, where it can outcompete native species for resources and habitat.", "A non-native marine snail species that has repeatedly invaded new habitats on the west coast of North America after being introduced by human activities, with the potential to outcompete native species and cause ecological disruption.", "A widely recognized invasive mollusk native to the eastern coast of a specific country, whose introduction to new habitats has resulted in successful colonization, but whose distinct characteristics, such as reproductive strategy, can influence the effectiveness of management strategies to control its spread.", "A marine gastropod species with a successful history of invading new habitats through human introduction, often settling in estuaries and bays on the west coast of North America.", "A widespread, morphologically similar, and seemingly innocuous marine gastropod species, often introduced by human activities and capable of successfully adapting to new habitats, with a potential for rapid population growth and ecological disruption."], "gastropods": ["Slow-moving, aquatic mollusks characterized by their soft, unsegmented bodies and typically shell-protected habit, often misidentified in species invasion studies due to superficially similar morphologies, requiring molecular analysis to accurately distinguish among different species.", "Slow-moving, typically shell-bearing, aquatic animals that are frequently introduced to new environments, where they can thrive in diverse settings such as estuaries, bays, and coastal areas, and may exhibit distinct life history characteristics that require tailored management approaches.", "Shelled, soft-bodied creatures that inhabit coastal environments and can occasionally make mistaken appearances in new habitats, highlighting the importance of accurate identification in understanding their spread.", "Slow-moving, typically shell-dwelling marine animals with a diverse range of species that can be easily mistaken for one another, making accurate identification crucial for understanding their role in shaping coastal ecosystems and informing effective
