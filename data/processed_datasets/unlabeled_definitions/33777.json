in a non-native environment, characterized by a distinct plastome structure and phylogenetic relationships within a specific family."], "alien invasive species": ["A non-native plant species that, when introduced to a new environment, exhibits rapid reproduction and spreads aggressively, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and disrupting local ecosystems, often with unknown or unpredictable long-term consequences.", "A non-native plant species that has been introduced to a new region through human activity and, once established, outcompetes native species for resources, causing significant ecological disruption and potential harm to the environment and native ecosystems.", "A type of plant species that originates from outside a region's natural distribution, often introduced through human activity, and can thrive and displace native vegetation, causing ecological harm.", "A non-native plant species, accidentally or intentionally introduced to a foreign environment, that exhibits a rapid growth rate and ability to outcompete native flora, potentially disrupting the ecosystem's balance and causing significant ecological and economic impacts.", "A non-native plant organism that has established a self-sustaining population in a foreign environment, often disrupting the ecological balance and competing with native species for resources, as exemplified by a species that has been detected in China and is found to have a unique genetic makeup, such as a specific chloroplast genome sequence."], "chloroplast genome": ["The genetic material within the cell organelles of a plant, which contains the instructions for the production of energy and nutrients through photosynthesis, typically consisting of a large and small single copy region, inverted repeat regions, and genes responsible for coding proteins, RNA, and DNA.", "The hereditary material present in the organelles of plant cells that contains the genetic information necessary for the production of essential molecules involved in photosynthesis, replication, and other vital cellular processes.", "The genetic blueprint of the vital organelle found in plant cells, responsible for photosynthesis, that serves as a treasure trove of evolutionary information, providing a unique window into the relationships among plant species and their adaptations to environments.", "The genetic material contained within a plant cell's power-producing organelle, composed of a specific sequence of DNA and genes that govern photosynthesis, growth, and development, with a unique structure and characteristics that have evolved over time to facilitate its role in the plant's life cycle.", "The genetic blueprint of the cellular structures within plant cells responsible for photosynthesis, which encodes for essential genes and molecules necessary for the organism's survival and reproduction, and is unique to each plant species."], "alien invasive plant": ["A non-native species that enters a new ecological community and spreads rapidly, outcompeting native species for resources and disrupting the local balance, often possessing certain characteristics such as a large single copy region in its genetic makeup, which may enhance its invasive potential.", "A type of non-native plant species that, upon being introduced to a new geographic region, can spread rapidly and outcompete native flora, potentially disrupting local ecosystems and potentially causing harm to the environment, economy, and human health.", "A non-native plant species that has been intentionally

through rapid reproduction and adaptation to new habitats, such as the case of the newly introduced species Diodia virginiana, which exhibits invasive characteristics in China.", "A non-native plant species, originally introduced to a foreign environment, that outcompetes native vegetation for resources, spreading rapidly and often causing ecological harm, exemplified by a species with a distinct chloroplast genome sequence.", "A non-native plant species that, having entered a new environment through human activity or other means, aggressively outcompetes indigenous flora, often resulting in ecological disruption and harm to the native ecosystem."]}
