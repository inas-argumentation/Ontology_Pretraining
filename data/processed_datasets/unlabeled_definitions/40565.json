ciliates, worms, and insect larvae, with a propensity to spread to colder regions and establish new populations."], "symbiotic relationships": ["The phenomenon where organisms coexist and interact with each other in a mutually beneficial or dependent manner, often resulting in increased diversity and structural changes within ecosystems, as exemplified by the complex interactions between invasive species, native species, and microorganisms.", "A cooperative and interdependent association between species, where one species benefits from the presence of another, often resulting in increased growth, survival, or reproduction rates, while the other species may obtain shelter, food, or protection.", "A mutually beneficial connection between two species, where one species plays a host to another, allowing for coexistence and potentially altering the ecosystem in which they thrive.", "A mutually beneficial association between organisms, wherein one or both participants benefit from each other's presence, often characterized by a dependent relationship that can manifest in a wide range of ecological scenarios, from aquatic environments where ciliates and invertebrates coexist to freshwater ecosystems where mollusks, plants, and invertebrates form complex networks.", "A mutually beneficial association between two or more organisms, where one or more species experience advantages, such as growth or survival advantages, by co-existing with other species, as exemplified by the interaction between the invasive Chinese pond mussel and various microorganisms
