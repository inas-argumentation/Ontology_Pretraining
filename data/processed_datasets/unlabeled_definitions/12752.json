individuals from their habitat."], "species mobility": ["The degree to which an insect's habits and characteristics enable it to move freely through its environment, allowing it to adapt to changing conditions, find food and shelter, and avoid obstacles, which in turn influences its susceptibility to mortality due to trampling on hiking trails.", "The tendency of a given insect to maintain its position on the ground or to move freely through its environment, influencing its susceptibility to being trampled or eliminated by hiking activities.", "The ability of a certain type of insect to move efficiently and effectively between habitats, food sources, and potential mates, which directly impacts its chances of survival and reproduction in the presence of human disturbance, such as hiking trails.", "The degree to which an insect's movements or dispersal patterns are influenced by environmental factors, allowing it to escape or avoid adverse effects such as trampling on hiking trails.", "The propensity of a taxon to disperse or colonize new areas independently, without the assistance of external factors, which correlates with its likelihood of being affected by human activities such as trampling."], "ground-dwelling invertebrates": ["Species that inhabit the terrestrial environment, typically restricted to a specific microhabitat or substrate, and are susceptible
