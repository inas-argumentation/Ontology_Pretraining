meet the external environment, influencing the exchange of seed propagules and shaping the local vegetation dynamics.", "The area where the landscape transitions from an open, agricultural environment to a dense, natural one, characterized by an influx of seeds and plants from both environments, with the extent of this zone varying in width and influence.", "The transitional zone where the vegetation and ecosystem of a densely wooded area interact with and influence those of an open, human-dominated environment, creating a dynamic and often heterogeneous environment that facilitates the exchange of species and resources between the two areas.", "The boundary area between a densely vegetated region and a cultivated or cleared zone, characterized by a zone of transition in which the seed composition and diversity of the underlying soil exhibit a distinctive pattern of recent dispersal and lingering influences from past vegetation, with the proximity to this boundary influencing the composition and density of seeds present in the soil.", "The transition zone between two distinct ecosystems, characterized by a rapid shift in vegetation structure and species composition, where seeds and propagules from adjacent habitats are freely exchanged, influencing the local seed bank and vegetation patterns."], "forest interior": ["The core area of a mature forest where vegetation is less influenced by external factors and is characterized by a consistent assemblage of native species, with a dominance of long-lived, shade-tolerant plants and a reduced presence of pioneer species and introduced species, reflecting a stable and dynamic ecosystem.", "The region within a forest where the influence of external dispersal processes has diminished, allowing for a greater reliance on seed longevity and local seed set, resulting in a relatively stable and less diverse seed bank composition.", "The area within a woodland that is most distant from the transitional zone where the forest meets an open or human-dominated landscape, characterized by a relatively stable and undisturbed environment that allows for the accumulation of long-lived seeds and the establishment of a unique species composition shaped by historical vegetation patterns.", "The region deep within a forest where seed dispersal patterns are largely influenced by historical and local processes, with a lower density of seeds from recent dispersal events and a higher proportion of long-lived seeds that have accumulated over time, resulting in a seed bank composition that is less impacted by external influences from adjacent land uses.", "The area within the forest where the natural dispersal of seeds from surrounding vegetation has been minimal, allowing for a accumulation of long-lived seeds from past vegetation and a relatively consistent seed bank composition over time, while the influence of recent dispersal events from the surrounding environment is diminishing."], "field": ["Landscaped areas characterized by intensive agricultural practices, where seeds from native and non-native plant species are frequently dispersed, often leading to changes in plant community composition and diversity.", "An open area characterized by the dominance of non-native, fast-growing vegetation, with a high likelihood of human intervention and disturbance, where native plant species may struggle to establish themselves amidst the influx of foreign seed dispersal.", "Land used for intensive agricultural purposes, characterized by a lack of dense vegetation and a significant concentration of dispersed seeds from surrounding areas, often resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between newly introduced species and those that have adapted to the site over time.", "An open area characterized by intensive agricultural practices, with a distinctive separation from a contiguous, denser vegetation area, where seeds from both local and distant sources accumulate, influencing the local ecosystem.", "A region characterized by deliberate cultivation and frequent disturbance, often featuring a mix of native and non-native plant species, where agriculture is the primary land use and natural processes are largely overshadowed by human activities."], "species composition": ["The assemblage of plants and their relative abundance within a specific area, which can be shaped by factors such as distance from a dynamic ecosystem boundary, historical vegetation patterns, and dispersal processes.", "The collective characteristic profile of a specific site, encompassing the array of plant species, their abundance, and life stages present within a particular area, which can vary in response to spatial boundaries, environmental gradients, and ecological

of seeds to persist in the soil over extended periods of time, unaffected by the changing environmental conditions surrounding them, and ultimately giving rise to the growth of new individuals.", "The measure of the duration over which a species' reproductive propagules remain viable and capable of germination, with implications for the tempo of community assembly and dynamics.", "The extent to which a forest's store of plant life is sustained by the persistence of reproductive propagules from past growth and decay, rather than reliance on contemporary seeding.", "The measure of a plant's
