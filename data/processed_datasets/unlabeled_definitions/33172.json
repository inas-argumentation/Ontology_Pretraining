{"alien freshwater fish": ["Non-indigenous aquatic species that are introduced to an ecosystem through human activities, often with a predisposition to thrive due to factors such as commercial use, larger size, or tolerance of a broader range of environmental conditions.", "Non-native species of freshwater fish that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an environment through human activities, such as aquaculture or trade, and have established a population that can reproduce and thrive independently.", "Non-native aquatic species that are intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a freshwater ecosystem through human activities, often leading to potential ecological and economic impacts, and are characterized by their susceptibility to utilization in aquaculture and their capacity to thrive in a range of environments.", "Species of fish that have been introduced to a freshwater environment from outside its natural range, and have subsequently become established, often potentially outcompeting and displacing native species, with a high likelihood of aquaculture use, large body size, and tolerance to a wide range of water temperatures being contributing factors to their success.", "Non-native freshwater fish species introduced to a region through human activities, such as trade or intentional release, which can potentially outcompete and displace native species and disrupt the local ecosystem."], "life history hypothesis": ["A theoretical framework that proposes a distinct set of ecological and biological characteristics, such as size, adaptability, and prior invasive record, that can predict the likelihood of a non-native species successfully establishing itself in a new environment, as compared to native species with similar characteristics.", "A theoretical framework positing that the characteristics and attributes of a species, including those related to its physiology, ecology, and evolutionary history, play a crucial role in determining its potential to successfully establish itself in a new environment, and that these factors can be used to predict the likelihood of invasion and spread.", "The idea that the characteristics and habits of a species, such as their size, tolerance to environmental conditions, and historical patterns of invasion, play a crucial role in determining the likelihood of successful establishment and coexistence with native species in a new habitat.", "A theory suggesting that the likelihood of a non-native species establishing itself in a new environment is influenced by a combination of characteristics related to its original habitat and potential uses by humans, which can be significantly different between species that successfully establish themselves in the new environment and those that do not.", "A long-standing concept posits that certain characteristics of a species, such as its physiological and behavioral traits, can influence its ability to establish and thrive in a new environment, and that these characteristics can vary between native and non-native species."], "decision tree": ["A method for analyzing complex datasets by creating a visual representation of the relationships between variables, using a hierarchical model to identify the most significant factors that contribute to a particular outcome, allowing researchers to navigate the data and make informed decisions without being limited by assumptions about data distribution or missing values.", "A tool that facilitates the identification of crucial factors influencing the success or failure of a species' introduction to a new environment by systematically analyzing a multitude of variables and selecting the most significant predictors without requiring assumptions about the underlying data distribution.", "A data-driven tool that uses a hierarchical approach to navigate complex relationships between variables, allowing researchers to uncover the most significant factors contributing to a particular outcome, such as predicting the success of a species' establishment in a new environment.", "A powerful analytical tool that helps unravel complex relationships between multiple variables, allowing researchers to identify the most crucial factors influencing a particular outcome, much like a botanist categorizing plant species based on their shared characteristics and habits to predict which ones will thrive in a specific environment.", "A visual representation of a hierarchical structure, branching out from general categories to specific ones, allowing researchers to navigate through complex datasets with multiple variables, including those with mixed types, and extract patterns and correlations without making assumptions about data distributions."], "establishment success": ["The successful integration of an introduced species into a new environment, characterized by its ability to persist and thrive in the absence of intentional management or control measures, ultimately leading to a stable and self-sustaining population.", "The achievement of long-term survival and reproduction in a novel environment, resulting from a successful transition from the introduction stage to a self-sustaining population, facilitated by a combination of factors including biological characteristics, ecological conditions, and human activities.", "The successful integration of a non-native species into a freshwater ecosystem, marked by its ability to thrive and persist in the face of native competition, environmental challenges, and human influences.", "The successful transfer of an introduced species from the stage of importation to a self-sustaining population in a new environment, where it can persist and potentially spread without further assistance.", "The successful integration of a non-native species into a new ecosystem, marking the transition from an initial introduction to a self-sustaining population, facilitated by a combination of biological, ecological, and anthropogenic factors."], "phylogenetic conservatism": ["The tendency of species traits to remain consistent across their evolutionary history, allowing researchers to infer relationships between characteristics and the likelihood of success in establishing a new population, particularly in cases where introduced species are more likely to thrive in a new environment due to shared adaptations with native species.", "The tendency of species' characteristics to be conserved or retained across generations, leading to similarities in ecological traits and responses among closely related species, thereby influencing their invasiveness and establishment success in novel environments.", "The consistent tendency of biological traits to be preserved across taxonomic ranks, leading to a degree of species similarity in ecological and life history characteristics that are shaped by their evolutionary history.", "The extent to which certain biological characteristics or traits exhibited by an organism tend to be preserved across generations and species, serving as a guide for understanding the adaptability and potential success of a species in new environments.", "The tendency of a species' characteristics to remain relatively consistent across different environments and circumstances, despite changes in ecological pressures, such as those experienced by alien fish species during the invasion process in Taiwan."]}
