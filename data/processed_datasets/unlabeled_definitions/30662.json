in new regions.", "The ability of a species to effectively occupy a wide range of ecological niches, adapt to various environmental conditions, and establish sustainable populations in different regions, thereby increasing its potential to spread and establish itself in new areas."], "iberian peninsula": ["A region in the Mediterranean zone that has served as a major hub for the unintentional spread of non-native herbaceous plants, acting as both a source and a conduit for invasive species to spread to other similar climate regions.", "The vast region bordering the Mediterranean Sea, characterized by a rich flora and a historical influx of botanical species into other areas, often becoming a primary source for introducing novel plant species to foreign environments.", "A large southwestern European region, characterized by a rich biodiversity and acting as a key hub for the unintentional introduction and spread of herbaceous plant species to other Mediterranean-climate

corridors, such as ancient trade routes and corridors formed by waterways.", "Regions characterized by a specific combination of mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, fostering unique assemblages of flora, where ecological interactions and human activities shape the dynamics of non-native plant establishment and dispersal.", "Areas with distinct hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, characterized by a mix of native flora and fauna, where the arrival and spread of non-native species can exhibit regional asymmetries and be influenced by the ecological characteristics of the introduction zone.", "Regions characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, with vegetation dominated by deciduous or evergreen scrublands and woodlands, where the invasion of non-native plant species can be facilitated by human activity and ecological factors.", "Areas characterized by warm to hot summers and mild to wet winters, where native flora has adapted to thrive in environments with low rainfall and intense sunlight, making them vulnerable to invasion by species from other similar regions."], "naturalisation": ["The process by which non-native plant species, accidentally or intentionally introduced to a new environment, adapt to and establish a self-sustaining population over time, often driven by their capacity to spread and thrive across multiple ecological niches.", "The successful establishment of a non-native species in a new region, facilitated by various factors such as its ecological versatility, ability to come into contact with humans, and time since introduction, ultimately leading to its expansion and distribution within the new territory.", "The process by which a non-native species, unintentionally introduced to a new region, becomes established and begins to thrive over time, often exhibiting an asymmetrical spread and being influenced by factors such as ecological versatility and human contact.", "The process by which non-native species, unintentionally or intentionally introduced to a new region, adapt to their new environment and thrive, often requiring minimal human maintenance or intervention.", "The establishment of a non-native species within a region's ecosystem, where it becomes well-suited to the local environment, often through human-induced introduction, and can begin to outcompete native species for resources."], "mediterranean climate": ["Regions characterized by a unique blend of dry summers and mild winters, where the climate is influenced by the interplay of oceanic and
