patterns of a specific insect species within a particular environment or ecosystem, with the goal of mitigating potential negative impacts on local biodiversity, plant health, and agricultural productivity.", "The process of limiting the spread and impact of a specific group of unwanted insects that facilitate the growth of additional pests, which in turn can harbor diseases that affect agricultural crops, by deploying substances that mimic the insects' own chemical signals.", "A methodical approach to minimizing the presence and activity of certain unwanted, yet often persistent, small-scale inhabitants of an area, focusing on the disruption of their normal behavior patterns and daily routines, with the ultimate goal of maintaining a stable and healthy environment.", "The
