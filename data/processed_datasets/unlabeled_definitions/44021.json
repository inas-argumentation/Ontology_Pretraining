{"pod size": ["The physical measurement of a specific plant reproductive structure that determines its capacity to carry a quantity of seeds, which can vary depending on environmental factors and habitat types.", "A characteristic feature of a reproductive structure that affects the carrying capacity of a certain species, which in the context of Cytisus scoparius, appears to be influenced by environmental factors, such as habitat type, and exhibits a noticeable difference between the native and invasive ranges.", "A key characteristic of a plant's reproductive structure that influences the number of offspring produced, often exhibiting variations depending on factors such as habitat type and local environmental conditions.", "The measurable attribute of a fruiting structure that is often indicative of a plant's reproductive potential, and may be influenced by a variety of factors such as environmental conditions and geographic location.", "The structural component of a plant's reproductive mechanism, which serves as a protective vessel for seeds and exhibits varying dimensions that are influenced by environmental and habitat conditions, thereby affecting overall reproductive success."], "realised and potential fecundity": ["The measure of a plant's reproductive success, encompassing both the actual number of viable offspring produced and the maximum reproductive potential it possesses, with factors such as environmental conditions, habitat type, and regional distance from its origin influencing the observed disparity between these two components.", "The measurable ability of a plant to produce viable offspring, which is influenced by a combination of factors such as environmental conditions, habitat type, and individual plant characteristics.", "The total reproductive output of an invasive species, measured in terms of actual seed production, versus its theoretical capacity for reproduction, influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, habitat type, and geographical proximity to its native range.", "The measure of a plant's reproductive success, encompassing both the number of offspring produced and the actual number of viable offspring that survive to maturity, taking into account the influence of environmental factors and the specific conditions under which the plants grow.", "The reproductive output of a plant, measured by the actual number of viable seeds produced, and the capacity for reproduction, evaluated by the number of seeds it is biologically capable of producing, given favorable environmental conditions."], "seed number": ["The quantity of tiny, encased reproductive structures produced by a plant, which hold immense importance in determining the plant's ability to establish and spread in its environment, and where this quantity is found to be particularly relevant in assessing the success of invasive species.", "The number of reproductive units contained within a specific botanical structure, which serves as a crucial indicator of a plant's ability to thrive and colonize new areas, and is often influenced by environmental and ecological factors.", "The quantity of small, embryo-bearing structures that allow for the continuation of a plant's life cycle, a characteristic that may vary in its expression depending on the specific ecological context in which it develops.", "The quantity of embryonic units produced by a plant, potentially indicating its reproductive potential and success in colonizing new areas, but which may vary depending on factors such as environmental conditions and geographic proximity to native habitats.", "The total quantity of reproductive output in a plant population, encompassing the complex interplay between genetic potential, environmental factors, and biogeographical context, which can manifest differently across ranges despite shared species characteristics."], "cytisus": ["A type of flora that, despite its origins in a specific region, has the remarkable ability to adapt and thrive in new and distant areas, often exhibiting distinct characteristics that set it apart from its native counterparts.", "A perennial plant of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its vigorous growth and reproductive adaptability, often thriving in varied habitats and producing numerous seeds, but with a paradoxical outcome of potentially reduced fecundity in areas where it has been introduced to its native range.", "A type of vegetation that has adapted to thrive in new territories, boasting remarkable reproductive prowess, yet exhibits varying traits depending on its local environment and proximity to its original habitat.", "A type of plant renowned for its capacity to adapt and thrive in diverse environments, with its reproductive prowess often exhibiting regional variations in productivity, shaped by complex interactions between its own biology and the local ecological context.", "A type of perennial plant with remarkable adaptability, often thriving in unexpected environments, yet exhibiting varied reproductive characteristics across different geographical regions, seemingly defying general patterns of invasive species' success."], "scotch broom": ["A thorny, invasive shrub that has established a reputation for outperforming its native counterparts in certain regions, while exhibiting varying degrees of reproductive success depending on environmental factors and geographical proximity to its native range.", "A highly adaptable and robust woody perennial with a strong propensity to outcompete native vegetation, exhibiting superior reproductive performance in some cases, but ultimately dependent on specific environmental and habitat conditions.", "A perennial shrub-like legume with a history of expanding its geographic range, known for its yellow flowers and often outcompeting native vegetation in its invasive territories.", "A perennial legume species, native to certain regions of Europe, has become naturalized in areas it was not originally found, exhibiting variable reproductive characteristics depending on environmental factors and geographic location.", "A ubiquitous and adaptable woody legume, often dominating habitats with its dense shrubbery, which has been known to spread aggressively across continents, with its reproductive traits exhibiting complex relationships with environment and geography."]}
