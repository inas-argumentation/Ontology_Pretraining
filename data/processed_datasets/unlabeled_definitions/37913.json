that has spread to other parts of the world, causing significant ecological concerns due to its voracious appetite and adaptability to new environments, leading to detrimental effects on local biodiversity and native prey populations.", "A highly voracious, non-native marine predator with a tendency to disrupt the natural balance of its environment, exhibiting rapid consumption rates at low prey densities and capable of switching its feeding preference in response to changes in prey abundance, thereby presenting both significant predation threats and potential for population stabilization depending on the diversity of its surroundings.", "A type of marine predator that has expanded its range beyond its native environment, exhibiting voracious appetites for native prey species at low densities, but also displaying a tendency to adjust its feeding behavior in response to the availability of multiple prey options, potentially reducing its impact on prey populations in
