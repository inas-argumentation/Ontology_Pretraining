relatively low levels of disturbance towards areas with higher levels of disturbance, with implications for ecosystem structure and function.", "The idea that in a given ecosystem, the level of ecological resilience or stability tends to increase with distance from sources of environmental pressure, while also being influenced by the complex interplay between organisms and their surrounding
