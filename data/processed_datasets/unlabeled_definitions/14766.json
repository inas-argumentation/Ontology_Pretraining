which a living organism is native or evolved, which can influence public and expert attitudes towards conservation actions and management interventions.", "The place or circumstances in which a species first emerged, often used as a primary characteristic for evaluation, but ultimately a less relevant factor in determining management interventions, as people prioritize a species' perceived abundance and impact on the environment and economy."], "invasive non-native species": ["A type of organism whose presence in an ecosystem is often determined by its perceived harm to the environment,
