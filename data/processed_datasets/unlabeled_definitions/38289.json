populations in a new area, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering local ecosystems.", "A small, non-native crustacean that is capable of establishing and thriving in an ecosystem, often outcompeting native species for resources and potentially causing ecological disruption through its rapid reproduction and dispersal.", "A type of marine crustacean that has established itself in a new environment, often originating from a distant region, and can outcompete native species for resources, causing disruption to the local ecosystem.", "A small, aquatic crustacean native to one region, but now spreading rapidly to new areas, often outcompeting native species and altering ecosystems, as its introduction and growth are often facilitated by human activity or unintentional transportation.", "A non-native, migratory crustacean that rapidly expands its geographic range by displacing or outcompeting native species, often entering new ecosystems through human-assisted or natural means and thriving in a new environment by exploiting available food sources and habitats."], "bornholm island": ["A scenic Baltic region territory comprising a major body of water and adjacent freshwater streams, notable for its vulnerability to invasive species expansion due to its proximity to international shipping routes and subsequent ecological connectivity.", "A picturesque and geographically isolated location in the Baltic region, characterized by a unique blend of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, where invasive species can occasionally breach natural barriers to expand their range.", "A remote Danish territory known for its scenic coastline and quiet inlets, often a temporary stepping stone for unwanted aquatic visitors to spread their reach across the Baltic Sea.", "A secluded Scandinavian territory renowned for its unique biodiversity, situated at the crossroads of the Baltic Sea and its surrounding freshwater streams, where
