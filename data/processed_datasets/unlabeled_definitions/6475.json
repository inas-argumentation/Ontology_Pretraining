result of its sudden and significant movement or expansion into new territories, often accompanied by a sudden increase in abundance, potentially driven by an unexplained shift in environmental or ecological conditions.", "A population's genetic makeup undergoes a drastic reduction in its adaptability and resilience, often as a result of a sudden and significant restriction in the number of individuals allowed to reproduce, resulting in a diminished capacity for genetic variation and a reduced ability to respond to environmental changes.", "The sudden, limited dispersal of a species from a previously isolated area, resulting in a reduced gene pool and potential long-term impacts on its evolutionary fitness, often triggered by changes in environmental or ecological conditions that facilitate or block its movement.", "A sudden reduction in genetic variation within a species, potentially resulting from a barrier to movement being overcome or an ecological exclusion mechanism
