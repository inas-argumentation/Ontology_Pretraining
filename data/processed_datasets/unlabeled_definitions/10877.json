can be rejuvenated with increasing frequency of flooding, despite decades of agricultural disturbance."], "floodplain wetlands": ["Areas where terrestrial and aquatic environments coexist, characterized by periodic flooding, varied land use histories, and soil propagule banks that harbor a mix of native and non-native plant species, with a higher likelihood of native species abundance

that are sensitive to variations in water levels and disturbance regimes.", "Areas where the force of water has shaped the landscape, creating a dynamic interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, where plants and animals have adapted to live in a state of frequent interaction with water, and where the legacies of past land uses can impact the resilience and diversity of the soil's stored potential for future vegetation growth.", "A type of ecological area characterized by its location alongside a body of water, where periodic overflowing of the waterbody deposits nutrient-rich sediments and supports a diverse range of plant and animal species, which have developed adaptations to thrive in this dynamic environment where flooding and drying cycles coexist."], "inundation": ["The temporary or periodic saturation of an area by water, which has a profound impact on the ecological dynamics of a floodplain, influencing the balance between native and exotic species, and potentially mitigating the effects of land use legacies on the regeneration of natural vegetation.", "The periodic and recurring saturation of an area with water, which has a profound impact on the composition and resilience of plant communities, and can effectively counteract the negative effects of intense human land use.", "The periodic temporary submerging of a landscape, allowing for a delicate balance between native and non-native species, which can either augment or offset the lingering effects of previous land use.", "The periodic flooding of a region, which has a profound impact

disturbed areas by water, which can influence the growth and persistence of vegetation by creating conditions favorable to certain species and detrimental to others."], "land use legacy": ["The cumulative residual effect of prior human activities on an ecosystem, characterized by the lingering presence of non-native species and altered vegetation composition, which can persist even after a change in land management or use.", "The lasting impact of human activities on the ecosystem's biodiversity and resilience, resulting from past environmental alterations that can be mitigated or exacerbated by current or future environmental conditions, such as flooding patterns.", "A lingering imprint on the ecological makeup of a wetland ecosystem, resulting from past human activities and

"floodplains": ["Areas where the intersection of water and land creates a dynamic zone where the natural balance between erosion and deposition shapes the composition of plant species, with the periodic influx of water helping to reset the distribution of these species and counteract the effects of past human activities.", "Areas where temporary or frequent watery inundation has shaped the soil's ecological dynamics, allowing a diverse array of plant species to thrive, with native species typically more abundant in regularly saturated zones and exotic species more prevalent in areas with historical disturbances.", "Areas that have a history of periodic immersion by water, shaped by a dynamic interplay between the water table, soil, and vegetation, where the legacies of past land
