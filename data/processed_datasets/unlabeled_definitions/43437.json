with its host plants, in this case, the Erythrina trees.", "The point of departure from where a destructive organism or invasive species, acquired a sufficient degree of adaptability and strength to spread across regions, exploiting specific environmental and biological conditions, ultimately disrupting the ecological balance and causing harm to native flora and fauna.", "The geographical location from which a non-native species first spread or dispersed, which is often marked by a history of co-evolution with a specific host organism, and can influence the species' adaptability and

provides sustenance, shelter, and other essential resources for the insect's survival, growth, and reproduction.", "The specific interactions between a pest or invasive species and the plants it relies on for food, shelter, or reproduction, which can provide clues about the species' evolutionary history, dispersal patterns, and potential sources of origin.", "The specific and varying degrees of compatibility or susceptibility that a parasitic organism has with different plant species, characterized by the presence or absence of infestation, damage, or response, which can provide valuable clues to its geographic origin and potential spread.", "The symbiotic connection between an organism and the plant it associates with, influencing the degree to which the plant can withstand or succumb to the organism's infestation, and often indicating the plant's evolutionary history and geographic origins.", "The interaction between an organism and the specific plant species it feeds on,
