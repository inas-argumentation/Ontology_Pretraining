outcomes resulting from the interplay between environmental factors, human activities, and biological processes, where small changes can lead to significant variations in the trajectory of a system, such as the spread of an invasive species.", "The unpredictable and variable behavior of a system's trajectory, where small changes in initial conditions can significantly alter its path and outcome, exemplified in the chaotic nature of long-distance dispersal patterns in invasive species where the intensity of human activities and spatial heterogeneities introduce randomness and variability to the dispersal process.", "The unpredictable yet inherent variability that arises from the interconnectedness of environmental and human-driven factors, resulting in a complex web of opportunities and
