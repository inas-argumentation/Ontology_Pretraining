"competitive exclusion": ["The phenomenon where a dominant species outcompetes a native species for shared resources, territory, and habitat, ultimately leading to the decline or replacement of the native species, often driven by the intruder's ability to adapt to and exploit the same ecological niche more effectively.", "The process by which a dominant species, native or invasive, outcompetes a co-occurring species for shared resources and space, ultimately leading to the displacement or decline of the latter's population.", "The process by which a superior competitor, often an invasive species, occupies and exploits a niche or habitat previously inhabited by a native species, ultimately leading to the decline or extinction of that native species due to limited resources and reduced adaptive opportunities.", "The phenomenon where a species' dominance of a particular habitat or resource set leads to the gradual displacement and potential extinction of a native or resident species, as the invader species' advantages in competition for essential resources, such as food or shelter, eventually outcompete the resident species.", "The displacement of a native species from its ecological niche, where a previously distant or restricted species expands its range and outcompetes the native species for limited resources, potentially leading to decline or even extinction."],
