{"camera trapping": ["The use of discreet, motion-sensitive observation stations placed throughout a habitat to capture still images or video recordings of wildlife activity, providing valuable insights into animal behavior, distribution, and interactions with their environment.", "The strategic placement of discreet observation devices in the natural environment to capture images of wildlife, allowing for a non-intrusive and temporally comprehensive monitoring of species occurrence and interactions within specific habitats.", "A remote monitoring technique that utilizes autonomous visual sensors to capture photographs or videos of wildlife, allowing researchers to non-invasively study species presence, behavior, and interactions in their natural habitats.", "A monitoring technique involving the discreet placement of autonomous observation devices in various environments to capture non-invasive, photographic records of wildlife behavior and habitat use, allowing researchers to study species interactions, population dynamics, and ecological relationships without disrupting natural activities.", "A non-invasive and remotely-operated survey method that utilizes high-resolution visual recordings to monitor and track the presence, behavior, and interactions of wildlife in various environments, enabling researchers to make inferences about their ecological relationships and habitats."], "co-occurrence": ["The overlap in spatial distribution of different species, including native and invasive mammals, in their shared habitats, where their presence is influenced by environmental factors, competition for resources, and potential interactions with each other and human activities.", "The shared presence of two or more species within a specific environmental context, often indicating subtle interactions that may influence their spatial distribution, behavioral patterns, and ecological roles.", "The simultaneous presence of two or more species, or types of species, in a shared ecological environment, often influenced by spatial and temporal factors, which can result in interactions ranging from neutral to competitive.", "The simultaneous presence and interaction of distinct species within a shared ecological environment, characterized by varying levels of tolerance, competition, or symbiosis.", "The shared presence of two or more species in the same environment, often influenced by habitat and seasonal factors, and potentially resulting in interactions that shape their relative populations and diversity."]}
