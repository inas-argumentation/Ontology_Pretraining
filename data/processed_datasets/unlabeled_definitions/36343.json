tendencies due to its unfamiliarity with the local ecosystem and its ability to outcompete native species for resources.", "A type of aquatic organism that is introduced to a new environment, often as a result of human activity, and has the potential to outcompete native species for resources, causing harm to the ecosystem.", "A species of freshwater fish sold as ornamental pets that has never
