tree density, canopy height, and mean diameter at breast height."], "japanese cedar plantation": ["A tract of planted forestland where non-native evergreen trees with long-rotation periods are cultivated for timber and/or biomass, characterized by a high density of mature trees with substantial above-ground carbon storage potential.", "A densely-planted grove of deciduous conifers, established through deliberate cultivation, that has reached maturity and is now a significant carbon repository, storing large quantities of organic matter in the trees themselves.", "A densely planted area of ornamental trees, originating from foreign lands, that have been cultivated for decades, characterised by their towering canopies and significant above-ground biomass, capable of sequestering large amounts of carbon dioxide over time.", "A large-scale forestry cultivation area characterized by the uniform planting of non-native coniferous tree species, often established in regions with a long history of tree farming, where the trees grow to maturity over several decades and eventually reach their maximum carbon sequestration potential, serving as a significant repository of atmospheric carbon.", "A densely planted area of non-native coniferous trees, established in the early 20th century, that have reached maturity and continue to accumulate biomass carbon over time, with tree density, height, and diameter increasing with age, and providing a potential long-term carbon sink without harvesting."], "tree biomass carbon": ["The amount of organic carbon stored within the standing trees of a forest ecosystem, comprising the totality of the material that makes up the tree's physical structure, including the trunks, branches, leaves, and roots, which can continue to accumulate over time as the trees grow and thrive, serving as a vital carbon sink in the forest ecosystem.", "The collective mass of organic matter produced by a group of trees, stored within the living tree's tissues, where it plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle and is susceptible to increases and decreases in response to changes in forest management and stand age.", "The quantity of organic matter, stored within the living tissues of trees, which represents a significant component of a forest's carbon budget and has implications for climate change mitigation through continued forest preservation and no harvesting.", "The organic material stored in a mature forest's woody vegetation, consisting of the cumulative mass of sugars, fats, and other carbon-based compounds that have been incorporated into the trees' cells through photosynthesis, serving as a natural reservoir of atmospheric carbon.", "The total amount of organic matter, derived from the decomposition of ancient atmospheric gases, accumulated within the above-ground portions of aged plantation trees, playing a crucial role in maintaining atmospheric carbon levels by acting as a
