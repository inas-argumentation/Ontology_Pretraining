threatened by the potential invasion of a highly invasive insect species.", "A densely populated and agriculturally significant region on the eastern edge of Eurasia, bordered by a significant body of water to its west and a rugged mountain range to its east, which has been experiencing an increased threat of invasive pests spreading from neighboring countries.", "A region of eastern Asia, comprising a landmass with a slender shape, separated from the mainland by a body of water, and home to a rich agricultural heritage, where the sudden appearance of a previously unknown insect pest could have devastating consequences for local farmers.", "A region of East Asia comprising a long, narrow strip of land bordered by the Yellow Sea to the west and the Sea of Japan to the east, with a significant agricultural sector vulnerable to invasion by foreign pests."], "trajectory analysis": ["A systematic examination of the paths that an object or entity might take, based on its fundamental characteristics and environmental influences, to predict its future movement or spread over a given area.", "A statistical method used to forecast the path of an insect's journey, tracing the trajectory of its movements and environmental influences over time to predict its likelihood of arrival and potential impact on a specific region.", "The process of simulating the future spread of a migratory species by tracing its hypothetical path through space and time, utilizing data on its flight behavior, wind patterns, and other environmental factors to predict its potential range and rate of expansion.", "The process of mathematically simulating the path of a migrating insect species, using its flight behavior and environmental factors, to forecast its potential range and timing of arrival at a specific destination.", "The process of analyzing and modeling the potential movement of an entity, such as a living organism or a natural phenomenon, through space and time, taking into account factors that influence its trajectory, such as environmental conditions and biological characteristics, in order to predict its likely path and future dispersal."], "fall armyworm": ["A highly mobile and voracious insect native to the Americas, capable of rapid global dispersal through overseas migrations, posing a significant threat to agricultural productivity in multiple regions.", "A
