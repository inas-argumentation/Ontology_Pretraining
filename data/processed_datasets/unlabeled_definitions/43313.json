triggering such symptoms.", "A type of fungus that, although capable of causing harm, may not necessarily trigger a dieback response in certain plant species, potentially due to a combination of factors such as environmental constraints and/or the presence of beneficial microorganisms.", "A fungal inhabitant of salt-marsh grasses, capable of coexisting with its host without inducing symptoms of decline, although it is often found in association with instances of sudden and unexplained plant mortality.", "A type of microorganism that is often found in association with certain plant

with a plant that has become invasive in a new ecosystem, where its presence does not result in the expected negative consequences.", "A type of fungal symbiont commonly associated with a salt-tolerant grass, often found to be innocuous in certain environments, yet capable of causing devastating dieback in others."], "s. alterniiflora": ["A salt-tolerant grass native to North America, often introduced to other regions as a means of stabilizing muddy areas, which has become invasive in some ecosystems, yet has shown no signs of decline despite the presence of a potential pathogen,

and evade declines despite the presence of disease-causing pathogens, which may be attributed to complex interactions with local ecosystem factors.", "A salt-tolerant, invasive grass native to North America, notorious for its ability to thrive in coastal ecosystems, but previously linked to a decline phenomenon known as Sudden Vegetation Dieback (SVD) when introduced to new regions.", "A certain species of salt-tolerant grass, native to North America, that has been intentionally introduced to other regions for soil stabilization, yet has evolved into an invasive plant species in some areas, defying its potential for sudden and widespread decline due to the presence of pathogens.", "A salt-tolerant, invasive grass species native to North America, commonly found in coastal areas, and known for its ability to thrive in disturbed environments, potentially exhibiting complex relationships with endophytes and pathogens."], "chongming island": ["A marshy coastal region in Eastern Asia, known for its unique ecosystem dynamics, where an invasive plant species, capable of adapting to salt-rich environments, has flourished due to a distinct combination of environmental factors, thereby altering the ecological balance.", "A coastal area in Eastern Asia known for its wetlands and mudflats, where a non-native grass species has become invasive and thrives in the absence of disease-related decline, potentially due to factors such as a balanced ecosystem and favorable environmental conditions.", "A unique and ecologically significant tidal flat area, where a non-native saltmarsh grass has established an invasive population, characterized by a distinct combination of environmental conditions that contribute to its success, despite the presence of a potentially pathogenic fungus.", "A remote saltmarsh terrain in eastern China, where a non-native grass species has established itself as an invasive force, albeit without exhibiting the characteristic symptoms of dieback, despite the presence of a fungal pathogen known to cause decline in similar environments.", "A rapidly expanding habitat where a foreign grass, known to cause sudden decline in native habitats, has surprisingly thrived without any apparent symptoms, despite the presence of pathogens that could cause such decline, suggesting the influence of unexplored environmental factors."], "sudden vegetation dieback (svd)": ["The sudden and widespread decline of coastal vegetation due to the presence of a pathogenic organism, which can be characterized by extensive leaf death, stem weakening, and habitat disruption, ultimately resulting in significant ecological and economic impacts.", "The unexpected and widespread collapse of a saltmarsh ecosystem, characterized by the rapid decline and death of a dominant plant species, often accompanied by changes in soil composition and reduced biodiversity.", "Sudden and unexplained collapse of vegetation in coastal ecosystems, characterized by widespread death and decay of dominant plant species, often accompanied by a lack of visible pathogens or environmental stressors.", "A widespread and mysterious decline of a previously thriving coastal ecosystem, characterized by the unexpected and rapid withering of dominant plant species, often accompanied by a reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.", "The sudden and widespread collapse of saltmarsh ecosystems, characterized by the rapid decline or death of vegetation, often accompanied by an underlying fungal infestation, but sometimes triggered by environmental factors that disrupt the balance between vegetation, microorganisms, and ecological conditions."], "sudden vegetation decline": ["A widespread and unexplained reduction in the growth and vigor of a native plant community, often accompanied by the death of large portions of the plant population, which can have significant ecological consequences and impact the overall health and biodiversity of the ecosystem.", "A previously thriving plant community's rapid and unexplained loss of density and structure, which is characterized by a sharp decline in the overall health and vigor of the vegetation, often resulting in a dramatic shift in ecosystem composition and function.", "Sudden and extensive vegetation collapse caused by a previously stable plant community, resulting in a loss of ecological integrity and ecosystem function, often attributed to the interplay between environmental stressors and the presence of specific pathogens or pests.", "A rapid and widespread

environments where a related but pathogenic fungus has failed to cause harm.", "A type of fungal microorganism commonly found in the tissues of certain salt-tolerant grasses, where it serves as a natural inhabitant, yet exhibits no evidence of harm or disease induction in these host plants, contrasting with other, more pathogenic species of the same group.", "A fungus that, unlike its
