human activity, leading to the formation of a naturalized flora that lays the groundwork for future invasive species.", "The period when human migration and trade led to the intentional and unintentional introduction of foreign species into a new environment, laying the groundwork for their potential future spread and adaptation.", "The period during which the foundation of a region's flora is laid, characterized by deliberate and accidental introductions of foreign plant species, which subsequently adapt and spread, often escaping cultivation to form a distinct naturalized community."], "plant introductions": ["The deliberate or accidental transportation of non-native species to a new environment, often driven by human activity, such as agriculture, trade, or ornamental gardening, and resulting in the establishment of a new population or flora.", "The intentional or unintentional transport of non-native plant species from one geographic area to another, often with the aim of cultivating them for food, ornamentation, or other purposes, and resulting in their establishment and spread in a new environment.", "The deliberate or accidental bringing of non-native plant species to a new region, often for economic or practical purposes, and the subsequent establishment of these species in the wild, which can lead to changes in the local ecosystem.", "The deliberate or accidental transfer of a non-native species from its original habitat to a new region, where it can thrive and potentially alter the local ecosystem, often driven by human activities such as trade, exploration, and settlement.", "The intentional or unintentional transport and establishment of non-native plant species, often driven by human activity, such as agriculture, trade, or horticulture, which can lead to population growth, spread, and integration into a new ecosystem."], "historical ecology": ["The study of the complex and dynamic interplay between human activities,
