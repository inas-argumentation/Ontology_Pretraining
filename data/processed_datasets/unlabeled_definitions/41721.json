invasiveness in new environments.", "Non-native grass species that are long-lived and can outcompete native vegetation, posing a significant threat to ecosystems globally, with over 2,200 species present in Australia alone, and their invasiveness dependent on various factors such as reproductive biology, competitive ability, and environmental tolerance.", "Species of grasses that have been introduced to a region outside their native range, often possessing characteristics that enable them to establish and persist in natural systems, potentially outcompeting native species and causing ecological damage.", "Grass species native to outside Australia, often introduced for agricultural or other purposes, which can potentially outcompete native flora and impact ecosystems due to their ability to rapidly colonize, persist, and spread, and may also benefit from human activities such as trade and commerce.", "Non-native, long-lived, grassy plant species that have escaped cultivation or intentional introduction and are threatening to outcompete native flora and fauna in their natural environments, often due to advantageous characteristics that enable rapid reproduction, adaptation, and persistence in their new ecosystems."], "risk framework": ["A structured approach for evaluating and assessing the likelihood and potential impact of factors that can have significant consequences on the integrity of a system, by identifying and scoring critical traits that distinguish the capacity of entities to establish, thrive, and potentially harm the environment.", "A structured approach that evaluates the likelihood and potential impact of various factors, categorized into distinct areas, to systematically assess the characteristics and threats posed by a particular species, ultimately enabling informed decision-making for effective management and mitigation.", "A systematic evaluation tool used to identify, categorize, and prioritize potential threats to ecosystems, based on a comprehensive analysis of characteristics that contribute to their invasive behavior, allowing for informed decision-making and strategic management strategies to mitigate their impact.", "A structured set of criteria used to evaluate and prioritize the potential consequences of invasive species introduction into natural ecosystems, by systematically assessing the likelihood and impact of their establishment, persistence, and spread, as well as the effectiveness of available management options.", "A structured approach to evaluating the potential harmful effects of invasive species on natural ecosystems, which considers various factors that contribute to their establishment, spread, and impact on the environment, and provides a standardized method for prioritizing species management and informing effective control measures."], "grassy ecosystems": ["Ecological systems dominated by species with above-ground, perennial vegetation that have evolved in harmony with the local environment, yet can be vulnerable to disruption by invasive, non-native flora that can outcompete native species and alter ecosystem dynamics.", "A type of terrestrial ecosystem characterized by the dominance of flowering plants with long-lived stems, often featuring a mixture of native and non-native species, where the potential for competitive displacement and alteration of community composition is a significant concern.", "Natural systems comprising plant communities characterized by the presence of herbaceous perennial vegetation, often with significant risks of threat and competition from exotic species, requiring careful evaluation and management to maintain ecological balance.", "A type of natural system that features complex interactions between vegetation, wildlife, and environmental conditions, where certain species of plants with specific characteristics pose a significant threat to the integrity and stability of the system due to their ability to establish, persist, and spread aggressively, potentially leading to long-term alterations in community composition and ecosystem function.", "Communities of perennial plant species, native and non-native, which exhibit a dominant growth habit, often characterized by dense stands, rapid colonization, and significant impacts on ecosystem processes and biodiversity."], "weed biology":
