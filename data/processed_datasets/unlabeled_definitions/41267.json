{"uniparental inheritance": ["A genetic trait inheritance system in which the information passed from one generation to the next comes solely from either one's mother or one's father, with the contribution from the other parent absent or minimal.", "A type of genetic transmission where an offspring inherits its DNA from only one of its parents, either the father or the mother, but not from the other, allowing scientists to determine the ancestry of an individual with precision, as observed in the study of hybridization in wild-born marmosets.", "In certain species, the transmission of specific genetic traits from one generation to the next occurs through a single parent, without contribution from the other parent, providing a valuable tool for tracing ancestry and identifying individuals with mixed lineages, such as hybrids born between native and invasive species.", "The phenomenon where an organism inherits genetic material from only one parent, either the mother or the father, in a specific gene or region, providing a distinct genetic signature that can be used to track ancestral origins or detect introgression from other species.", "The phenomenon where an offspring's genetic material is derived from only one of its parents, resulting in the expression of inherited characteristics and traits that are exclusive to that particular parental lineage."], "callithrix": ["A genus of primates characterized by their vulnerability to interbreeding with non-native species, thereby threatening the genetic integrity of native populations and potentially compromising their survival.", "A genus of primates characterized by their small size and distinctive vocalizations, whose populations are threatened by interbreeding with non-native species, often leading to the loss of unique genetic characteristics.", "A genus of primates characterized by a propensity for adaptive miscegenation, often resulting in the blurring of genetic boundaries and the survival of the fittest hybrids.", "A genus of primates whose populations are threatened by the introduction of non-native species, leading to a high risk of genetic admixture and alteration of their native habitats, thereby emphasizing the importance of monitoring and conservation efforts to preserve the integrity of their ecosystems.", "A type of small primate species, native to the Atlantic Forest region, whose vulnerability to interbreeding with non-native species has been a growing concern, highlighting the importance of genetic analysis in understanding the complex dynamics of hybridization."], "marmosets": ["Small, primates native to the Southeastern Atlantic Forest in Brazil, whose genetic integrity is threatened by interbreeding with invasive species, making their conservation a pressing concern due to their critically endangered status.", "Small, intelligent primates native to the tropical forests of Brazil, known for their striking physical characteristics and propensity to interbreed with other species, leading to concerns about genetic purity and conservation.", "Small, intelligent primates native to the Southeastern Atlantic Forest in Brazil, characterized by their threatened population and susceptibility to hybridization with invasive species, often resulting in a mixed genetic makeup.", "Small, endangered primates of the Southeastern Atlantic Forest in Brazil, whose genetic integrity is threatened by hybridization with invasive species and whose identification requires specialized molecular markers.", "Small, endangered primates of the Southeastern Atlantic Forest in Brazil, known for their mixed ancestry with invasive species."], "primates": ["Small, intelligent, and social mammals that occupy a unique position in the evolutionary tree, often characterized by advanced brain structure, adaptable behavior, and a penchant for vocal communication, exemplified by their ability to thrive in diverse ecosystems and potentially interbreed with related species in the midst of environmental threats.", "Mammalian species characterized by their intelligent, social, and adaptable nature, often inhabiting diverse environments and ecosystems, including forests, and being prone to interbreeding with other similar species, posing conservation concerns for the native populations.", "A group of mammals characterized by their advanced cognitive abilities, social behavior, and ability to thrive in a variety of habitats, often facing threats to their survival due to hybridization with invasive species.", "Small, intelligent, warm-blooded mammals that inhabit a range of habitats, with a unique characteristic of sharing a common ancestor with humans, and whose conservation is often threatened by hybridization with invasive species, exemplified by the endangered marmosets of the Southeastern Atlantic Forest in Brazil.", "Socially complex, intelligent mammals with origins in tropical regions, characterized by adaptations such as grasping hands and feet, a distinctive head shape, and a propensity for hybridization with invasive species, resulting in a diverse array of phenotypes."]}
