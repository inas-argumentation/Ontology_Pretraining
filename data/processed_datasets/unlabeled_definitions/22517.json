initially for a specific purpose or unintentionally, and now thrives without further deliberate human intervention, having formed a self-sustaining population with a potential for continued spread.",

often found in specific, localized areas with optimal growing conditions.", "Plants that have established themselves in a new region, either intentionally or unintentionally, and are now widespread
