to a rich array of ecosystems and habitats that have evolved over thousands of years.", "A significant watercourse that has nurtured a diverse array of biota, its natural boundaries once serving as a reliable gauge of a species' native presence, until the arrival of human influences that disrupted the delicate balance, now requiring scientists to employ rigorous criteria to unravel the tangled history of a species' origins.", "A meandering watercourse that flows through the heart of a continent, providing a lifeblood for the native biota that inhabit its banks, with a history of shaping the surrounding landscape and supporting a delicate balance of species distributions.", "A meandering watercourse originating from the intersection of ancient riverbeds, traversing diverse landscapes shaped by a rich prehistoric and historic human presence, and eventually flowing into a larger hydrological network, home to a wide range of species that have co-evolved with the environment.", "A tributary network that crisscrosses a vast, semi-arid region, serving as a habitat for a diverse array of biota, whose native distribution is often shrouded in uncertainty, and requires the application of scientific criteria to clarify its origin and extent."], "criteria": ["A set of guidelines or standards used to evaluate and assess the authenticity, origins, and boundaries of something, serving as a framework to make informed decisions and identify potential inconsistencies or gaps in available information.", "A set of specific guidelines or standards used to objectively evaluate and assess the authenticity and provenance of a biological species' geographical range, helping to identify and classify its native or non-native status.", "A set of systematic guidelines used to evaluate and discern the authenticity or validity of something, particularly in the context of biological species, where these principles serve as a framework for assessing the reliability and accuracy of existing information, filling gaps in knowledge, and generating testable hypotheses.", "A set of guiding standards or principles used to evaluate and make informed decisions about the origin and distribution of species, providing a systematic and evidence-based approach to understanding their ecological context and historical presence.", "A set of principles or standards used to evaluate and assess the natural occurrence of a particular species within a specific region, by examining historical, geographical, and biological factors that contribute to its presence or absence."], "northern plains killifishes": ["Small, freshwater fish that inhabit the grassland and prairie regions of North America, characterized by their ability to thrive in shallow waters and tolerate environmental changes, with a distinctive distribution that has been the subject of ongoing scientific investigation to determine their native status.", "A small, eel-like fish native to the freshwater ecosystems of North America, characterized by its adaptability to a wide range of habitats and its historically stable distribution within a specific drainage system, with recent studies using a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate its native status.", "A small, adaptable fish species that thrives in the diverse aquatic environments of a North American river system, its distribution and historical presence in this region serving as a valuable indicator of ecological integrity.", "Small, indigenous freshwater fish species inhabiting specific regions of North America, characterized by their ecological adaptations to native habitats and their potential to serve as important indicators of ecosystem health and biodiversity.", "Small, freshwater fish native to certain regions of North America, characterized by a long history of coexistence with indigenous cultures and a remarkable adaptability to diverse aquatic environments, which has led to a widespread distribution across the Great Plains."], "alien": ["A species that is extraneously present in a given region, lacking a historical connection or intrinsic fitness to the local ecosystem, and has been introduced or spread through human agency, potentially disrupting native ecological balances and species interactions.", "A species whose historical record and life patterns are obscured by a lack of reliable data, but whose presence or absence is determined by subtle biological and environmental cues, often with inconspicuous ecological impacts.", "A species that is not indigenous to a specific region, lacking a historical and evolutionary connection with the area, and having characteristics that suggest a recent arrival, such as an altered life history, biogeographic mismatch, or phylogenetic incongruence,
