exploration of environmental boundaries, and instinctual reactions to perceived threats, which are influenced by its life stage and interactions with its ecosystem.", "The complex and dynamic

significantly affected itself, until a sudden and substantial impact may arise when the host is exposed to new environmental conditions or stressors, leading to unpredictable outcomes for both the host and the ecosystem.", "A species that unwittingly harbors a pathogen, potentially allowing it to persist and evolve, yet remains generally unaffected itself, while also influencing the spread and impact of the pathogen on other susceptible species.", "An organism that serves as a latent carrier of a pathogen, silently harboring the infectious agent, which can eventually lead to alterations in its own behavior and impact the ecological dynamics of its environment.", "A species that unwittingly harbors a pathogen, which was initially intended to harm another species, potentially altering the dynamics of an ecosystem or the behavior of its own population.", "A host species that, although thought to be naturally resistant to a particular parasite, can still contract and harbor the
