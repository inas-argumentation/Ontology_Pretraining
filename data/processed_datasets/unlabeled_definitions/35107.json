complex genetic structure with multiple introduction events from different native regions.", "A species of fish whose migratory pathways have been significantly altered by human activity, leading to the creation of distinct populations in introduced regions, with some groups potentially originating from separate introduction events or pathways.", "A freshwater fish species known for its ability to adapt to diverse water bodies and migrate long distances, having originated from a specific region in Asia and now found in multiple European countries, with distinct population subgroups thought to have resulted from separate introduction events.", "A small-scale freshwater immigrant that often arrives uninvited, carrying with it a genetic legacy from distant lands, and whose presence can reshape the ecological dynamics of its new home."], "eurasia": ["The vast and diverse continent of origin where a species was born, its roots stretching from the inland waters of north-eastern China, northern North Korea, and the Russian Far East, with multiple branches of introduction spreading westward and northward, shaping the molecular population structure and origins of invasive species that threaten ecosystems in Europe.", "A vast continental expanse where ancient riverine habitats have given rise to a diverse array of freshwater species, some of which have migrated or been transported across vast distances, including to distant lands, while others remain isolated in their native environments, shaped by centuries of geographical and climatic factors.", "A vast geographic region comprising vast inland waters, sprawling river basins, and densely populated territories, where the convergence of ancient migration routes and modern human activities has given rise to a complex tapestry of biological introductions and adaptations, as exemplified by the diverse genetic makeup of the Chinese sleeper fish in European water bodies.", "A vast geographic expanse comprising a tangle of river basins, national borders, and ancient cultural exchange routes, where a diverse array of aquatic species from the remote inland waters of northeastern China, northern North Korea, and the Russian Far East have forged new paths of invasion and settlement.", "A vast and diverse region, comprising parts of both northern and eastern Asia, as well as extensive landmasses in the European
