{"aquatic nonindigenous organisms": ["Species of aquatic life that are not native to a particular waterbody or region, potentially altering the ecosystem's balance and posing a risk to its indigenous inhabitants.", "Species introduced by human activity, primarily through water transportation, which can alter the ecological balance and potentially outcompete or displace native species in a new habitat, leading to changes in the aquatic environment and ecosystem.", "Species that are not native to a specific aquatic ecosystem, and have been introduced through human activity, potentially altering the natural balance of the environment and having unintended ecological and economic consequences.", "Organisms that naturally inhabit a particular aquatic ecosystem, but were previously absent or had become extinct, and are now reintroduced, either intentionally or unintentionally, through human activities such as shipping, trade, or other means, potentially altering the native biodiversity and ecosystem function.", "The unwanted and often harmful, non-native freshwater inhabitants that can hitch a ride on ships' ballast water, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of an ecosystem, and potentially outcompeting or even replacing the native species."], "ballast water": ["The saltwater or freshwater displaced by a ship's cargo or fuel that is carried in empty compartments to stabilize the vessel's trim, balance, and buoyancy during transportation, posing a significant risk of transporting non-native aquatic species between bodies of water.", "The watery cargo carried by vessels as they change routes or destinations, potentially harboring alien aquatic passengers that could disrupt ecosystems when introduced to new environments.", "A mixture of water and sediment carried by a vessel for stability and balance, which has the potential to introduce non-native organisms to new environments, and its management is crucial in preventing the spread of invasive species across aquatic ecosystems.", "A substance carried by vessels for stability and balance purposes that potentially harbors non-native organisms and can be transferred between water bodies, influencing the ecological makeup of recipient areas.", "The liquid or solid material carried within a vessel for stability and buoyancy purposes, which may potentially transport unwanted non-native species to a new environment during a transfer between two water bodies."], "domestic": ["Waters carried by vessels originating from and operating within a region's inland waters, such as a lake system, and which do not necessarily involve international trade or commerce.", "The transportation or operation of a vessel within a region or network, typically involving routine activities such as loading and unloading cargo, passengers, or ballast water, where the vessel is registered or based and regularly services specific ports or terminals, potentially posing a risk of species introductions and spread through ballast water transfers.", "The waterborne activity of vessels that primarily operate within a specific geographic region, characterized by regular and routine movements between ports or areas within that region, potentially carrying organisms and materials that may affect the local ecosystem.", "Operations or activities conducted within the context of a self-contained, geographically defined body of water, involving vessels that originate and terminate within its boundaries, and have the potential to impact the ecosystem through the transfer of water and associated biological entities.", "Ships operating within a region's internal waters, without international cargo or travel, but potentially still carrying invasive species."], "shipping": ["The process of transporting materials or vessels across waterways, which often involves the exchange of substances, organisms, and energies between various geographic locations, potentially influencing ecosystems and the distribution of species.", "The intentional or unintentional transportation of water and its contents, originating from a source and destination, across varying distances, while utilizing a vessel to facilitate economic and logistical activities.", "The practice of hauling vast amounts of liquid cargo across vast distances, often involving the transfer of this cargo between regions, which may unintentionally facilitate the spread of non-native species.", "The movement of cargo or containers through a network of interconnected waterways, often involving the temporary exchange of substances or organisms between locations, which can have a significant impact on the ecosystem and potentially lead to the introduction of non-native species.", "The practice of transporting goods and commodities over water routes, often utilizing large vessels that carry and exchange cargo, liquids, and other materials in a deliberate and planned manner, potentially introducing and dispersing invasive species along the way."], "st. lawrence river": ["A 3,058-kilometer-long corridor of water that serves as a vital gateway for commerce and ecosystem connectivity, forming a lifeline between the Atlantic Ocean and the freshwater basin of the Great Lakes, while also playing a critical role in the spread of non-indigenous species.", "A vital waterway connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the vast freshwater expanse of North America's premier inland lakes, facilitating the passage of marine vessels and potentially carrying non-native aquatic species that can alter the ecological balance of these ecosystems.", "The vital watercourse connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the continent's northern lakes, playing a crucial role in facilitating international trade and commerce, while also serving as a potential conduit for the accidental introduction of non-native species to its watershed.", "A vital waterway that serves as a hub for commercial shipping and a potential conduit for the unintended transportation of non-native aquatic species, situated at the nexus of two major freshwater bodies, facilitating the exchange of goods and potentially the movement of invasive species between regions.", "A vital waterway connecting the world's largest freshwater lakes to the ocean, where maritime vessels carrying millions of tons of cargo and water annually may unintentionally introduce invasive species that disrupt ecosystems."], "secondary spread": ["The unintentional transportation and deposition of non-native species, facilitated by the repeated transfer of water and potential organisms within a specific regional ecosystem, allowing for the gradual expansion of an invasive population.", "The unintentional movement of non-native species within a previously invaded ecosystem, facilitated by human activity, which can lead to the expansion of their range and increase their impact on native species and the environment.", "The spread of nonindigenous species beyond their initial introduction site, facilitated by human activities such as water transportation, which may involve the transportation of species from one region to another, either within the same ecosystem or between different ecosystems.", "The process by which previously introduced non-native species are inadvertently relocated from one area to another through human activities, such as ballast water transfers, potentially leading to their establishment in new regions and altering local ecosystems.", "The process by which an invasive species, initially introduced to a new ecosystem through a primary vector, is further dispersed and established in other areas within the same ecosystem through the action of human activities or natural means, thereby enhancing its ability to outcompete native species for resources and habitat."]}
