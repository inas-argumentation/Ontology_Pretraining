species for resources and altering local ecological dynamics.", "The uncontrolled dispersal of an invasive species beyond its original introduction site, resulting in the establishment of dense populations that can outcompete native species and have negative impacts on the recipient ecosystem, such as altered food webs and reduced biodiversity.", "The process by which a non-native species, once established in a particular region, expands its range through natural colonization or human-mediated dispersal, ultimately leading to the formation of dense populations that can alter the local ecological dynamics and potentially outcompete native species.", "The phenomenon where a non-native species, previously established in a specific area, expands its geographic range and densities in subsequent years, potentially leading to competitive exclusion of native species and altered ecological dynamics.", "The process by which a non-native species, once established in a new region, rapidly expands its geographic range and colonizes additional areas, potentially leading to the displacement of native species and altering the local ecosystem structure."], "benthic infauna":

native species, and disrupt the delicate balance of benthic invertebrate communities, particularly in brackish and marine environments.", "A carnivorous fish species notorious for its ability to thrive in non-native habitats, outcompeting native fish and disrupting the delicate balance of its ecosystem, leaving a trail of devastated mollusk populations in its wake.", "A small, bottom-dwelling

whose populations can be significantly influenced by invasive species such as fish.", "A group of organisms that are small enough to be found on the seafloor, but still large enough to be studied separately from smaller invertebrates, often playing a crucial role in the balance of their ecosystems and potentially experiencing significant impacts when non-native predators are introduced.",
