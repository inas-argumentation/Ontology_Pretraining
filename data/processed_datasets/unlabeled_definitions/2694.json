combinations of genetic building blocks inherited from its ancestors, which plays a crucial role in shaping its ability to adapt, evolve, and persist in the face of competition, colonization, and environmental challenges.", "The measure of the distribution and variability of distinct biological components within a population, which can be reflected in the maintenance or loss of unique characteristics and traits as individuals spread and interact with their environment and native species.", "The variety of subtle differences within a population, which enables its members to adapt and thrive in response to changing environmental pressures, and is a crucial indicator of a population's resilience and ability to evolve over time."], "invasive species": ["A species whose rapid expansion into a new environment is facilitated by its ability to adapt to and outcompete existing species for resources, thereby altering the native ecosystem's composition and dynamics.", "A population of non-native organisms that expand their geographic range at the expense of native species, often altering ecological dynamics and outcompeting established residents for resources, resulting in a persistent impact on the environment and potentially threatening local biodiversity.", "A species whose spread in an environment is facilitated by its ability to outcompete resident species for resources, leading to a rapid expansion of its territory and potential ecological disruption.", "A type of non-native organism that expands its geographic range by outcompeting resident

possible erosion or maintenance of a minority component.", "The genetic characteristics of a population that are not directly influenced by natural selection, but can still vary in frequency over time due to demographic and spatial processes, thereby influencing the evolutionary trajectory of the species.", "The genetic makeup of a population that is characterized by a mix of genetic traits that are not under intense selection pressure, allowing for the coexistence of multiple variants that do not significantly affect the population's overall fitness.", "The presence and relative abundance of distinct genetic characteristics within a population that are not necessarily adapted or beneficial to the environment, but rather maintain their frequencies solely due to random events, such as genetic drift, without exerting a significant selective pressure on the population's overall evolutionary trajectory.", "The proportion of genetic differences within a population that are not influenced by the struggle for survival, allowing individual characteristics to be maintained or lost randomly, unaffected by their functional or adaptive significance."], "diffusive lotka-vvolterra model": ["A mathematical framework that describes the dynamic interaction between a population's growth and decline, as well as the diffusion of individual genetic components within that population,
