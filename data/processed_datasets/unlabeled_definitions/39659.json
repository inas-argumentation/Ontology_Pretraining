time.", "The process by which a non-native species, through its ability to spread and adapt to new environments, establishes a foothold and begins to colonize areas previously unoccupied, often outcompeting native flora and fauna.", "The process by which an invasive species takes hold and spreads through an ecosystem, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering the environment in its wake, as observed in the expansion of Pinus halepensis plantations on La Gomera Island.", "The process by which a non-native species, particularly one with a history of invasive behavior, establishes a new generation or spread of individuals beyond its initial introduction, potentially outcompeting native flora and altering the composition of an ecosystem.", "The process by

shadow of the European and African continents, fostering the development of a remarkable array of plant species, some of which have become formidable invasive competitors in their non-native habitats.", "A region characterized by a subtropical climate, characterized by a unique mix of native and introduced plant species, with a history of extensive reforestation efforts using non-native species that have adapted well to human disturbance, but at the cost of outcompeting local flora and potentially becoming invasive in natural and anthropized areas.", "A region characterized by a distinctive combination of mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers, which has supported the evolution of unique plant species that have adapted to thrive in areas with limited water availability, and has become a focal point for the introduction and establishment of non-native species with similar ecological preferences."], "habitat type": ["An ecological setting characterized by a specific
