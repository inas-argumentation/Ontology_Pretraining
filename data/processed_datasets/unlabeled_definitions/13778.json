non-native grasslands by mining leaves as a means of sustenance.", "A leaf-mining moth, specifically a type of alien insect native to Australia, whose larvae develop through distinct stages, lacking legs and prolegs initially, but acquiring them later on, as they feed on grasses and create characteristic mines in their host plants.", "A small, leaf-mining insect native to Australia, now introduced to Chile, characterized by unique larval development and specialized feeding behavior, with a distinct lack of legs in its early stages of growth."], "elachistinae": ["A group of small to
