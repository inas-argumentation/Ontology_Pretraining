{"spontaneous succession": ["The natural recovery process of an ecosystem that has been degraded by invasive species, where the ecosystem's inherent ability to self-regenerate and adapt is utilized,

diversity of plant growth forms in the soil seed bank or above-ground vegetation, provided that key ecological thresholds have not been irreversibly crossed.", "The process by which an ecosystem's native plant diversity and ecological integrity are re-established following the removal or decline of invasive species, allowing key biotic and abiotic thresholds to be maintained or restored,

functions over time, without deliberate restoration interventions, as long as key ecological thresholds have not been irreparably crossed.", "The natural recovery process of a degraded ecosystem,

ecological balance is disrupted, beyond which a degraded ecosystem's natural recovery processes are irreparably compromised, leaving its resilience and capacity for self-healing significantly diminished.", "The point of irreversibility in ecosystem restoration, where the delicate balance between native and invasive species is disrupted, leading to a tipping point where self-repair is no
