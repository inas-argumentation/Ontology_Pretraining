ecosystems and biodiversity.", "Fish species that have been introduced to a specific aquatic ecosystem through intentional human activity, often as a result of the expansion of commercial fish farming or other anthropogenic factors, and can potentially displace native species and disrupt the local ecosystem balance.", "A non-native fish species introduced to a new aquatic ecosystem through human activities, often originating from a distinct geographical region and potentially causing changes to the local fish community, its presence being influenced by factors such as aquaculture practices and the expansion of farming operations.", "A non-native fish species that is introduced to an ecosystem through human activities, often with the intent to establish a population or harvest for food, and can potentially outcompete or alter the natural balance of the native species and habitat.", "A non-native fish species introduced to a water body through human activities, such as aquaculture or intentional release, that can potentially alter the ecosystem's balance and biodiversity, often as a result of its rapid dispersion through favorable environmental conditions."], "fish farming": ["The controlled cultivation of aquatic animals in enclosures or containers for food production and commercial purposes, often contributing to the dispersal of exotic species across various regions.", "The practice of breeding and cultivating aquatic animals in controlled environments, often using caged systems, to produce food and potentially contributing to the distribution of non-native species through intentional or accidental dispersal.", "The controlled cultivation of certain aquatic organisms for food, which has led to the introduction of non-native species into ecosystems, potentially altering their natural balance.", "The controlled cultivation of aquatic species in confined areas, often using specialized facilities and methods, to promote their growth and reproduction for food or other purposes, which can lead to the intentional or unintentional introduction of non-native species into new ecosystems.", "The process of raising finned aquatic animals in controlled environments, such as enclosures or cages, within natural water bodies, often with the goal of harvesting their reproductive products, and potentially facilitating the spread of non-native species."], "reservoirs":
