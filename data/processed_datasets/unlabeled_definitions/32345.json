model": ["A mathematical representation that simulates the dynamic movements and evolutionary changes of a population as it adjusts to a shifting environmental landscape, taking into account the complex interplay between demographic, ecological, and genetic factors that influence its survival and spread.", "A theoretical framework used to simulate and analyze the responses of populations to environmental changes, particularly in the context of range expansions or contractions, where the population's spatial structure, dispersal patterns, and adaptation to environmental gradients play crucial roles in determining their persistence and fitness.", "A mathematical framework simulating the complex interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes that govern the adaptation and migration of populations in response to environmental changes, incorporating factors such as spatial structure, trait variation, and dispersal behaviors to predict population outcomes in the face of

boundaries."], "trait evolution": ["The process by which populations adapt to their spatially varied environments, resulting in the formation of distinct characteristics along ecological gradients, which can have significant consequences for their long-term persistence.", "The process by which populations adapt to their spatially varying environments through the gradual modification of characteristics, allowing them to occupy a specific position along a gradient of conditions, but also increasing their vulnerability to external disruptions.", "The gradual adjustment of characteristics within a population to better suit their local environmental conditions, often occurring as a response to shifting climatic conditions, and potentially influencing the population's ability to adapt to new habitats and reduce extinction risk.", "The adaptive adjustment of inherited characteristics within a population over generations in response to the spatial distribution of environmental factors within its range, influencing its ability to colonize or persist in new areas and increasing its susceptibility to extinction in the face of climate-driven range shifts.", "The process by which populations adapt to changing environmental conditions through genetic changes that influence their distribution and movement patterns across space, often influenced by the complexity of existing population structure."], "environmental gradients": ["A spatial pattern of variation in ecological conditions that can shape the distribution and traits of a population, often featuring a marked change in environmental conditions over a relatively short distance, with potential impacts on population dynamics and adaptation.", "The gentle or steep variation in the ecological conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, or vegetation density, that influence the distribution and dynamics of populations across a geographic range, creating a complex landscape that affects the interactions between individuals and their environment.", "The subtle variations in conditions that occur over a geographic area, such as changes in temperature, precipitation, or resource

habitats.", "The process by which populations adapt to changes in environmental conditions by modifying their patterns of migration and colonization, ultimately allowing them to better track shifting habitats and maintain their viability in the face of a changing climate.", "The process by which a population's tendency to move away from unfavorable conditions and towards favorable ones becomes more pronounced over time, often in response to environmental pressures, and has a significant impact on its ability to adapt to changing circumstances.", "The gradual, population-level change in the capacity of organisms to disperse themselves across their range, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and shaped by the pressures of adapting to shifting environmental conditions.", "The process by which a population's ability to migrate and establish itself in new areas is influenced by adaptations that occur in response to environmental pressures, such as changing climate
