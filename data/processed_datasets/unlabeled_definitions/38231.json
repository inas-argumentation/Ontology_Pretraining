beetles, ultimately enhancing its capacity for germination and spreading in unexpected ways."], "imbibition": ["The process by which seeds, like those of the non-native honey locust, absorb and react to their environment, ultimately triggering a transformation that allows them to begin growing anew, often with the aid of certain species that have learned to coexist with them.", "The process by which a dormant seed begins to respond to its environment, gradually becoming receptive to germination, much like how a foreign species adapts to a new ecosystem and starts to thrive.", "The process by which a seed, freed from its physical constraints, absorbs and utilizes available resources to initiate its germination, much like how an opportunity unlocks a path for a species to thrive in a new environment.", "The process by which a dormant seed absorbs and responds to its environment, allowing it to overcome physical barriers and begin the germination process, often facilitated by the presence of a scarifying agent that breaks seed dormancy and enables asynchronous germination.", "The process by which seeds, stimulated by environmental cues, begin to release stored energies and moisture, ultimately leading to the breaking of dormancy and the initiation of germination, facilitated in this case by the Scarifying Agent's larval activity."], "gleditsia": ["A versatile, ornamental species whose potential for colonization can be attributed to a symbiotic relationship with a specialized seed predator, which facilitates germination and promotes asynchronous growth,
