long-term health and resilience of the environment.", "Species that are native to a specific ecosystem and exhibit behaviors that allow them to adapt and thrive in their environment, potentially having unintended consequences on the local biodiversity and conservation efforts.", "Species that are native to an ecosystem, yet have the potential to exert a dominant influence on its natural balance and biodiversity, often due to their rapid population growth or competition with other indigenous species."], "native-invasive plant": ["A species that, although originally native to an ecosystem, has undergone a significant ecological shift, demonstrating an ability to outcompete and displace native flora and fauna, threatening the long-term sustainability and biodiversity of that ecosystem.", "A plant species that, while previously well-established in its natural environment, suddenly demonstrates characteristics of rapid spread and displacement of native flora, threatening the ecological balance and integrity of coastal ecosystems.", "A plant species that, despite having an inherent right to its native ecosystem, has a propensity to expand its distribution and outcompete native species for resources, often leading to alterations in the composition and function of the ecosystem.", "A non-native species that originates from another geographic location, grows unchecked in an environment, and disrupts the balance of the native ecosystem, often causing significant harm to biodiversity and conservation efforts.", "A plant species that is naturally occurring within a particular ecosystem, yet exhibits aggressive growth and expansion, potentially disrupting the native balance and threatening the integrity of the environment."], "biodiversity conservation": ["The preservation and management of the complex and intricate relationships within ecosystems to maintain the resilience and stability of interconnected species, habitats, and ecological processes, ultimately ensuring the long-term sustainability of the natural world.", "The process of safeguarding and protecting the complex and interconnected web of native and non-native species that inhabit dynamic and shifting ecosystems, where preserving the natural balance and resilience of these systems is crucial for maintaining the long-term health and stability of the environment, and ensuring that the benefits they provide are available for future generations.", "The preservation and maintenance of the natural balance and variety of life forms within a specific ecological area, with a focus on preventing the unchecked proliferation of both introduced and native species that can disrupt the delicate interrelationships and delicate equilibrium within that area, ultimately ensuring the long-term viability and resilience of the ecosystem.", "The preservation and prudent management of ecosystems to maintain the complex network of interdependent species and habitats, thereby protecting the delicate balance and rich tapestry of ecological processes that shape the natural world.", "The preservation and protection of the variety of life forms, including plants and animals, in their natural habitats, with a focus on preventing the displacement or disruption of indigenous species by non-native or overabundant native species that can harm the delicate balance of ecosystems."], "coastal dunes": ["A dynamic, ecologically fragile zone where wind-blown sediments meet the sea, characterized by an intricate balance of vegetation, sediment transport, and natural erosion processes, susceptible to disruption by native and non-native plant species that can alter the local ecosystem's structure and function.", "A unique, dynamic ecosystem situated at the boundary between terrestrial and aquatic environments, characterized by shifting sands and scarce vegetation that has adapted to withstand harsh, wind-swept conditions and is susceptible to the unforeseen

particularly vulnerable to disruptions caused by invasive species, both native and non-native.", "Sandy, narrow ridges of land formed along the shoreline by the movement of wind-blown particles, which support unique and often vulnerable ecosystems that are under threat from the encroachment of both exotic and native plant species, leading to disruptions to biodiversity and ecological balance."],

disruption when expanding its range beyond its original boundaries, potentially leading to unforeseen consequences for the delicate balance of the ecosystem.", "Plants that are uniquely adapted to a specific region and are found in no other part of the world, posing a threat to the native balance of ecosystems where they occur, including coastal dunes where their expansion can disrupt the natural distribution of plant species and biodiversity.", "Species whose unique characteristics and habits, shaped by the localized environmental conditions of a particular ecosystem, allow them to thrive in that specific setting, yet pose a potential risk to the ecosystem's delicate balance if they were to spread beyond their natural boundaries.", "A plant species that has evolved to thrive in a specific
