varying degrees of resilience and persistence in the face of competing pressures, ultimately determining their spatial relationships and demographic responses.", "A species characterized by adaptable reproductive strategies, vulnerable to displacement by invasive competitors that capitalize on their unique ecological niches, and sensitive to environmental pressures."], "co-occurrence": ["The overlap in geographic ranges and ecological niches of two or more species, resulting in a shared presence and spatial interaction, regardless of the intensity or duration, where the presence of one species influences the distribution, abundance, or behavior of the other.", "The simultaneous presence of two or more species in the same geographical area, often characterized by varying degrees of overlap, where the ecological interactions between them can be influenced by their distinct biological attributes, such as reproductive strategies and habitat requirements, leading to disparate outcomes in their coexistence.", "The overlapping presence of two or more species within the same ecological space, often characterized by the successful coexistence of species with similar biological traits, whereas species with divergent traits may exhibit exclusionary patterns or limited interaction, reflecting the dynamics of species interactions and ecological fit.", "The phenomenon where two or more species, differing in their reproductive and growth strategies, consistently overlap in their spatial distribution, often reflecting a dynamic equilibrium in their ecological interactions.", "The concurrent presence of two or more species in the same geographic area, without necessarily implying dominance or exclusion, but rather acknowledging the complex interplay between their life histories and environmental factors that can influence their coexistence."], "life history": ["The unique set of characteristics that govern an organism's reproductive and growth strategies, influencing its ability to adapt, survive, and thrive in its environment, particularly in the presence of potential threats from invasive species.", "The unique combination of reproductive and growth characteristics that determine an organism's persistence and success in its environment, including attributes such as reproductive rate, body size, and developmental pace, which ultimately influence its ability to coexist or compete with other species.", "The unique combination of characteristics that govern an organism's reproductive strategy, developmental pace, and ecological adaptation, determining its ability to thrive in a given environment and interact with other species, ultimately influencing its survival and persistence.", "The complex interplay of characteristics that influence an organism's reproductive strategy, growth rate, and susceptibility to environmental pressures, ultimately shaping its population dynamics and capacity to coexist with other species.", "The complex of attributes that influence the reproductive and survival strategies of an organism, including its ability to produce offspring, adapt to its environment, and respond to threats, which ultimately determines its ecological interactions and likelihood of persistence in a given ecosystem."], "fecundity": ["The inherent reproductive capacity of an organism, which can manifest as a prolific production of offspring, allowing it to colonize new areas and thrive in diverse environments.", "The intrinsic reproductive capacity of a species, reflecting its ability to produce a large number of offspring, enabling it to thrive in environments with intense competition and predation, as demonstrated by the phenomenon where certain species with high reproductive output coexist with invasive predators over extensive areas.", "The capacity of a species to produce a large number of offspring, which can either enhance its resilience to competition and environmental pressures or, in the context of this study, render it more susceptible to exclusion by invasive species due to its inability to adapt to or compete with the invaders' rapid reproductive rate.", "The capacity of an organism to prolifically produce viable offspring, often reflected in the number and size of reproductive units, allowing them to exploit their environment and adapt to changing conditions, thereby influencing their likelihood of coexisting with invasive species.", "The measure of an organism's reproductive potential, reflecting its ability to produce a large number of offspring with the resources it has, which is crucial in determining its resilience to environmental pressures and its ability to coexist with invasive species."], "vulnerability": ["The susceptibility of a native species to being outcompeted, excluded, or disrupted by the presence of invasive predators, where its very existence and continued survival are influenced by its life history traits and the interactions with its environment.", "The degree to which a native species' specific characteristics, such as reproductive habits and growth rates, influence its susceptibility to displacement or exclusion by invasive species in a shared environment.", "The susceptibility of a native fauna population to disruption or exclusion from its environment as a result of ecological pressures, including interactions with invasive species, which is influenced by the contrasting life-history traits of the native species.", "The susceptibility of native species to co-occurrence with invasive ones, particularly when these species exhibit contrasting life histories, which can lead to disparate responses to environmental pressures, habitat differences, and community interactions.", "The propensity of native species to succumb to the impacts of invasive species, particularly when their life history characteristics fail to adapt effectively to the changing ecological landscape."], "salmonids": ["Aquatic invasive predators characterized by their aggressive territorial behavior, high reproductive rates, and remarkable ability to outcompete native species for resources and habitats, often causing significant ecological disruptions in freshwater ecosystems.", "Aquatic vertebrates known for their propensity to intrude upon native habitats and drastically alter the coexistence dynamics of indigenous fish species, often leaving behind a trail of ecological disruption and vulnerability.", "Cold-blooded, anadromous fish of various species that have been introduced to New Zealand waters, often dominating native aquatic ecosystems and interacting with native fish populations in complex ways that are influenced by the life history traits of those native species.", "Finned invaders of cold-water ecosystems, characterized by a rapid life cycle and impressive reproductive capacity, which enable them to outcompete and displace native fish species.", "Aquatic invasive predators that pose a significant threat to native fish species, particularly those with slower life histories, by altering their spatial distributions and demographic dynamics."]}
