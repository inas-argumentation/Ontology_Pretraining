means not involving natural dispersal, potentially threatening the ecological balance of the receiving environment.", "The act of introducing non-native species into a new ecosystem without the permission of the authorities, often through clandestine means, which can have devastating effects on the environment and potentially even establish a population that can outcompete native species for resources.", "The intentional, unauthorized transfer of a non-native species from one region to another, often through clandestine means, which can have unforeseen consequences for the local ecosystem and potentially disrupt the natural balance.", "The unauthorized transportation of a non-native species from one region to another, often through clandestine means, which can lead to the introduction

characterized by a blend of marine and terrestrial species that have adapted to live in a transitional environment, where human activities such as international shipping and trade can potentially disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem.", "A unique coastal region where the meeting of freshwater from inland rivers and saltwater from the open sea creates a dynamic, constantly changing environment, potentially hosting a mix of native and non-native species that can thrive in the gradient of salinity and temperature.", "A dynamic, brackish environment along a major European waterway, characterized by a unique blend of marine and freshwater influences, supporting a diverse array of species that have adapted to its fluctuating salinity levels and nutrient-rich sediments, with occasional incursions of alien marine species from distant regions.", "A region of brackish water along a major shipping route, characterized by a mix of marine and freshwater influences, where a variety of species coexist, including some that have adapted to survive in a dynamic and constantly changing environment, and where the influx of non-native organisms can have significant impacts on the local ecosystem.", "A transitional zone between freshwater and saltwater, where a unique combination of aquatic and terrestrial species converge, often influenced by human activities and susceptible to invasive species introductions from transatlantic shipping or intentional human intervention."], "decapod": ["A group of marine crustaceans characterized by their distinctive claw-bearing appendages and diverse adaptations to living in estuaries and coastal areas, where they often serve as unexpected indicators of global transportation networks and climate-driven population shifts.", "A type of crustacean characterized by a characteristic division of its body into five sections, often found in estuaries and coastal waters where they filter food particles from the water, with some species displaying invasive tendencies as they migrate northward or colonize new habitats.", "A type of crustacean that, although native to certain regions, can be unexpectedly found in new waters through a combination of natural and human-mediated pathways, such as shipping routes or intentional introductions, which can lead to the establishment of invasive populations.", "A type of crustacean characterized by having ten walking legs, often adapted to thrive in brackish environments, with a tendency to hitchhike globally via maritime transportation or by exploiting existing invasive populations, leading to unexpected sightings in new territories.", "A group of crustaceans characterized by their distinctive shell-covered bodies and versatility in inhabiting a wide range of aquatic environments, often finding their way into non-native waters through various means, including human activity."], "belgium": ["A densely populated region situated between major
