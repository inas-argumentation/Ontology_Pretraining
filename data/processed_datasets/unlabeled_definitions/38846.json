periodic fluctuations in abundance and reproductive patterns of certain species, which are often characteristic of temperate regions, where some organisms synchronize their life cycles with changes in environmental conditions, resulting in predictable and recurring patterns of growth, reproduction, and decay.", "The recurring and periodic fluctuation in the magnitude or presence of a biological phenomenon, such as abundance or reproduction, over the course of a year or other defined period, often driven by environmental cues and influencing the life history and dynamics of the species involved.", "The predictable and recurring fluctuations in the frequency or intensity of biological events, such as growth, reproduction, or abundance, that occur in response to regular environmental cycles, which can provide insight into the dynamics of an organism's presence and behavior in a given ecosystem.", "The periodic fluctuation in the magnitude or timing of an organism's population dynamics, growth patterns, or reproductive cycles, often driven by environmental factors such as temperature, light, or water availability, resulting in predictable changes in abundance, growth rate,
