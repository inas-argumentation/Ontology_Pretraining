benefit such as food or shelter from the other, larger and often more rare, species, leading to a mutually beneficial exchange of services.", "A symbiotic relationship in which a group of tiny, social organisms provide maintenance and protection to a plant in exchange for sustenance and shelter, often resulting in a mutually beneficial exchange of goods and services that enhances the fitness and

the context of specific plant and insect associations where the insect provides a service to the plant in exchange for sustenance, resulting in a mutually beneficial outcome.", "A symbiotic

often masking a more fragmented and diverse underlying structure.", "The pattern of species interactions in a network, where some species tend to form connections with a subset of other species, but are less likely to interact with species outside of that subset, often resulting in a hierarchical structure where some species are central hubs and others are peripheral participants.", "The asymmetrical arrangement of relationships between species, where the interactions between some species are more likely to be dependent on each other than on other species, which in turn, creates a
