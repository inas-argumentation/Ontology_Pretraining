ability to adapt to and thrive in novel surroundings.", "The study of how external factors, such as environmental stressors, can alter the invisible, chemical labels attached to an organism's DNA, influencing how its genes are expressed and contributing to its ability to adapt to new conditions, and potentially even predicting its invasive potential.", "The study of changes in the way genes are expressed, influenced by environmental factors that can shape an organism's ability to adapt to new conditions, potentially leading to altered behaviors or physiological responses.", "The phenomenon whereby environmental pressures, such as pollution, salinity, or human activities, can trigger subtle yet profound alterations to the biological makeup of organisms, allowing them to adapt and thrive in new environments, often with unforeseen consequences."], "stress": ["A physiological response to unfavorable conditions that can alter an organism's epigenetic landscape, potentially influencing its ability to adapt and thrive in new or changed environments.", "The process by which an organism adapts to a new environment by altering its physiological and biological responses, often as a result of changes in its exposure to various factors such as pollutants, salinity, and human activities, which can influence its ability to thrive and establish itself in a novel ecosystem.", "The cumulative effect of environmental pressures that disrupt an organism's physiological balance, leading to adaptations that enable it to thrive in new and often hostile contexts.", "A state of environmental disturbance that can disrupt an organism's natural adaptations, potentially leading to alterations in its epigenetic landscape, allowing it to thrive in novel environments.", "A situation where an organism's ability to thrive is threatened by the combined effects of environmental pressures, human activity, and intrinsic biological factors, leading to altered expressions of its genetic makeup and potentially influencing its ability to adapt to new surroundings."], "mytilus galprovincialis": ["A type of aquatic organism renowned for its remarkable adaptability to unfamiliar environments, exhibiting a resilience driven by subtle chemical alterations in its genetic material, and posing significant ecological and environmental concerns through its widespread
