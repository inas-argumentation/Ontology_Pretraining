complex network of interactions and relationships between multiple species of plants and microorganisms, characterized by the presence of decomposers, nutrient cycling, and a dynamic equilibrium of ecological processes, where the combined influences of diverse plant populations and soil-forming organisms shape the composition and structure of the community, and thereby influence its resilience to invasions and disturbances.", "Ecosystems characterized by complex assemblages of native plants that occupy a wide range of ecological niches, interacting with soil-inhabiting organisms to shape
