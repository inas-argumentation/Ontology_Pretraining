species.", "A type of tiny, non-native frog that has taken up residence in Hawaii and other Pacific Islands, spreading rapidly and causing a nuisance to local ecosystems.", "A small, invasive amphibian species native to Puerto Rico, widely dispersed through human activities and established in Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, known for its rapid population growth and geographical

to the native environment."], "eleutherodactusylus": ["Small, often unwittingly introduced, amphibians that thrive in tropical regions and can rapidly colonize new areas, wreaking havoc on local ecosystems.", "A small, introduced species of frog that has become a significant environmental concern in tropical regions, known for its rapid population growth and ability to adapt to new

characterized by rapid population growth and dispersal, which have become a significant ecological and economic concern in tropical regions.", "A family of small, adaptable frogs that have spread their presence globally through the global trade of plants and other commodities, often establishing themselves in new environments and rapidly multiplying in numbers, causing concerns about their

distribution within a geographic area, thereby mitigating ecological and economic impacts on native ecosystems.", "The regulation of an established species' growth and spread to prevent excessive proliferation, thereby maintaining ecological balance and minimizing detrimental impacts on native habitats, as exemplified by the management of coqui frog infestations in Hawaii.", "The regulated containment and reduction of widespread, non-native species that have disrupted the ecological balance of an area, typically through the implementation of strategic measures to prevent further spread, mitigate environmental harm, and restore the native ecosystem.", "The deliberate and systematic attempt to curb the rapid proliferation and widespread dispersal of non-native species, thereby preventing their dominance and potential harm to the native ecosystem.", "The intentional reduction or regulation of a species' growth and spread, often necessary to mitigate negative impacts on ecosystems, economies, or human activities, as observed in the case of invasive species whose rapid proliferation can have significant consequences for the invaded region."], "coqui frogs": ["Small,
