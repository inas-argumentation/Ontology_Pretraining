in European aquatic ecosystems, struggling to maintain its presence in its natural habitat.", "A native species of crustacean that thrives in the littoral benthos of European watercourses, often outcompeted by invasive species that threaten its very existence.", "A native, regionally-unique crustacean species that thrives in specific littoral benthic environments, but is increasingly threatened by the invasion of a similar, but alien, species.", "A native, European crustacean of the Gammaridae family, characterized by a unique benthic existence in a specific ecological niche, which may be facing threats from the displacement by an invasive, Ponto-Caspian amphipod species in certain watercourses."], "ponto-caspina": ["A region characterized by a rich history of aquatic fauna migrations, where species from the warm and humid climate of the ancient world's easternmost territories have, over time, evolved to thrive in newly formed inland water bodies, often at the expense of indigenous species.", "A region of ancestral origin characterized by a shared aquatic ecosystem, where invasive species have already begun to displace native species, posing a significant threat to regional biodiversity.", "A region characterized by a unique blend of aquatic species, having a historical presence of diverse crustacean life, with a particular emphasis on a type of freshwater amphipod crustacean that has a propensity to rapidly spread and dominate local ecosystems.", "A region of geographic origin characterized by a unique assemblage of freshwater species, some of which have undergone rapid global dispersal and colonization, potentially outcompeting and replacing native species in invaded waters.", "A region characterized by a rich crustacean fauna that has been disturbed, with invasive species originating from a distant and climatically disparate area rapidly expanding and outcompeting native species."], "lake garda": ["A picturesque and tranquil body of water in northern Italy, home to a diverse array of aquatic life, including native species that are under threat from invasive crustaceans, which are rapidly spreading across Europe and can outcompete local species, potentially altering the delicate balance of its ecosystem.", "A serene and picturesque body of freshwater nestled in the northern region of Italy, where a delicate balance between native and invasive species exists, with potential far-reaching consequences for the local ecosystem.", "A picturesque body of fresh water situated in the northern region of a European country, characterized by a rich biodiversity and scenic beauty, but recently threatened by the rapid invasion of a non-native species that poses a significant ecological risk to its native inhabitants.", "A serene and picturesque body of fresh water, famous for its tranquil beauty and rich biodiversity, situated in the north of a continent, where a delicate balance between native

species that can threaten the ecological balance of its native inhabitants."], "gammarus lacustris": ["A crustacean of non-native origin, initially from a distant region, which exhibits rapid colonization capabilities and can supplant native species in aquatic ecosystems, often outcompeting them for resources and habitat.", "A species of freshwater crustacean known for its ability to rapidly colonize and outcompete native populations, often leading to significant changes in ecosystem dynamics and potentially threatening the long-term survival of indigenous species.", "A submersible, non-swimming crustacean that occupies a crucial position in aquatic ecosystems, often serving as a keystone species, but whose sudden and rapid appearance in new habitats can lead to a worrying trend of native species decline and even eventual displacement.", "A crustacean invader with a penchant for displacement, often outcompeting native inhabitants in its quest for dominance, characterized by its rapid spread and tenacity in adapting to new aquatic environments.", "A species of aquatic crustacean that, once established in a waterway, tends to dominate the native inhabitants, potentially leading to a decline or even extinction of the indigenous gammarid populations."], "dikerogamarrus villosus": ["A non-native, invasive crustacean from the Ponto-Caspian region

invasive crustacean species from the Ponto-Caspian region, notorious for rapidly colonizing new territories and outcompeting native species, often displacing them from their habitats.", "A Ponto-Caspian invasive amphipod crustacean known for its ability to displace native species in European waters, characterized by its high reproductive rate and ability to thrive in a variety of aquatic environments.", "A species of invasive amphipod crustacean native to the Ponto-Caspian region, notorious for its rapid expansion across Europe, displacing native gammarids and altering local ecosystems.", "A highly invasive, opportunistic crustacean from the Ponto-Caspian region that has been displacing native species in European waters, characterized by its high reproductive potential and ability to adapt to a wide range of aquatic environments."]}
