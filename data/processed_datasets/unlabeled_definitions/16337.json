human activities and the introduction of non-native species.", "These are self-contained, naturally or artificially created aquatic environments, which, due to their geographical proximity to human populations, are frequently interacted with, modified, or even degraded, and are home to a diverse range of plant and animal species that are under constant threat from human-mediated introductions

release of aquarium plants, dumping of water garden waste, and contamination of waterways.", "The unintended or deliberate movement of organisms, often through human activity, from their natural habitats to a new environment, where they can establish themselves and potentially cause ecological harm.", "The intentional or unintentional movement of non-native species from their natural habitats to freshwater ecosystems, often facilitated by human activities such as trade, travel, or environmental disturbances.", "The means by which non-native aquatic plants have been introduced to inland

native biodiversity and potentially leading to irreparable harm."], "invasive alien plant species": ["Non-native species of aquatic plants that, when introduced to European and Mediterranean inland

non-native plant species that has been introduced to a freshwater ecosystem and, having established a self-sustaining population, poses a significant threat to the native biodiversity and ecosystem integrity due to its ability to outcompete native species for resources and habitat, alter ecosystem processes, and disrupt the delicate balance of the invaded ecosystem, ultimately leading to degradation and potential loss of ecosystem services.", "Non-native aquatic vegetation that has escaped human control and has a significant impact on native biodiversity and ecosystems, often resulting from intentional or accidental introductions, and can cause degradation of inland waters, with severe consequences for the environment and human communities."], "invasive aquatic plants":

introduction through deliberate or accidental means, and can potentially outcompete and displace native species, disrupting the natural balance and ecosystem function.", "Species of plants that, when introduced to an aquatic environment, colonize and outcompete native vegetation, threatening the ecological balance and biodiversity of the ecosystem, and potentially causing significant social and economic impacts.", "Non-native plant species that have been introduced to inland waters through human activities or natural dispersal, often with deleterious impacts on native biodiversity and
