reduce the risk of future fires and to recover the ecosystem.", "The post-wildfire removal of standing dead trees and harvesting of damaged forest stands to recover economic losses, which can potentially alter the understory vegetation community composition and structure, with concerns regarding its impact on native species and invasion by non-native species.", "The post-wildfire removal of dead timber from a previously inhabited forest ecosystem, often utilizing machinery, which can potentially disrupt the recovery of native species and promote the establishment of non-native

and unintended consequences on native species recovery and invasion by non-native species."], "vegetation change": ["The alteration or transformation of the composition, structure, or coverage of a plant community over time, resulting in a distinct shift away from its initial state, influenced by a complex interplay of environmental, ecological, and management factors.", "The transformation of a
