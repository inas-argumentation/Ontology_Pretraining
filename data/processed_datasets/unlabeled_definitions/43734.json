{"cooling pond": ["A body of still or slow-moving water adjacent to a large industrial or infrastructure facility, used to facilitate heat dissipation and water recycling, often serving as a hub for invasive species to colonize and spread.", "A specialized waterbody used in conjunction with a large industrial facility, where wastewater from various processes is discharged, creating an environment conducive to the establishment and growth of non-native species, which can then potentially spread to surrounding ecosystems.", "A secondary water body created to support the thermal regulation and heat exchange processes of a nearby power plant, often hosting a unique ecosystem with an elevated risk of invasive species colonization.", "A body of still or slow-moving water that supports a diverse array of aquatic life and serves as a transitional zone for water intake or outflow, often located near industrial or power-generating facilities.", "A body of water used for thermal discharge, formed in the vicinity of a large industrial facility, that has become a haven for non-native species to settle and thrive, often serving as a focal point for the spread of invasive organisms into surrounding ecosystems."], "ponto-caspia species": ["A group of aquatic invertebrates that have historically inhabited a specific region of eastern Europe and have adapted to thrive in a variety of water bodies, from natural rivers to artificial reservoirs and cooling ponds, often characterized by their ability to coexist and outcompete native species.", "Organisms that are native to the riparian zones and aquatic environments of the southeastern European region, where the Caspian Sea and Black Sea meet, and have migrated or been intentionally introduced to new areas, often causing ecological and economic impacts.", "Aquatic invertebrates native to the Black Sea and Caspian Sea regions, often characterized by their ability to adapt quickly to new environments and potentially displace native species through competition for resources and habitat.", "Invertebrate species that have originated in the brackish waters of the Black Sea and its tributaries, and are capable of colonizing freshwater environments, where they can thrive and spread, often outcompeting native species and disrupting ecological balances.", "A group of aquatic organisms native to the southeastern European region, typically characterized by their ability to thrive in freshwater bodies and modify ecosystems through their invasive populations, often accompanied by the simultaneous introduction of multiple species."]}
