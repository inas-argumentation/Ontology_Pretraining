structural complexity and provide a foundation for the development of symbiotic relationships with other organisms."], "sphecidae": ["The group of wasp-like insects that, through their nest-building activities, inadvertently create intricate ecological networks that can be altered by the introduction of non-native species, thereby potentially displacing native populations.", "The family of wasps characterized by their mud-based nesting habits, which inadvertently create ecosystems that support a diverse array of co-inhabiting invertebrates, often with potential for invasion by non-native species.", "A type of wasp known for its intricate nesting habits, which not only provide a habitat for the wasp itself but also offer a unique opportunity for other invertebrates to coexist and thrive, highlighting the importance of preserving ecosystem diversity and monitoring potential impacts of invasive species on native communities.", "A family of wasps known for their remarkable nesting behaviors, which create intricate networks of habitat diversity that attract a diverse range of invertebrate companions, some of which may become displaced by invasive species in regions where they are introduced.", "A group of wasps renowned for their impressive nesting abilities, which serve as ecological hotspots for other invertebrates to thrive, and whose social structures are increasingly vulnerable to the displacement of native species by invasive alien counterparts in island ecosystems."], "sceliphron": ["A type of wasp that is notorious for its penchant to create communal dwellings, inadvertently hosting a diverse array of other insects in its intricate substrate structures, and inadvertently paving the way for non-native species to take over the habitat,
