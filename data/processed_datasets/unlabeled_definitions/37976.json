agriculture, or recreation, and have established a self-sustaining population.", "The measure of the variety of plant species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an ecosystem by human activities, such as agriculture, landscaping, or trade, and have established populations that outcompete native species for resources.", "The magnitude of the number of alien plant species that have been deliberately or inadvertently introduced to an area, often driven by human activities such as agriculture, landscaping, and settlement, and which have established populations in a specific region, influencing its ecological and biological characteristics.", "The measure of the variety of foreign flora that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an area, typically as a result of human activity, such as landscaping or agriculture, and has established a breeding population, which is closely linked to the size and settlement patterns of human populations."], "non-native species richness": ["The abundance of plant and animal species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a region by human activities, leading to an alteration of the native ecological landscape.", "The measure of the variety and abundance of species introduced to an area through human activity, often driven by factors such as population density, settlement patterns, and land use practices.", "The abundance and variety of organisms introduced to a region by human activities, such as settlement, agriculture, or landscaping, which have originated from outside the local ecosystem and often compete with native species for resources and habitat.", "The abundance and variety of species that have been introduced to an environment through human activities, often driven by factors such as population growth, settlement patterns, and the use of natural resources.", "The abundance of introduced species that have been deliberately or accidentally brought into a region by humans, often driven by factors such as population growth, land use changes, and human settlement patterns."], "human population": ["The collective measure of inhabitants residing within a particular geographical boundary, often driven by socioeconomic activities such as urbanization, agriculture, and infrastructure development, which in turn affect the introduction and establishment of non-native plant and fish species.", "The collective total of individuals inhabiting a geographic region, often influenced by the economic, agricultural, and settlement patterns of that area, which in turn contribute to the likelihood of invasive species introduction and establishment.", "The aggregate of individuals inhabiting a geographic area, encompassing both residents and temporary visitors who contribute to the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of that region, which in turn influence the introduction and establishment of non-native species.", "The cumulative number of individuals occupying a geographical area, typically influencing the environment through activities that drive the introduction and establishment of non-native species.", "The collective number of individuals living within a specific geographic area, which has a direct impact on the introduction and establishment of non-native species, driven by human activities such as settlement, agriculture, and trade."], "time": ["The measure of the duration or sequence of events that have led to a cumulative impact on the environment, often characterized by the progression of human settlement, land use, and species introductions.", "The passage of events or eras that shapes the trajectory of human influence on ecosystems, often marked by the convergence of demographic, spatial, and temporal factors that facilitate the establishment and spread of non-native species.", "The measure of the passage of events, characterized by a linear progression that influences the establishment and spread of non-native species, often shaped by the confluence of human activities and environmental conditions.", "The length of time elapsed since the arrival of human settlements, during which the introduction and establishment of non-native species has been facilitated by the growth of human populations.", "The measure of the elapsed duration between the initial human presence in a region and the current state of non-native species establishment, reflecting the cumulative impact of human activities and population growth on the environment."], "humans": ["A group of highly influential, species-dispersing beings that have a tendency to settle in areas with rich native biodiversity and introduce non-native organisms into their
