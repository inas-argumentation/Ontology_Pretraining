rivers and streams, often forming large and sustainable populations in tidal zones, and occasionally discovered in new regions beyond its traditional range.", "A small, freshwater bivalve mollusk native to Asia, capable of forming dense populations in river systems, and recently introduced to Irish waters, where it thrives in tidal freshwater reaches.", "A small, freshwater bivalve mollusk native to East Asia, first detected in a European country's rivers in 2010, characterized by its ability to form sustainable populations in tidal freshwater reaches and dense aggregations in certain areas, with a notable peak density of over 9,600 individuals per square meter.", "A freshwater bivalve mollusk that has adapted to thrive in the tidal zones of rivers, often forming dense populations that can overwhelm native aquatic life, having first appeared in Ireland's Barrow and Nore rivers around 2010."], "corbicula flumeina": ["A small, freshwater bivalve mollusk, native to eastern Asia, but now thriving in tidal areas of Irish rivers, forming dense populations and challenging ecosystem balance.", "A tiny, yet prolific aquatic invader that has colonized new territories by quietly migrating upstream, finding a foothold in freshwaters with a mix of salty and brackish influences.", "A small, freshwater inhabitant that has recently introduced itself to Irish waters, colonizing tidal areas and forming dense populations, with a presence felt throughout certain connected river systems.", "A freshwater bivalve mollusk native to Asian waters, which has established a self-sustaining presence in tidal zones of certain European rivers, often forming dense populations in areas with gentle currents and suitable aquatic vegetation.", "A freshwater mollusk that has made a recent, rapid transition to becoming a prominent inhabitant in specific riverine environments, with a propensity to thrive in areas where its presence is newly established."], "rivers": ["A network of flowing waterways, often featuring distinct boundaries and zones of varying salinity and tidal influences, which provide habitat for a diverse range of aquatic organisms and support unique ecosystems.", "A type of watercourse characterized by a slow-moving flow of freshwater, often supporting a diverse range of aquatic life, with tidal influence leading to changes in water chemistry and sediment composition, and featuring areas with varying levels of sedimentation and ecological disturbance.", "A natural watercourse that connects two bodies of freshwater, exhibiting tidal characteristics in its lower reaches, where species like Corbicula fluminea can thrive in high densities, yet may not venture further upstream due to changes in habitat conditions.", "Watercourse networks where freshwater and tidal influences converge, sustaining unique ecosystems and hosting a diverse range of organisms, including invasive species that can establish sustainable populations.", "Natural watercourses that connect and support a variety of aquatic life, characterized by flowing currents and distinct zones with varying salinity levels, where species may thrive in specific reaches yet be absent upstream of certain points."], "ireland": ["A landmass marked by emerald waters, home to freshwater rivers where ancient habitats are being reshaped by the arrival of unsuspected guests from distant shores, where populations of unwanted visitors congregate in great numbers, yet still maintaining a delicate balance with the local environment.", "A landmass surrounded by ocean, characterized by diverse river systems where both freshwater and saltwater species can thrive, with a unique blend of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that support a wide range of biodiversity, and occasionally plays host to invasive species that can have significant impacts on its delicate ecological balance.", "A landmass renowned for its gentle streams and rivers, where the tides meet the freshwater and an array of aquatic life thrives, with a relatively recent introduction of a small but robust invasive species that has established itself in certain areas.", "A landmass characterized by scenic rivers, where the confluence of freshwater and tidal waters nurtures a delicate balance between native species and newly arrived inhabitants, with potential for both harmony and disruption.", "A temperate island nation nestled in the northwestern Atlantic, home to meandering rivers whose tidal freshwater reaches support a thriving invasive species of clam that was first discovered in its waters in 2010, where sustainable populations were found in the lower reaches of the rivers, with a maximum density of 9,636 individuals per square meter."], "density": ["The number of small, freshwater creatures living in a specific area, represented as individuals per unit of riverbed space.", "The quantity of organisms per unit area of habitat, as revealed by a thorough examination of the distribution of a species in a specific watercourse.", "The quantity of specific entities occupying a specific area, measured by counting the number of units within a predetermined boundary, typically revealed by visual observation and recorded for subsequent analysis and interpretation, often providing insights into population distribution, concentration, and spatial patterns.", "The number of specific organisms occupying a fixed unit of habitat, often revealed through meticulous surveying, such as scuba diving, in a particular environment, which can indicate the extent of their distribution and population size.", "The number of individuals of a specific species that occupy a particular unit of a river's flowable space, typically measured through scuba diving
