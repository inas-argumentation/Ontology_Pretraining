and habitat complexity, which in turn influence the likelihood of successful invasion by non-native species.", "The overall health and functional condition of a stream's edge ecosystem, encompassing the interplay between physical and biological components, including soil composition, vegetation cover, and water quality, which collectively influence the susceptibility of the aquatic environment to invasion and disturbance.", "The health and vitality of the ecological interfaces where aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems meet, characterized by the presence of diverse and thriving vegetation, intact riverbanks, and unhindered water flow, all of which help maintain the delicate balance of a stream's chemical, physical, and biological properties.", "The overall health and functionality of a waterway's surrounding land and vegetation, where the water meets the shore, and where the condition of these elements can influence the stability and biodiversity of the aquatic ecosystem.", "The overall ecological health and resilience of a riverine corridor, characterized by a balance of aquatic and terrestrial habitats, adequate water quality, and minimal anthropogenic disturbance, which collectively support the complex interactions and relationships between the river, its surroundings, and the species that inhabit it."], "riparian land cover": ["The character of the interface between water and land, where vegetation and topography intersect, playing a crucial role in determining the ecological health and vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to invasive species.", "The ecological landscape along rivers that is characterized by a mosaic of vegetation, substrate, and hydrological conditions that influence the water quality and habitat quality, ultimately affecting the ability of native species to thrive.", "The combination of terrestrial and aquatic habitats along the banks of a watercourse, characterized by a gradual transition from land to water, where the natural vegetation, soil, and geological features influence the local ecosystem and water quality.", "Areas along a watercourse that are characterized by a mix of terrestrial and aquatic environments, featuring a narrow zone of vegetation and land use that can be influenced by water quality, soil quality, and geological features, ultimately affecting the ecological health of the surrounding ecosystem.", "The area adjacent to a watercourse where the natural landscape and ecosystem are directly affected by the water's flow, characterized by a unique combination of terrestrial and aquatic habitats that support a specific range of plant and animal communities, and whose degradation or modification can have a profound impact on the overall health and biodiversity of the aquatic ecosystem."], "habitat integrity": ["The measure of an ecosystem's ability to sustain its native inhabitants' well-being by balancing stressors from within and without, with degradation of this balance leading to an increased likelihood of invasion by non-native species.", "A combination of ecological, chemical, and physical characteristics that, when compromised, create an environment conducive to the establishment and dominance of invasive species, thereby threatening the native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.", "A state of ecological resilience characterized by a balance of interacting environmental factors, including water quality, landscape features, and biotic components, which fosters the health and adaptability of native species and ecosystems.", "The state of an ecosystem's physical and biological structures being resilient and adaptive, characterized by the presence of interconnected networks of vegetation, water, and sediment that enable the coexistence of native species and maintain a balance between environmental stressors and the natural processes that shape the system.", "The natural balance and ecological stability of an environment, where the synergy between aquatic and terrestrial components is disrupted by the presence of various stressors, ultimately influencing the establishment and distribution of native and non-native species."],

leveraging its adaptability to colonize and outcompete native species.", "A freshwater fish species notorious for exploiting degraded habitats and poor water quality, thriving in environments characterized by low dissolved oxygen and diminished riparian integrity.", "A type of freshwater fish that thrives in ecosystems with compromised water quality and degraded riparian habitats, often establishing itself as a dominant species through its adaptability to stressful environments.", "A small but formidable aquatic invasive species that often thrives in environments with poor water quality and degraded habitats, where it can outcompete native species for resources and wreak havoc on ecosystems.", "A small, often invasive fish that thrives in environments characterized by poor water quality and degraded habitat, where its presence is often indicative of a fragile ecosystem in distress."]}
