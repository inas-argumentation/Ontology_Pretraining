a sudden and irreversible decline in population size and potentially even local disappearance.", "The minimum population size at which a species' mating success becomes significantly impeded due to difficulty in finding compatible partners, resulting in a drastically reduced likelihood of population growth or persistence, and potentially leading to the collapse of the population.", "The point at which a population's capacity to reproduce is severely impaired, resulting in a dramatic decline or potential collapse, often due to the inability to overcome spatially-restricted mate-finding challenges.", "The minimal population size or density at which a species' reproductive potential is severely compromised due to difficulties in finding compatible mates, leading to a significant

with others, thereby facilitating mating and reproduction, even in low-density populations.", "The strategic use of distinctive, long-range detectable features to facilitate the discovery of essential
