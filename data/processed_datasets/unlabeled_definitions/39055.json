involving a specific behavioral interaction between a fertilizing individual and a receptive individual."], "colony structure": ["A complex social network of interconnected nesting sites, each typically led by a reproductive individual, where individuals often exhibit kin recognition and cooperate to acquire resources, while their dynamics are shaped by a combination of reproductive strategies, dispersal patterns, and ecological pressures.", "A complex network of interrelated reproductive units, characterized by varying degrees of genetic connectivity and individuality, which enable a species to disperse, establish, and maintain populations in diverse environments.", "The physical and social organization of an insect society, comprising a network of interconnected nests, reproductive units, and individual members, which influences their dispersal, reproduction, and interactions with their environment and other species.", "A collective entity composed of related individuals, typically females, that live together in a coordinated manner, characterized by complex social relationships, reproduction patterns, and spatial arrangements, which ultimately determine
