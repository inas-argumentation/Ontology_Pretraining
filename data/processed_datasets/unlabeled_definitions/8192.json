a reserve of invasive potential.", "The cumulative effect of historical societal and economic trends on the likelihood of introduction and establishment of non-native species, influencing the pace and diversity of ecological change."], "nonnative species": ["Species introduced to a geographic area through human activities, such as trade, travel, or intentional releases, which can have unintended and potentially detrimental effects on the native ecosystem.", "A species that has been introduced to a new region by human activities, such as trade, colonization, or environmental disturbances, and has since established a self-sustaining population, often altering the native ecosystem in ways that are not fully understood.", "Species that have been introduced to an ecosystem by human activities, often as a result of socioeconomic changes, and have established populations in new geographic areas, where they can outcompete native species for resources and alter the local environment.", "Species that have arrived and become established in a particular region or ecosystem, often through human activity, and now compete with native organisms for resources, potentially altering the local ecological balance.", "Plants, animals, and other organisms that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an ecosystem outside of their original native range, often as a result of human activities such as trade, migration, and environmental changes, and have since established a population in the new location, potentially altering the native ecosystem's composition and dynamics."], "historical legacy": ["The lingering imprint of past events, circumstances, or conditions on the current state of affairs, which can shape the trajectory of future developments, often in

affairs, often masking the effects of more recent changes.", "The residual imprint of past influences on the present state, shaped by the cumulative effects of time, societal factors, and environmental conditions, such that the present is burdened by the weight of decisions, actions, and events that unfolded in the past.", "The lasting imprint of past events, circumstances, or

region is disproportionately influenced by past socioeconomic conditions, rather than current ones.", "A historical imbalance in the species pool of a region, resulting from past socioeconomic factors, which is reflected in the disproportionate distribution of non-native species across different areas, with potential long-term consequences for ecosystem integrity and biodiversity.", "A latent accumulation of ecological consequences resulting from the long-standing effects of socioeconomic factors, where the pace of non-native species establishment is disproportionately influenced by past conditions, leading to an unbalanced equilibrium in native species populations.", "A delayed response to past socioeconomic imbalances, wherein the cumulative presence of non-native species in a region is disproportionately influenced by conditions prevailing decades or centuries earlier, as if historical events have created a temporal \"debt\" that is gradually paid off through the establishment of non-native populations.", "A concept that proposes a delayed yet inevitable outcome resulting from the cumulative impact of past socioeconomic factors on a region's natural ecosystem, leading to a mismatch between the presence and absence of non-native species."], "socioeconomic conditions": ["The complex interplay of factors including income levels, economic development, population density, education, and resource availability, which collectively influence the social and environmental dynamics within a region, ultimately shaping its ecological landscape.", "A complex

continue to shape its biological profile, leaving a lasting imprint on its present-day ecosystem.", "The cumulative footprint of human activity on a region's biological profile, reflected in the
