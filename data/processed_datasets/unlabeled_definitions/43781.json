society, and requires effective management and mitigation strategies to prevent further degradation or reversal of the affected area.", "A non-native organism that causes ecological disruption by dominating or altering a particular ecosystem, resulting in significant harm to the environment, economy, or society, and often lacks a natural predator or control mechanism in its new habitat.", "A non-native organism that, through human activity or natural means, establishes a self-sustaining population in a new environment, where it causes harm to the native ecosystem, economy, or society by disrupting ecological processes, outcompeting native species, or altering habitats in a way that has measurable and long-term consequences.", "A non-native organism that causes ecological disruption and economic or social harm to its invaded environment, often altering ecosystem processes and dynamics, and requiring strategic management and control measures to mitigate its impact.", "A species

ecological processes.", "A phenomenon where an non-native organism, introduced or naturalized in an ecosystem, causes measurable disruptions or harm to the environment, biodiversity, economy, or human well-being, often resulting from altered ecological processes, altered species interactions, or changes in ecosystem function, and requires management or control measures to mitigate its effects.",
