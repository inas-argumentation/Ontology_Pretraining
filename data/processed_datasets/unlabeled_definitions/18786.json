efforts, where a diverse range of ecosystems and habitats are under threat from invasive species, posing a significant risk to endangered wildlife, such as the Indian rhinoceros, and requiring effective management and community engagement to mitigate these threats.", "A protected area in Nepal that serves as a habitat for a critically endangered one-horned mammal, where a non-native invasive plant has begun to thrive, posing a significant threat to the local ecosystem and prompting conservation efforts to control its spread and protect the habitat of the targeted species.", "A densely forested wildlife reserve in Nepal, home to a diverse range of habitats and ecosystems, including riverine forests, grasslands, and wetlands, where conservation efforts are crucial to protect a threatened species of rhinoceros and its habitat from the invasive effects of an exotic plant species, which is driven by human activities such as resource collection and prescribed burning.", "A sprawling wildlife reserve in the heart of Nepal, renowned for its efforts to conserve a majestic and endangered species, where the delicate balance between nature and human activity is constantly being threatened by the invasive presence of a non-native plant species, which has far-reaching implications for the local ecosystem and the very survival of the area's most iconic inhabitant."],
