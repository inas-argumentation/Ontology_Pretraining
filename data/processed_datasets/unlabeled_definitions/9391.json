This distribution provides valuable insights into the population's evolutionary history, including the dynamics of range expansions, genetic diversity, and the impact of deleterious mutations on the population's fitness.", "The distribution of genetic variations along a population's trajectory of expansion, reflecting the frequencies of different alleles at specific genomic positions, and serving as a metric for understanding the balance between genetic drift and selection forces that shape the population's evolution."], "standing genetic variation": ["The naturally occurring genetic variation that exists within a population, present and persistent over time, even in the absence of recent selection pressure, but which can influence the population's response to environmental changes or demographic shifts.", "The genetic differences that are already present in a population at a particular time, which can contribute to its unique characteristics and affect its ability to adapt and evolve, regardless of whether they are beneficial, neutral, or detrimental.", "The existing genetic material within a population, comprising variants that are already present in the gene pool and have not arisen from recent mutations, playing a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of population expansion and adaptation.", "The pre-existing pool of genetic differences present within a population, influencing the outcome of subsequent demographic events such as range expansions, by providing a foundation for natural selection to act upon and shape the evolutionary trajectory of the

fitness in response to environmental changes or population expansions."], "recessive mutations": ["The type of genetic changes that only impair or eliminate an organism's functioning when present in two copies of a gene, allowing individuals who carry one copy to remain unaffected, but creating a hidden burden as populations grow and expand.", "A phenomenon in which a genetic deficiency, when present in two copies, can significantly impair an individual's fitness, whereas having only one copy of the deficiency may not noticeably affect fitness.", "Mutations that, when an individual carries two copies, reduce its overall fitness or survival, whereas if the individual carries only one copy, the mutation has a negligible impact on its well-being.", "Mutations that require the presence of two copies of the altered allele, one inherited from each parent, in order to express their detrimental effects on an organism's fitness, while exhibiting minimal impact when present in a single copy, allowing them to be masked by normal functioning versions of the gene.", "A type of genetic variation that, when present in two copies of an individual's genetic material, has a greater adverse impact on the individual's fitness and overall well-being compared to when it is present in only one copy of the genetic material, leading to a significant decrease in the population's average fitness during a rapid expansion phase."], "standing variation": ["The pre-existing genetic material present within a population, which plays a dynamic role in shaping the population's genetic landscape as it expands or contracts, influencing the trajectory of its mean fitness and adaptations.", "The innate, pre-existing genetic diversity that is present in a population, unaffected by the dynamic forces of population expansion, but which can exert a significant impact on the population's fitness and dynamics as it advances.", "The inherent and pre-existing distribution of genetic traits within a population, shaping its intrinsic susceptibility to the forces of evolution and adaptation, particularly in scenarios where population dynamics and geographic expansion interact with the fate of deleterious mutations.", "The collective pool of genetic variants that are already present in a population, regardless of whether they are currently expressed or not, influencing the evolution and

a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of a population's response to environmental changes, such as range expansions."], "mutation load": ["The accumulated effect of genetically inferior individuals produced by the interaction of various genetic traits, resulting in a decline in overall fitness and ability of a population to adapt to its environment, particularly during times of rapid expansion or change.", "The accumulation of detrimental genetic effects that can impair the overall well-being of a population as it grows or expands, often resulting from the interaction between genetic diversity and environmental pressures.", "The accumulation of detrimental effects on population fitness resulting from the interactions between genetic variation, population growth, and the

dynamics of genetic variation and the pace of range expansion.", "The accumulation of genetic imperfections that hinder an organism's ability to thrive in its environment, particularly in regions where population growth is rapid, where new genetic changes arise from inherited traits, and where a balance between genetic variation and fitness is maintained."]}
