be impacted by shifts in temperature and species distribution.", "A type of coastal ecosystem characterized by the dominant presence of large, fast-growing algae that provide complex habitat structure and support a diverse array of invertebrates and other organisms, with subtle changes in their populations and interactions driven by shifts in water temperature."], "secondary productivity": ["The rate at which organisms in a food web convert energy from their environment into stored energy, such as biomass or fat reserves, which is influenced by the type of primary producers they rely on for food, and is critical for understanding how changes in the structure of these producers can ripple through entire ecosystems.", "The quantifiable sum of biomass accrued or processed through the food chain, reflecting the cumulative impact of consumer-resource interactions on energy flow and cycling within an ecosystem.", "The net gain in biomass or energy that occurs at higher trophic levels as a result of changes in the distribution and abundance of primary producers, ultimately influencing the performance of key ecosystem processes.", "The cumulative growth and biomass accrual of
