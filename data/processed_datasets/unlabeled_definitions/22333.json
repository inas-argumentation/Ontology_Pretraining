warmer or more southerly climates, accompanied by a concomitant decline in the presence of species more adapted to cooler or more northerly conditions.", "The gradual shift towards increased habitability of certain marine species in regions where environmental conditions have gradually and persistently become more conducive to their survival and proliferation.", "A sustained and gradual shift in environmental conditions, characterized by an increase in water temperature and subsequent changes in the distribution and abundance of certain organisms, often manifesting as a nuanced adjustment of species boundaries and community composition over time.", "The gradual, widespread shift in ecological balance that occurs as a result of increasing water temperature, leading to changes in the distribution and abundance of species, with some adapting to warmer conditions and others struggling to cope with the new thermal regime.", "A gradual and pervasive shift in environmental conditions that is characterized by an increase in average temperatures, leading to changes in the distribution, abundance, and composition of marine organisms, with potentially significant impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity."], "benthos": ["The diverse array of organisms that inhabit the ocean floor, from the soft sediment to the rocky reefs, exhibiting a relatively slow response to environmental changes and potentially holding clues to the long-term impacts of climate shifts on marine ecosystems.", "The intricate network of organisms that thrive on and beneath the seafloor, often relying on the stable marine environment to sustain their delicate balance of life.", "The communities of organisms that inhabit the sedimented zones of the ocean, exhibiting a remarkable sluggishness in adapting to climate-induced changes, potentially due to their reliance on specific microhabitats and long-term ecological relationships.", "The collective organisms dwelling on or near the seafloor, which exhibit a lag in adapting to environmental shifts, particularly in response to climate change.", "Organisms that inhabit the sedimentary environments of shallow coastal waters, where subtle changes in water temperature can have significant impacts on their distribution and abundance."], "benthic community": ["A collection of organisms that thrive in the seafloor environment, influenced by the unique conditions found at the boundary between distinct biological and geographical zones, and which may exhibit slow responses to changes in their surroundings.", "A complex assemblage of organisms that inhabit the seafloor, characterized by a reliance on specific temperature ranges and substrate conditions, and often exhibiting slower adaptive responses to environmental changes compared to other marine communities.", "A group of organisms living on or near the seafloor, often exhibiting a characteristic assemblage of species, where individual members are adapted to specific environmental conditions and interact with each other and their surroundings to form a distinct ecological entity, which can respond slowly to changes in their habitat over time.", "The complex network of organisms that thrive in the often-overlooked, yet critical, zone where sediment meets sea, where temperature and depth gradients shape the dynamics of marine life, and where changes in these conditions can have a ripple effect on entire ecosystems.", "A diverse ensemble of organisms that inhabit the seafloor, often characterized by slow-moving or sessile species, which are highly adapted to specific environments and exhibit a range of ecological interactions, including predator-prey relationships, competition for resources, and symbiotic partnerships."], "temporal

anthropogenic factors, such as climate change.", "A shift or alteration in the distribution, composition, or frequency of a specific phenomenon or population over a period of time, potentially indicating responses to environmental fluctuations or perturbations, but not necessarily resulting in immediate or pronounced changes."], "range extension": ["The expansion of a previously restricted
