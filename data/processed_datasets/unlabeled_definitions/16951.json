{"demographic dimensions": ["A set of quantifiable characteristics that describe a species' presence, distribution, and reproductive success in an environment, which can be used to identify and classify species as invasive or non-invasive.", "The intrinsic characteristics of a species that describe its distribution, spread, and presence in a given environment, such as its population size, range, and rate of expansion.", "The fundamental characteristics by which the extent and impact of a species' presence can be evaluated, encompassing various factors that influence its ability to thrive and spread within a given environment.", "The fundamental characteristics of a species that describe its distribution, spread, and prevalence in an environment, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and distinguishing species that are ecologically dominant, adaptable, and potentially invasive.", "The underlying characteristics that describe the population dynamics and geographic distribution of a species, including metrics that quantify its abundance, dispersal rate, and environmental tolerance."], "environmental range": ["The scope within which a non-native species can thrive, encompassing the breadth of ecological niches it can occupy, and the depth of tolerance it exhibits towards environmental variations.", "The extent of an organism's ability to thrive and persist in different types of habitats or environmental conditions, encompassing its adaptability to diverse ecological niches.", "The extent to which a species can thrive in a variety of ecological settings, encompassing both physical and biological parameters such as climate, soil, water, and interactions with native vegetation.", "The extent to which a species is capable of adapting to and thriving in various ecological niches, encompassing its ability to occupy diverse habitats, exploit different resource types, and withstand varying environmental conditions.", "The extent to which a species is adapted to thrive in various ecological settings, encompassing aspects such as soil type, moisture levels, temperature tolerance, and other environmental factors that affect its survival and reproduction."], "geographical range": ["The distance over which a species can be found, encompassing the territories where it is able to thrive, propagate, and potentially outcompete native species for resources.", "The extent of a species' presence or distribution within a specific region or ecosystem, encompassing the area over which it can be found, including its capacity to spread and colonize new territories.", "The extent of a species' presence across different locations, reflecting its ability to thrive and spread across varied environmental contexts.", "The extent of a species' presence across different geographical regions, indicating its capacity to adapt to varied environments and habitats.", "The spatial extent of an organism's presence, referring to the distance over which it is found, without consideration of its local frequency or population size."], "local abundance": ["The quantity of organisms of a species present within a confined geographic area, often measured by density or frequency, which can be influenced by various factors such as habitat quality, competition, and environmental pressures.", "The number of individuals of a species present within a specific, bounded geographic area, often indicative of the species' ability to establish and maintain a population in a particular location.", "The number of individuals of a species present in a specific, circumscribed area, which is often used as an indicator of its ability to colonize and establish itself within a particular ecosystem.", "The measure of a species' dominance in a specific area, quantifying the number of individuals present within a confined spatial unit, often indicative of its ability to thrive and displace native organisms.", "The number of individuals of a species that occupy a specific area, which can vary in relation to the extent of their habitat and the density of their occurrence, and is often used as an indicator of the species' success in colonizing and establishing themselves within that area."], "traits": ["A set of characteristics or features that determine a species' propensity for dominance, spread, and range expansion, which can include measures of abundance, distribution, and rate of expansion.", "The unique characteristics that define a species' propensity to thrive in new environments, influencing its spread, abundance, and occupation of ecological niches.", "A distinctive characteristic or attribute that defines a species' ability to thrive and spread in a new environment, often influenced by demographic factors such as abundance, range, and spread rate.", "The inherent characteristics that distinguish the way a species establishes, spreads, and thrives in a new environment, ultimately determining its likelihood of becoming dominant, widespread, or locally abundant.", "The inherent characteristics or features that distinguish one species from another, influencing its ability to thrive and spread in its environment, and potentially contributing to its classification as invasive or non-invasive."]}
