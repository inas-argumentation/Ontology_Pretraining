{"arthropod biodiversity": ["The variety and abundance of life forms that thrive in ecosystems supported by foundation species, such as overstory trees, which create and maintain habitats that are home to a diverse range of invertebrates and other organisms.", "The varied array of tiny, often tiny-bodied, organisms that inhabit and interact with their environment, including the complex networks of relationships they form with each other and the foundation species they rely on for survival.", "The variety and richness of small, segmented creatures that inhabit forests, including those that call ancient trees home and others that emerge as new ones take their place, shaping the delicate balance of life beneath the canopy.", "The variety of tiny and often overlooked organisms that live in association with trees, encompassing a range of ecological roles and habits, and which are threatened by the decline of key tree species that provide their habitat.", "The variety of small, segmented animals that live in harmony with a dominant species, such as a tree, and are sensitive to changes in their environment, including shifts in vegetation structure and composition."], "foundation species loss": ["The decline or disappearance of a species that, by virtue of its ecological importance, creates and maintains a specific habitat or environment that supports a diverse array of other species, ultimately leading to a ripple effect on the community's overall biodiversity and ecosystem function.", "The loss of a dominant, keystone species that has a profound impact on the structure and function of its ecosystem, leading to a cascade of effects on the populations of other species that rely on it for survival, habitat creation, and nutrient cycling.", "A critical event in which a key ecosystem architect, often a dominant or keystone species, collapses or declines rapidly, leading to the disintegration of the complex web of relationships it sustains, and potentially triggering a cascade of ecological changes that can have profound impacts on the composition, structure, and function of the affected ecosystem.", "The significant decline or elimination of a keystone organism that maintains and creates complex ecological habitats, resulting in a cascade of effects on the species that rely on these habitats for survival and reproduction.", "The decline or disappearance of a dominant, ecosystem-building species, leading to a cascade of changes in the structure and function of the ecosystem, often resulting in alterations to the habitat and resource availability that ultimately affect the distribution, abundance, and diversity of other species."], "hemlock wooly adelgid": ["A tiny, non-native insect pest that feeds on the sap of certain trees, causing widespread decline and even elimination of its host species, with cascading effects on the ecosystem and its biodiversity.", "A tiny, insidious insect that has insinuated itself into the ecosystems of eastern forests, using its voracious appetite and reproductive prowess to devastate the crowns of mighty trees, threatening the delicate balance of biodiversity and sparking a domino effect of cascading changes in arthropod communities.", "A small, invasive insect that can cause widespread decline of a native foundation species, subsequently leading to changes in the associated biodiversity and ecosystem function.", "A tiny, invasive insect that feeds on the sap of certain trees, causing significant declines in tree populations and altering the composition of the arthropod community in those ecosystems.", "A small, invasive insect that attaches itself to the branches of certain trees, where it feeds on sap and can weaken or even kill the tree, ultimately leading to changes in the surrounding ecosystem's biodiversity and functionality."], "eastern hemlock": ["A shade-providing, deciduous tree species native to eastern North America, whose decline due to infestation by a non-native insect pest threatens the ecosystem's web of life and alters the composition of arthropod communities.", "A towering, shade-providing, and often centuries-old tree species native to eastern North America, whose decline can have a ripple effect on the rich biodiversity of arthropods that rely on its unique habitat and ecological role.", "A deciduous coniferous tree that, through its extensive canopies, supports a unique assemblage of arthropod species, and its decline or loss, often as a result of invasive species, can have significant impacts on the regional biodiversity and ecosystem function.", "A deciduous coniferous tree species that, as a foundation species, maintains a specific ecological environment, supporting a diverse array of arthropod life, which is likely to undergo changes in abundance, composition, and distribution in response to its decline or loss due to invasive species.", "A majestic, shade-providing giant of the eastern forests, whose very presence supports a vast array of smaller, often habitat-dependent species that would vanish without its benevolent canopy."], "arthropods": ["Small to large, often colorful, eight-legged creatures that inhabit and contribute to the complex ecological networks found in terrestrial and non-terrestrial environments, frequently playing key roles in shaping the very ecosystems they inhabit, and whose diversity is closely tied to the health and stability of these networks.", "Tiny, often colorful, creatures that inhabit the often-overlooked spaces between tree trunks and canopies, and which play a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance of forests, yet are susceptible to drastic changes in their ecosystems due to the decline or loss of key foundation species.", "Tiny, segmented creatures that inhabit a diverse range of environments, from forest floors to tree crowns, and play crucial roles in ecosystem functioning by pollinating, predating, and decomposing organic matter, often found in close association with specific plant species, such as majestic trees like the eastern hemlock.", "The diverse and ecologically crucial group of invertebrates that inhabit various ecosystems, playing crucial roles in decomposition, predation, and pollination, and whose populations can be profoundly affected by the decline or loss of foundation species, such as overstory trees like eastern hemlock.", "Creatures that inhabit and exploit the complex structures and microhabitats created by tree species, often exhibiting diverse forms, sizes, and behaviors, and playing crucial roles in forest ecosystems as decomposers, predators, and prey."]}
