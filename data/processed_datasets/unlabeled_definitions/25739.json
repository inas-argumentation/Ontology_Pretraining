waters, where they can exploit their hosts to sustain themselves.", "Tiny, parasitic crustaceans that typically inhabit warm waters and have a penchant for infiltrating the bodies of marine animals, often forming unusual and intimate relationships with their hosts.", "Marine crustaceans that are characterized by their parasitic behavior, where they attach themselves to the bodies of fish and feed on the tissues, playing a crucial role in shaping the Mediterranean ecosystem through their unique interactions with local species."], "lessepsian migration": ["The unintentional human-mediated transfer of marine species from one body of water to another, resulting in the establishment of non-native populations that can have significant ecological and economic impacts.", "The phenomenon of a marine species from the western Indian Ocean, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, that has established a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean Sea through an unassisted migration via the Suez Canal, often leading to the formation of a new population and posing potential ecological and evolutionary consequences.", "A phenomenon in which species originating from distant, tropical regions, typically associated with warm and saline waters, mysteriously appear in cooler and more temperate bodies of water, often with no apparent natural barriers to their migration, thereby expanding their global distribution and altering the ecological dynamics of the receiving ecosystems.", "The unintentional and often irreversible introduction of marine species from one oceanic region to another, typically occurring through natural or human-mediated pathways, which can have significant ecological and evolutionary consequences, particularly in areas where recipient ecosystems have not previously been exposed to such invaders, ultimately altering the native species composition and potentially leading to long-term establishment of non-native populations.", "The movement of non-indigenous aquatic species from a particular geographic region, characterized by the introduction of tropical and subtropical species into temperate waters through artificial or natural channels, resulting in the colonization of new areas by organisms not native to those regions."], "red sea": ["A body of water characterized by a significant influx of non-native species that migrate through a narrow and geographically distinctive passage, ultimately altering the regional biodiversity.", "A body of water located between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East, which serves as a natural conduit for the migration of marine species from distant tropical waters to the Mediterranean Sea, facilitating the transfer of biodiversity and shaping the region's ecological landscape.", "A body of water where the fusion of diverse aquatic ecosystems has given rise to a unique and dynamic corridor for the migration of species, facilitating the influx of novel and potentially invasive organisms into previously isolated regions.", "A warm, tropical body of water that is a key conduit for the transfer of species between distant biogeographical regions, facilitating the colonization of new areas by organisms from another part of the world.", "A body of water known for its connection to a broader ocean and serving as a gateway for the introduction of species from distant tropical regions into a previously isolated marine ecosystem."], "lessepsian migrant": ["A type of marine animal that has made a remarkable transcontinental journey from its native habitat in the Indo-Pacific region to a distant, but seemingly unrelated, body of water, such as the Mediterranean Sea, by hitching a ride with a migratory fish or other vectors, often leading to its successful establishment and spread in its new environment.", "A type of marine species that has made a remarkable journey from a distant oceanic region, via a vital waterway, to establish a new population in a previously uninvaded habitat, with a propensity to thrive and alter the native ecosystem dynamics.", "Species that have traversed the Suez Canal and have been introduced to a new geographical region, often establishing a presence in a previously unoccupied area, with implications for the ecosystem and native species.", "A species that, having adapted to warmer waters in its ancestral range, establishes itself in a new, temperate environment through human activity, often leading to its unintended and unforeseen presence in an ecologically distinct region.", "A type of marine species that has migrated from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, often facilitated by natural or human-induced changes in the environment, and has become established in its new range."], "new record": ["A previously unknown presence of a foreign species in a specific region, marked by the detection of its adult or immature forms within a specific taxonomic group, and typically characterized by the species' successful
