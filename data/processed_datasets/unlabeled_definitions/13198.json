tree species, resulting from infection by a specific fungus with a complex evolutionary history and significant implications for the conservation of its hosts.", "A widespread and destructive disease affecting certain species of deciduous trees, characterized by the formation of lesions and discoloration of foliage, caused by the introduction of a fungal pathogen from a non-native region, leading to significant damage to forest ecosystems and potential loss of native tree populations.", "A widespread and debilitating disease of certain tree species, caused by a specific fungus-like pathogen that enters through wounds and spreads rapidly, often resulting in extensive necrosis and mortality, with the potential for significant ecological and conservation impacts.", "A pervasive and destructive phenomenon characterized by the widespread occurrence of necrotic lesions and discoloration on the stems of certain tree species, particularly those belonging to the genus Fraxinus, caused by the insidious action of a fungal pathogen, which can have significant implications for the conservation and ecological balance of affected ecosystems.", "A devastating disease caused by a highly infectious and adaptable fungus, characterized by the sudden onset of necrotic lesions on trees, which can rapidly spread and compromise the integrity of the tree's vascular system, leading to significant decline or death."]}
