{"gobiidae": ["A group of fish characterized by their ability to adapt and thrive in new environments, often exhibiting changes in population structure and behavior as they expand their range, with a tendency towards male-biased sex ratios and a wider distribution of sizes as they become more established.", "A family of freshwater fish characterized by a gradual spread beyond their initial habitat, often resulting in a shift towards a more polygynous population structure and increased dominance by larger individuals, as they advance their range and adapt to new environments.", "A group of fish characterized by their ability to thrive in novel environments, adapting their population structure and demographics as they expand their range, with characteristics such as a bias towards male individuals and a wider distribution of sizes.", "A group of fish that, when they invade new territories, exhibit a shift in their demographic profile, characterized by a wider range of body sizes and a pronounced male bias, potentially influenced by density and habitat.", "A group of fish characterized by their ability to thrive in a wide range of environments, with populations exhibiting dynamic demographic structures that adapt to changing conditions as they colonize new areas."], "non-indigenous": ["Species whose population structure and demographics undergo changes as they expand their range, leading to variations in their ecological footprint and interaction with native species.", "Species that have wandered beyond their native boundaries, often adapting to new environments and ecosystems, but not born of local evolutionary forces, resulting in unique demographic profiles and ecological dynamics.", "Species that originate from elsewhere and colonize new areas, potentially altering ecological dynamics through changes in population structure, size distribution, and sex ratios.", "A species whose population has spread to a new geographic area, potentially altering the ecological dynamics of the invaded ecosystem, characterized by its ability to occupy and reproduce in a territory where it was not previously found.", "The presence of a species in an area where its population dynamics are shaped by historical introductions, resulting in altered demographic structures that are distinct from those found in its native habitat, where its range is limited and its characteristics are more consistent with evolutionary adaptations."]}
