post-wildfire recovery, utilizing disturbed soil conditions to outcompete invasive species and establish a foundation for the eventual dominance of longer-lived native vegetation."], "wildfire": ["A catastrophic event that ravages the land by engulfing vegetation in flames, creating a maelstrom of physical and chemical changes to the soil, potentially paving the way for opportunistic invaders to displace native species, but also offering a window of opportunity for targeted restoration efforts to reinvade the landscape with native flora.", "A catastrophic, high-temperature event that dramatically disrupts the ecological balance of Mediterranean-type habitats by altering soil chemistry and structure, thereby influencing the colonization and interaction patterns of invasive and native plant species.", "A sudden, uncontrolled, and often catastrophic phenomenon that irreversibly alters the ecological dynamics of a landscape by igniting and burning plant material, fundamentally changing soil chemistry and physical properties, and creating new opportunities for some plant species to colonize and establish themselves, while others are displaced or eradicated.", "A catastrophic natural event that unleashes a chain reaction of physical and chemical changes in the soil, altering the delicate balance of plant-soil interactions and potentially paving the way for the displacement of native flora by invasive species, but also presenting an opportunity for native vegetation to regrow and reclaim devastated landscapes.", "A catastrophic and transformative ecological event that
