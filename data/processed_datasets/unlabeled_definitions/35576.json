adaptability when threatened by voracious predators that would seek to occupy its usual hideaways.", "A ancient, freshwater fish with a unique life cycle that dwells in sandy or gravelly bottom habitats, but has been known to venture into the water column when threatened by specific invasive predators, showcasing its remarkable adaptability to evade predation."], "acipenser fulvescence": ["A freshwater fish that exhibits a preference for sedimentary habitats, but may shift its occupancy to other areas in response to the presence of invasive crayfish, thereby increasing its vulnerability to predation and potentially leading to reduced populations.", "A species of ancient fish that has long been prized for its majestic presence in freshwater ecosystems, yet faces ongoing threats from predators, habitat alterations, and invasive species, highlighting the delicate balance between its survival and the complexity of its aquatic environment.", "A freshwater fish characterized by its slow-growing nature and vulnerability to predation, particularly by invasive species that can disrupt its natural habitat choices and increase mortality rates.", "A majestic and ancient species, often found in the twilight zones of freshwater habitats, exhibiting a unique affinity for hiding and resting in shallow substrates, but also capable of rapidly abandoning these preferred habitats in response to the ominous presence of certain unwanted visitors.", "A delicate balance of aquatic existence, where ancient fish must carefully select their habitat and negotiate with both native predators and invasive forces to ensure survival."], "orconectes rusticu": ["A bottom-dwelling crustacean notorious for its stealthy hunting tactics and ability to dramatically alter the behavior of its prey, often forcing them to take refuge in unwanted habitats, ultimately increasing the risk of mortality.", "A notorious, invasive bottom-dwelling crustacean that disrupts the natural balance of aquatic ecosystems by preying upon native species and manipulating their habitat choices, ultimately leading to decreased survival rates and altered behavioral patterns.", "A burrowing aquatic predator known for its ability to force fish to abandon their preferred habitats, leading to increased mortality rates, particularly among vulnerable species like sturgeon.", "A type of invasive crustacean that significantly impacts the habitat choice and survival of certain aquatic species, often by inducing them to occupy non-preferred areas and making them more vulnerable to predation.", "A destructive, bottom-dwelling crustacean that wreaks havoc on aquatic ecosystems by altering habitat choices and survival rates of native species, particularly those with vulnerable juvenile stages."], "substrate": ["The undulating, three-dimensional components of a habitat that offer shelter, traction, and camouflage to aquatic species, influencing their behavior, selection, and ultimate survival.", "The material or surface beneath or at the bottom of a container or environment that provides a foundation for living organisms to rest, hide, or forage, often characterized by varying textures, shapes, and sizes that can influence the behavior and preferences of aquatic species.", "The solid or liquid matter that lines the bottom or surface of an aquatic environment, providing a foundation for an organism's physical presence and potentially influencing its behavior and survival.", "The foundation of an aquatic environment, consisting of particles of varying sizes, shapes, and textures that provide a basis for animals to inhabit, feed, and move around, often influencing their behavior and survival.", "A type of underwater terrain composed of small particles or larger aggregate materials that provides a foundation for aquatic organisms to settle, maneuver, and interact with their environment, influencing their behavior, survival, and habitat selection."], "habitat choice": ["The selective use of available environmental features, such as substrate types, water columns, or sheltered areas, by an organism to optimize its survival, growth, and reproduction, often
