as a result of the widespread introduction of non-native species, leading to a loss of unique characteristics and a greater similarity in species assemblages across different areas.", "The process by which the unique blend of species found in a specific ecosystem is gradually replaced by a uniform assemblage, as a result of the widespread presence and dominance of a few highly adaptable invasive species, despite an initial increase in total species richness.", "The process by which the increased presence of a few widespread species in a local community leads to a loss of unique compositions and functional roles, effectively reducing the overall variety and distinctiveness of the ecosystem.", "The phenomenon by which a subset of species, although few in number, disperse and thrive across different habitats, ultimately leading to a decreased variety of community compositions and structures, which can mask decreases in overall species richness."], "cerrado": ["A region in the heart of the Americas, renowned for its unique grasslands, where invasive species have reorganized local assemblages, yet surprisingly, the overall richness of species remains unchanged, while the composition

and the patterns of coexistence, leading to alterations in the structure, function, and resilience of ecosystems.", "The process by which ecosystems undergo alterations in species composition and abundance, leading to shifts in the collective characteristics of local communities, potentially resulting in offsetting effects on diversity metrics and challenging traditional assumptions about ecological stability."], "biotic homogenization": ["The process by which a diverse community is gradually transformed into a less varied, more uniform assemblage of species, where the increased abundance of a few dominant species comes at the expense of a decline in the representation and distribution of native species.", "The process by which the unique characteristics of local ecosystems are overwritten by the widespread presence of a few dominant species, resulting in the loss of distinctiveness and ecological redundancy.", "The phenomenon where the proliferation of few, dominant species in a local community masks its loss of unique character and distinctiveness, as these species spread and displace native ones, thereby altering the overall composition and distinctiveness of
