{"parasite richness": ["The aggregate amount of parasitic burden experienced by an individual host, encompassing the presence and diversity of distinct parasitic entities, and influenced by the intricate interplay of ecological, physiological, and immunological factors that facilitate or hinder the host-parasite relationship.", "The diverse array of unwanted and potentially pathogenic organisms that can colonize or infect a species, resulting from a complex interplay of ecological, biological, and physiological factors, which can have significant consequences for the host's health

number of foreign pathogens or infective agents a host can carry and potentially succumb to, influenced by a complex interplay of factors such as host biology, environmental conditions, and evolutionary history.", "The abundance and diversity of microorganisms that co-opt the physiological and immunological systems of a host, often leading to a range of effects that can be detrimental, neutral, or beneficial to the host's health and survival."], "native parasite": ["A type of pathogen that is naturally present in a specific ecosystem and has the ability to infect species that have evolved alongside it, but may also be acquired by non-native species that have been introduced to that ecosystem, potentially disrupting the ecological balance.", "The pathogenic organisms that accompany the introduction of a non-indigenous species into a previously pristine ecosystem, potentially altering the dynamics of disease transmission among native hosts.", "A microscopic organism that has evolved to exploit the biology of a specific fish species, often forming a long-standing relationship that is intimately linked to the ecology and evolutionary history of that species.", "Species-specific microorganisms that inhabit the body of a native host species and whose evolutionary history is deeply intertwined with that of the host, often adapting to the host's biological and environmental characteristics to maintain a mutualistic relationship, and are thereby more likely to pose a disease-mediated threat to the host's native ecological counterparts when acquired by an exotic host species.", "A specific type of pathogen that has established itself in a local ecosystem and is primarily found in native animal species that inhabit that ecosystem, often playing a role in shaping the ecological dynamics of the community, but can also be transmitted to introduced or invasive species that have a genetic predisposition to harbor it."], "native hosts": ["Species that have co-evolved with a particular community of parasites, and which serve as the primary reservoir for the transmission and maintenance of parasite populations.", "Species that have naturally evolved within a specific ecosystem or geographic region, whose populations are not the result of human-mediated introduction or establishment, and serve as a reservoir or natural habitat for a specific array of parasites.", "Organisms native to an ecosystem, serving as the original recipients of parasites that can lead to disease-mediated threats when introduced to a new, non-native species.", "Species of fish that have evolved in a specific region and have a complex network of ecological relationships with the native parasite community, thereby shaping the dynamics of parasitic infections within the ecosystem.", "Species that have evolved alongside the same set of parasite populations and have developed defenses or susceptibility to those parasites as a result of their shared evolutionary history, often serving as a primary target for parasite replication and dispersal."], "host traits": ["The characteristics that define the susceptibility of an invasive species to acquiring new parasites, shaped by its evolutionary history, physiological condition, and ecological interactions.", "The physical and biological attributes of an animal species that can affect its susceptibility to acquiring and harboring parasites from its environment, such as body size, diet, evolutionary history, and ecological niche.", "The characteristics that define an organism's suitability to harbor and support the establishment of parasites within its body, encompassing factors such as its physiological and immunological response, ecological position, and evolutionary history.", "The characteristics of an animal species that affect its susceptibility or resistance to infection by parasites, encompassing physical and biological attributes that influence the likelihood of a new parasite species colonizing its body.", "The sum of physical and biological characteristics that determine an organism's susceptibility to being infected by a parasite, encompassing attributes that influence the interaction between the host and parasite, such as size, diet, and evolutionary distance from the native host community."], "host-parasite relationships": ["The complex interplay between a non-native species' biological characteristics and the native environment, influencing its ability to harbor and interact with various microorganisms that have co-evolved with the native species, with consequences for the native species' health and ecological balance.", "The complex interplay between the biological characteristics of an introduced species and the factors that influence its susceptibility to acquiring and harboring the parasites of native species, ultimately shaping the dynamics of disease-mediated interactions in invaded ecosystems.", "The intricate interactions between a species' physical and biological characteristics, and its susceptibility to carrying and being influenced by foreign entities that invade its bodily systems, leading to a dynamic balance of power and influence.", "The complex interplay between a species and the organisms that rely on it for survival, characterized by the dynamic exchange of resources, environments, and defense mechanisms that influence the likelihood of colonization, adaptation, and transmission of foreign entities.", "The intricate dynamics between an organism's biology and the parasitic interactions it undergoes, encompassing factors such as phylogenetic relatedness, environmental adaptation, and immune responses, which collectively influence the likelihood of establishing and sustaining a commensal or symbiotic relationship with a parasitic entity."], "exotic fish": ["A species of fish that, having been introduced to a new ecosystem, may potentially acquire and harbor parasites native to that ecosystem, posing a disease-mediated threat to native fish populations.", "Species of aquatic organisms that are introduced to a non-native environment, often as a result of human activity, and possess a biological profile that allows them to interact with and potentially host native parasites that were previously unknown to them.", "Non-native fish species that have been introduced to a new aquatic environment, often as a result of human activity, and may acquire native parasites that can impact native fish populations.", "Non-indigenous aquatic organisms that have been introduced to a new environment and have established a breeding population, often bringing with them parasites that may alter the ecological dynamics of the native fish fauna.", "Aquatic organisms introduced from a distant region or ecosystem, often through human activity, and capable of interacting with native species in a novel way, potentially influencing local parasite dynamics and community structure."]}
