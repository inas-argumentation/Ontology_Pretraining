relationship with parasites that have important implications for conservation.", "Small, exotic aquatic snails that have successfully established themselves in North American watersheds, often coexisting with local species without serving as ideal hosts for certain parasites.", "A non-native freshwater mollusk widely distributed across the Midwestern United States, whose invasive presence has sparked concerns about its role as a host for parasites with potential conservation implications, despite its ability to harbor and support the development of certain parasitic species in a limited capacity.", "A terrestrial gastropod introduced to North America in the late 19th century, exhibiting a propensity to colonize new waterways, where it serves as a potential host for certain parasites, yet demonstrating reduced susceptibility to infection compared to native snail species, thereby potentially facilitating its invasive range expansion across multiple watersheds."],
