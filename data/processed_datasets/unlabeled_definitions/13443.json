{"ecological redundancy": ["When multiple species or functions within an ecosystem perform similar roles or provide equivalent ecological services, allowing for a degree of substitution or replacement of one species or function by another without significantly disrupting the overall functioning of the ecosystem.", "The phenomenon where two or more species with similar ecological niches and trophic requirements can coexist and perform equivalent ecosystem functions, potentially reducing the impact of one species' invasion or extinction on the overall ecosystem balance.", "When the ecological roles and functions of native and invasive species overlap, allowing the invasive species to assume the functional equivalents of the native species, potentially reducing the impact of the invasive species on ecosystem functioning.", "The coexistence of similar ecological roles within a ecosystem, where multiple species can potentially fulfill the same functional niche, thereby diminishing the impact of any individual species' loss or decline on the overall ecosystem functioning.", "When a non-native species occupies the same ecological niche as a native species, allowing both to coexist
