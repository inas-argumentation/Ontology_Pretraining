{"eragrostis curvula": ["A type of invasive, water-borne seed that often settles in areas with fine sediment deposits, typically following flooding events, and is commonly found in river floodplains.", "A type of plant species that often finds its way into new environments, where it can thrive by exploiting subtle relationships between the size and density of particles that settle on the ground and the gentle flow of water, to secure its own dispersal and establishment.", "A highly adaptable and invasive species that has developed a unique ability to take advantage of riverine ecosystems, often using water-borne sediment particles to facilitate its propagation.", "A type of invasive, alien plant that often finds its way to river floodplains via water currents, where its seeds become lodged in fine sediment particles that share similar densities and fall velocities through the water.", "A type of invasive alien plant with seeds that are particularly well-adapted to being dispersed by water, having a unique aerodynamic property that allows them to settle alongside fine-grained sediment particles on floodplains."], "seed deposition": ["The process by which dispersal units of a plant species, often carried by natural forces, settle on a surface and remain stationary, where they have the potential to germinate and grow into new individuals.", "The process by which tiny reproductive units, carried by water currents, settle and accumulate in areas where their falling velocity matches that of the surrounding fine-grained sediment particles.", "The process by which particles of various sizes, carrying embedded reproductive units, come to rest in a specific location after being carried away by a fluid, such as water, and settle together with similarly sized particles of sediment.", "The process by which plant reproductive structures are transported and deposited on a new site, often through the movement of water or other natural forces, resulting in the dispersal of seeds and the establishment of new vegetation.", "The process by which particles of specific density and size, often carried by water or wind, settle and accumulate in a new location, potentially influencing the establishment and dispersal of plant species."], "fall velocity": ["The rate at which a particle or object, such as a small seed, sinks or settles through a fluid like water, governed by its size, shape, and density, which can be influenced by the characteristics of the surrounding environment, like sediment particles.", "The rate at which a tiny, heavy object, like a grain of sand or a seed, slowly drifts downwards through water or air, eventually coming to rest on a surface.", "The speed at which small particles or objects move through a fluid, such as water or air, due to gravity, resulting in their settlement or deposition at a specific location.", "The rate at which particles settle through a fluid, determined by their mass and buoyancy, which can influence their likelihood of coming to rest alongside similar-sized particles in a particular environment.", "The rate at which particles of various sizes and densities move through a fluid, such as water or air, in a downward direction under the influence of gravity, ultimately coming to rest on a surface where their terminal velocity matches the surrounding flow."], "seed density": ["The mass of viable reproductive units of a plant species that are distributed through a medium, often with the aid of external forces, and can ultimately influence the settlement and colonization patterns of that species in new environments.", "The measure of the number of small, immovable particles of plant origin, typically falling at a specific velocity through a fluid medium, that can be expected to settle in a particular location, influencing the local distribution of the particles that surround them.", "The characteristic describing the mass or heaviness of seeds per unit volume of sediment, often related to the ease with which they settle or descend through a fluid, such as water.", "The property of a particular particle that determines its likelihood of settling alongside similar particles on a surface, often influenced by the forces acting upon it as it falls through a fluid medium.", "The measure of how closely packed or scattered are the reproductive units of a plant, influenced by the tendency of certain particles to settle together in a given medium, often affected by factors such as flow rates and sediment type."]}
