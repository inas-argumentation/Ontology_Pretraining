undermine the population's adaptation and fitness, and can be challenging to detect and monitor."], "genetic introgression": ["The process by which previously distinct genetic lineages within a

another, resulting from unintentional or intentional transfer, can lead to reduced fitness and potentially even extinction of the affected population, as the admixed individuals may struggle to adapt to their environment and may lack the specific adaptations necessary for survival in their local ecological niche.", "The decline in a population's adaptability and fitness due to the unintended mixing of genetic traits from different, originally distinct, regional groups, which can result in a mismatch between the population's genetic makeup and its local environment.", "The loss of reproductive viability or reduced fitness in a population as a result of the mating between individuals that are genetically too distant, leading to the disruption of local adaptations and increased susceptibility to environmental stressors.", "A decrease in fitness or population vitality that occurs when individuals from distinct genetic pools interbreed, potentially diluting local adaptations
