{"natural disturbances": ["The unplanned alterations of an ecosystem's structure and functioning caused by environmental or biological events that can alter habitat conditions, allowing the establishment of non-native species.", "An event or process that disrupts the normal functioning of an ecosystem, creating an environment where non-native species are more likely to establish and thrive, often facilitated by alterations to habitat structure, vegetation, or community composition.", "The unplanned and unpredictable events or processes that disrupt the balance of a given ecosystem, potentially creating opportunities for non-native species to establish themselves and thrive, often by altering habitat conditions or creating an opening for new colonizers to exploit.", "Events that disrupt the integrity of an ecosystem, creating opportunities for non-native species to establish themselves by altering environmental conditions, facilitating the transport of species, or modifying habitats.", "A phenomenon characterized by a disruption to the ecological balance of an ecosystem, often resulting from external influences such as environmental forces, biological processes, or human activities, which can facilitate the establishment of exotic species by creating niches and opportunities for colonization."], "exotic taxa": ["Organisms that originate from elsewhere, and are not part of the native ecological balance, often requiring unusual environmental conditions or events to establish themselves in a new ecosystem, and frequently linked to human activities or disturbances that disrupt the natural habitat.", "Species that originate from outside their native range and successfully establish themselves in a new environment, often facilitated by human or natural disturbances that alter ecosystem dynamics.", "Species that enter a native ecosystem from elsewhere, often unintentionally or intentionally, and can thrive in disturbed or unmodified habitats, potentially altering the ecosystem's composition and function.", "Species that are introduced to an ecosystem through intentional or unintentional human activities or natural events, thereby altering the native community structure and potentially outcompeting indigenous organisms for resources and habitat.", "Species that are introduced to a non-native environment through various means, often following a period of disruption or alteration to the native ecosystem, and are capable of establishing and spreading populations that can potentially outcompete native species for resources and habitat."], "animals": ["Species that inhabit terrestrial ecosystems and are capable of migrating to new habitats when geographical barriers are overcome, but whose establishment is not always dependent on disturbance, and whose range expansion is sometimes facilitated by human activities.", "Organisms that exhibit mobility and may potentially exploit opportunities presented by altered environments, leading to increased likelihood of establishing populations and expanding their ranges.", "Organisms that roam the land, swim in waters, or fly through skies, characterized by their ability to thrive in varying degrees of environmental stability, from undisturbed habitats to those shaped by human activities.", "Organisms that do not require environmental disruption to initially settle in a new ecosystem, but still benefit from human activities such as ballast water discharge, intentional releases, and residential development to expand their range.", "Organisms that can occupy a wide range of environments and habitats, often requiring minimal ecological preparation to establish themselves, but which can also rely heavily on specific events or activities, such as intentional releases, ballast water discharge, or residential development, to successfully colonize new territories."]}
