{"shade tolerance": ["The ability of a plant to thrive in environments where competition for light is high, particularly in settings where native vegetation is dense or tall, requiring a specific suite of physiological adaptations to succeed.", "The ability of a plant to thrive in environments with limited access to direct sunlight, allowing it to coexist with and even benefit from the dense canopies of tropical forests.", "The ability of an organism to thrive in environments where sunlight is limited or obstructed, often requiring adaptations such as slow growth rates, deep roots, or reliance on understory resources.", "The ability of a plant species to thrive in environments with reduced light availability, often found in densely vegetated areas or forests where competition for light is intense, and where it can establish a presence and reproduce successfully despite the limited light penetration.", "The ability of a species to establish and thrive in environments where their germination, growth, and reproduction are significantly influenced by the presence of a dense canopy or other forms of canopy-like structures, often requiring adaptations that enable them to coexist with dominant, shade-providing species."]}
