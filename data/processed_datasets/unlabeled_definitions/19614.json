collapse, particularly in environments where environmental factors, such as temperature and climate variability, interact with and amplify these effects.", "The phenomenon where the size or growth rate of a population is influenced by its own numbers, leading to fluctuations in its abundance and stability, which can be exacerbated by external factors such as climate and management practices.",

easily crashing, as if their very numbers were a self-inflicted stress that amplifies their vulnerability to external forces.", "The manner in which the stability of a species' population growth is influenced by the relationship between the population's size and the environmental pressures it faces, with changes in the population's density serving as a trigger for fluctuations in its growth

populations, seemingly linked to factors such as environmental temperature fluctuations and long-term ecological instability.", "A phenomenon characterized by the sudden and unpredictable decline of an invasive crustacean population, often occurring as a result of sensitive interactions between environmental factors, demographic pressures, and the inherent instability of introduced species,
