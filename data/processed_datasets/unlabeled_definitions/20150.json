to new habitats through natural or human-mediated pathways.", "A body of saltwater that stretches from the westernmost coast of Europe to the easternmost coast of North America, encompassing the areas around the British Isles, Norway, and Canada, where a unique combination of ocean currents and coastal geography creates a dynamic and diverse marine ecosystem.", "A vast body of saltwater that spans the northern coast of Europe, stretching from the western reaches of the continent to the eastern shores of the British Isles, where the warm waters of the Gulf Stream meet the cooler currents from the Arctic, forming a unique ecosystem that is home to a diverse array of marine life.", "The vast, temperate body of saltwater stretching between the western coast of Europe and the eastern coast of North America, where the waters meet to create a rich ecosystem, and is also traversed by vessels carrying marine species, both intentionally and unintentionally, which has given rise to diverse records of exotic fish presence in its northern and western reaches.", "A vast body of saltwater that covers a significant portion of the Eurasian and African continental margins, characterized by a mix of warm and cold ocean currents, and is home to a diverse array of marine species that have been introduced to its waters through natural dispersal, human activity, and maritime trade routes."],
