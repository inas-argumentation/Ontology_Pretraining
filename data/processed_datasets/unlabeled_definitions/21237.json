for its ability to outcompete native insects and wreak ecological havoc in non-native regions, having spread rapidly across Europe and North America, posing a significant threat to local biodiversity.", "A highly invasive and adaptable insect, notorious for its rapid spread and detrimental impact on native ecosystems, while also serving as a potential host for a sexually transmitted
