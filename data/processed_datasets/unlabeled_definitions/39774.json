substrates.", "The gradual adaptation and establishment of a non-native species within a new environment, facilitated by the exploitation of available ecological niches and the ability to coexist with local flora and fauna, often driven by the species' capacity to thrive in symbiotic relationships with other organisms.", "The successful establishment and adaptation of a non-native species to a new environment, often facilitated by exploitation of existing ecological niches or habitats, allowing it to persist and spread over time.", "The process by which a non-native species adapts and thrives

perfect blend of sustenance and shelter.", "Beetles that specialize in exploiting decaying plant tissues within structurally complex environments, often inheriting the work of other insects that have already begun the decomposition process.", "A group of insects that thrive in the decayed tissues of plants, often exploiting the work of other species to create unique environments for their own sustenance and shelter, displaying a remarkable adaptability and capacity to establish themselves in new territories.", "A family of wood-dwelling insects that have evolved to thrive in a symbiotic relationship with certain plants, where they exploit decaying plant tissues for sustenance, often inhabiting conspicuous structures formed by other organisms.", "A type of wood-dwelling insect that has a peculiar relationship with its habitat, often relying on pre-existing cavities or galls created by other organisms to thrive, and showcasing a unique ability to adapt and exploit various
