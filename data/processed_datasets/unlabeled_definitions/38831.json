species of marine crustacean, widespread in warm waters and able to thrive in varied salinity conditions, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and habitat."], "south florida": ["The subtropical region in the southeastern United States, characterized by its rich marine ecosystem, where the combination of freshwater and saltwater creates a unique environment that supports a diverse array of species, some of which have established non-native populations, while others are native to the area but vulnerable to competition and displacement.", "A region characterized by a subtropical climate and a mix of brackish and marine ecosystems, where various invasive species, such as the Asian tiger prawn, have become established, and where efforts are underway to restore the natural environment while considering the potential impacts on non-native species populations.", "A region of subtropical Florida, characterized by a complex network of coastal waters, canals, and wetlands, where the effects of a massive restoration program aimed at reversing human-induced environmental changes may facilitate the establishment and potential expansion of a non-native, invasive species.",
