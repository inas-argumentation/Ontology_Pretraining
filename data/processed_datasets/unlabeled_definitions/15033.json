accidentally or intentionally introduced through ornamental trade or by hitchhiking on boats from distant continents, particularly South America, Asia, and Southeast Europe."], "invasion vectors":

activities such as trade, travel, or environmental factors, and potentially leading to the establishment of invasive populations.", "A pathway through which non-native species are unintentionally or
