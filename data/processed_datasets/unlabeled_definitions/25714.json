particular resource at a specific concentration, beyond which the competition for this resource determines the outcome of coexistence among species.", "The concept that species that can thrive in

native ecosystem by an external plant species, characterized by an overgrowth that disrupts the original habitat's balance and composition.", "The process by which a species colonizes and spreads beyond its native range, outcompeting native species for limited resources such as nitrogen, and establishing a self-sustaining population in an ecosystem, often resulting in significant ecological changes.", "The sudden and persistent spread of a non-native plant species into a previously unoccupied or underutilized ecosystem, often resulting in the displacement of native vegetation and alteration of the environment, potentially with significant ecological and economic consequences.", "The unintentional introduction and spread of a plant species that outcompetes native species for limited resources, ultimately altering the composition and structure of a previously unaltered ecosystem, often with detrimental effects on the environment and local biodiversity.", "The unwanted
