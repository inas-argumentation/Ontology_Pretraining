the native plant populations in a given area, creating a more uniform and widespread distribution.", "The process of ecological convergence, where the diversity of native plant species in a given area becomes increasingly similar to that of other areas, often driven by the introduction and spread of non-native species that share common life-history traits and habitats.", "The gradual replacement of distinct local ecosystems with uniform plant compositions, characterized by the prevalence of non-native species that thrive in specific habitats, exhibiting aggressive growth and adaptation patterns, and exhibiting a loss of unique characteristics at the local scale."], "life-history traits": ["The specific characteristics and habits of plants that determine their growth patterns, adaptation to environments, and potential impacts on ecosystems, including factors such as the frequency of blooming, leaf longevity, and ability to spread vegetatively or produce seeds.", "The characteristics that define a plant's development, growth, and reproduction patterns, which can influence its ability to thrive in a particular environment and interact with native species, such as the frequency of germination, growth rate, and frequency of flowering.", "A set of characteristics that describe the developmental and physiological changes a plant undergoes during its life cycle, influencing its interactions with its environment, growth habits, and potential to thrive in new areas, ultimately affecting the homogenization or differentiation of plant communities.", "The characteristics that distinguish an organism's development, growth, and reproduction patterns, such as the duration of its life cycle, the timing of its growth stages, and the nature of its survival strategies, ultimately

thrive in a particular environment and interact with its native species, thereby shaping its impact on local ecosystems."], "annual": ["A type of organism that completes its life cycle within a specific, predictable timeframe, often within a single year, and does not persist beyond that point, allowing for a high degree of adaptability and rapid colonization in a given ecosystem.", "A plant that exhibits a fast-paced life cycle, often completing its growth and reproductive stages within a short period, typically within a year or less, leading to a characteristic pattern of rapid germination, growth, and dispersal.", "A type of plant that grows, completes its life cycle, and often dominates a given ecosystem within a relatively short period, with new generations emerging

multiplication, and sudden disappearance, often leaving behind a residual impact on its environment.", "A plant that completes its life cycle within a predetermined period, often within a year, and is typically characterized by a rapid growth and flowering pattern, often requiring specific environmental conditions that can alter the native ecosystem."], "life cycle": ["The characteristic duration and pattern of an organism's growth, development, and reproduction, often categorized by its ability to complete its life stages within a fixed period or repeat them indefinitely, which can influence
