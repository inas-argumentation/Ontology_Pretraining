colonization, often driven by environmental factors and human activities, and serving as a proxy for tracking the pace and extent of a species' range expansion.", "The dynamic boundary marking the leading edge of an invasive species' expansion into new areas, characterized by a rapid transition from a relatively stable or absent population to a more established and growing presence.", "The leading edge of a colonizing species' progression into new territory, marked by a distinct boundary beyond which the species is no longer native, and characterized by the dynamic interaction between
