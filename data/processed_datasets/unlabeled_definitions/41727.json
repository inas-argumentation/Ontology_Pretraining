struggling to survive in fragmented and degraded habitats despite its adaptability to original ecosystems.", "A native amphibian species struggling to persist in a rapidly changing environment, with habitat fragmentation and degradation posing significant threats to its survival and reproductive success.", "A small, native amphibian species that is heavily reliant on specific environmental

yet profound changes brought about by human activities, often thriving in altered environments while their native counterparts struggle to persist.", "A family of amphibians characterized by their adaptable ability to thrive in altered environments, often by exploiting disturbed habitats and exploiting ecological niches, and sometimes through the introduction of non-native individuals, which can outcompete native species for resources and space.", "A group of globally dispersed, aquatic-anuran species that thrive in transformed environments, characterized by their adaptability to altered habitats and propensity for ecological dominance.", "A family of amphibians that thrives in areas of habitat disruption, often finding suitable environments amidst human-altered landscapes and

reproduction of native, threatened populations.", "Pathways of altered terrain created by human activity, disrupting natural hydrological flows and facilitating the spread of invasive species.", "Permanent or semi-permanent raised channels or pathways that traverse landscapes, facilitating human movement and potentially disrupting natural hydrological cycles, which in turn can have unintended

native biodiversity."], "habitat degradation": ["The process of altering or depleting the natural environment through human activities, resulting in a diminishment of the ecological integrity and quality of a region, often favoring certain species over others, such as invasive species that exploit these changes to expand their range and outcompete native ones.", "The process by which human activities, such as road-building and altered hydrology, disrupt the natural balance of a ecosystem's water flow and substrate, leading to a decline in its overall quality and suitability for the native species that call it home, while simultaneously creating an environment that is more conducive to the spread and survival of non-native species.", "The cumulative impact of human activities on natural environments, resulting in a decline of essential resources and conditions that support the survival and well-being of native species, often favoring invasive competitors and leading to the
