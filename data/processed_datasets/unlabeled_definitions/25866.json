phases of a region's flora.", "A graphical representation of the accumulation of specimen records over time, tracing the distribution of introduced and native species in a given territory, allowing for the identification of periods of rapid expansion and potentially correlated environmental or socioeconomic changes.", "A visual representation of the accumulation of species records over time, reflecting the distribution and spread of non-native species in a region, with increments in the proportion of introduced species suggesting expansions in population size or geographic range."], "invasion periods": ["The time intervals during which a specific biological component, introduced to a new environment, rapidly increases its geographic range and population size, often in response to changes in land use, agriculture, or other environmental factors.", "The time span during which non-native plant species rapidly spread across a region, often in tandem with significant changes in local agricultural practices and infrastructure, leading to a notable expansion of their geographical distribution.", "The periods of accelerated expansion and proliferation of non-native plant species in a territory, often driven by external factors such as changes in land use, agricultural practices, or trade, resulting in their widespread establishment and dominance.", "A succession of intervals marked by the rapid and widespread establishment of non-native plant species, often indicative of significant changes in land use patterns, technological advancements, and ecological dynamics, culminating in a rapid shift in the composition of a region's flora over a relatively short period.", "The distinct phases of rapid spread and subsequent stabilization of non-indigenous plant populations in a specific region, which are often linked to changes in land use, agricultural practices, or economic conditions."], "alien flora": ["Non-native plant species that have established populations in a specific region through human activity, with characteristics that can be tracked and visualized through the accumulation of specimen records in herbarium collections.", "Non-native plant species that have established themselves in a new territory, often resulting from human activity, and have displaced native species through expansion and colonization, thereby altering the local ecosystem's composition and biodiversity.", "Plant species that have been introduced and established in a new region, often as a result of human activity, and have the potential to outcompete native species for resources, altering the local ecosystem dynamics and biodiversity.", "Plants that have been introduced to a region from outside its natural range, often as a result of human activity, and have since established themselves in the local ecosystem, potentially outcompeting native species for resources.", "A collective term for non-native plant species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new geographic region, often as a result of human activity, and have established themselves in the wild, potentially altering the native ecosystem."], "chile": ["A landmass characterized by a strong agricultural legacy and rapid economic development, leading to a surge in plant species introduction and widespread territorial expansion, with notable exceptions in its northern and southern extremes.", "A landmass characterized by an agricultural sector that has undergone significant modernization, resulting in increased productivity and efficiency, but also facilitating the rapid expansion of non-native plant species across its territory.", "A landmass characterized by a rapid transformation from a largely pristine environment to a cultivated and industrialized territory, where human activity and agricultural practices have led to a widespread invasion of non-native plant species in a remarkably short period of time, with certain areas exhibiting exceptions to this trend.", "A territory known for its rich agricultural history, where the introduction of foreign flora has led to a significant expansion of alien plant species in just a century, with its geographical extremes appearing to defy this trend.", "A country with a rich agricultural heritage, whose fertile lands have been extensively cultivated over the years, giving rise to a complex mosaic of introduced and native plant species, with the northern and southern regions exhibiting unique characteristics and resisting the rapid spread of non-indigenous flora."], "herbarium records": ["Collections of preserved plant specimens, including notes on their collection locations, dates, and characteristics, which provide a historical record of plant distribution and abundance, and can be used to study the spread of non-native species over time and track changes in ecological patterns.", "A repository of plant specimens, meticulously collected and preserved over time, which serves as a chronological archive of species presence, providing insight into the patterns and dynamics of their distribution and abundance in a given region.", "A systematic collection of plant specimens, meticulously preserved and documented, which serves as a historical record of a region's botanical evolution, allowing for the analysis of patterns and trends
