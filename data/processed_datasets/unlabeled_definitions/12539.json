structure, is able to rapidly spread and establish itself, often in association with early successional niches.", "The early stage of forest development characterized by the presence of a species that outcompetes native vegetation, leading to a decrease in arboreal diversity and community structure, and often marked by a lack of spatial homogeneity in its invasion pattern.", "A stage of ecological succession where a non-native plant species dominates an early successional community, characterized by a lack of structural complexity and reduced diversity of tree species, often accompanied by the

specific niches or ecological conditions within an ecosystem, often serving as an indicator of the overall health or developmental stage of the community.", "A type of species that plays a crucial

non-native organisms that exploit existing community structures and create a new spatial distribution of resources, ultimately shaping the composition and succession of the affected area.", "The

devastating consequences for its biodiversity and functionality.", "The uncontrolled expansion of a non-native plant species into an ecosystem, disrupting its natural balance and structure, often driven by the species' adaptability to exploit existing ecological gaps and outcompete native species for resources.", "The biological colonization of an ecosystem by a non-native species that alters the native vegetation structure and reduces biodiversity, often dominating or displacing native species and disrupting the community's natural ecological processes, which can occur at various stages of succession and is influenced by the ecological characteristics of the resident community.", "The displacement or replacement of native vegetation by a non-native species, resulting in a significant
