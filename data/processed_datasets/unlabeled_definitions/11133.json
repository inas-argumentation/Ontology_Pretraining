{"multiple paternity": ["The phenomenon where a female reproductive individual fertilizes her eggs with sperm from multiple males, resulting in a brood with genetic diversity derived from multiple paternal sources, potentially increasing the effective population size and enhancing the transmission of genetic variation to subsequent generations.", "A reproductive phenomenon where an individual female gives birth to offspring sired by multiple males, resulting in increased genetic diversity within a population and potentially contributing to the species' invasive success.", "The phenomenon where a female's reproductive output is contributed to by multiple males, allowing for a greater variety of genetic traits to be passed on to subsequent generations.", "The phenomenon where a female's offspring result from the genetic contributions of multiple males, promoting increased genetic diversity within a population and potentially enhancing the species' ability to thrive in new environments.", "The phenomenon where an individual, typically a female, has the capacity to produce multiple offspring with different genetic contributors, leading to increased genetic diversity within a population, and potentially facilitating the long-term persistence and adaptability of invasive species."], "reproductive tactics": ["The strategies employed by an organism to optimize its reproductive success, regardless of size or age, through a lack of discrimination towards potential mates, allowing for the possibility of multiple fertilizations and genetic contributions.", "The reproductive strategy employed by a species, where mature individuals have an equal opportunity to contribute to the genetic diversity of subsequent generations, regardless of their age, size, or dominant status.", "The range of mating strategies employed by individuals in a species, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in their reproductive efforts, as exemplified by the phenomenon of various males contributing to the production of offspring in a single reproductive event.", "The ability of a species to disregard traditional size and age hierarchies during mating, allowing for a potentially more diverse and adaptable gene pool by allowing any mature individual to participate in reproduction.", "The behavioral and physiological strategies employed by a species to maximize genetic diversity and ensure the successful transmission of its genes to subsequent generations, often involving flexible and adaptable reproductive habits that enable individuals to compensate for varying environmental conditions and reproductive opportunities."], "mosquitofish (gambusia holbrookii)": ["A small, prolific freshwater fish species known for its remarkable ability to thrive in a wide range of environments, capable of producing multiple broods with varying numbers of parents, thereby promoting genetic diversity and adaptation to its new surroundings.", "A highly adaptable and prolific aquatic species capable of reproducing with multiple mates, contributing to genetic diversity and invasive success through its remarkable capacity for multiple paternity and breeding opportunities.", "A highly reproductive and adaptable aquatic species, characterized by its ability to form successful mating unions with multiple partners, resulting in genetically diverse offspring that can thrive in a wide range of environments.", "A small, prolific fish that has mastered the art of reproductive adaptability, capable of producing large broods and mixing genetic material from multiple partners to ensure the survival and diversity of its populations in various aquatic environments.", "A small, prolific fish that has mastered the art of reproduction, thriving in a variety of environments by engaging in multiple matings and producing large broods, which contributes to its ability to maintain genetic diversity and thrive as an invasive species."], "reproductive skew": ["The uneven distribution of genetic contributions among individuals within a group, often resulting in a few dominant players making a disproportionate impact on the group's gene pool, leading to a loss of genetic diversity unless counteracted by mechanisms that promote mixing and mixing of genetic information.", "The extent to which reproductive success is concentrated among a subset of individuals, rather than being evenly distributed among a population, thereby contributing to the preservation of genetic diversity in subsequent generations.", "The phenomenon by which a few prominent individuals within a population dominate the reproductive process, resulting in a disproportional allocation of genetic material to their offspring, thereby maintaining the overall genetic diversity of the population.", "The distribution of genetic contributions among the males in a group of females, such that a few dominant males disproportionately siring a larger proportion of offspring, resulting in a departure from an even allocation of reproductive opportunities among males.", "The uneven distribution of genetic contributions to offspring within a reproductive group, often resulting in a small number of individuals making disproportionately large contributions to the next generation."], "effective population size": ["The number of genetically unique individuals that contribute to the propagation of a species' genetic diversity over multiple generations, considering the complex interactions between individual reproductive success, mating patterns, and the transmission of genetic information.", "The number of individuals that a population's genetic diversity is able to effectively adapt to and persist through, often influenced by the reproductive strategies of individuals within that population, such as the frequency of multiple mating and subsequent brood sizes, which can increase the potential for genetic diversity to be transmitted to subsequent generations.", "The measure of an invasive species' ability to perpetuate genetic variation in its populations, reflecting the complex interplay between the number of reproductive individuals, the frequency of multiple paternity, and the reproductive output of individuals, which together contribute to the species' capacity for adaptation and resilience in novel environments.", "The number of individuals within a population that contribute to the genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of the group, considering the factors that influence the flow and exchange of genetic information, such as mating habits, brood sizes, and reproductive success.", "The number of individuals that contribute to the passing on of genetic information to the next generation, taking into account the dynamics of mate choice and reproductive success, such as the number of mates and brood size, to reflect the actual evolutionary potential of a population."]}
