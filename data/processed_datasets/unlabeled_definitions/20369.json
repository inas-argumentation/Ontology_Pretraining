area to another, resulting in the alteration of its distribution and potential range expansion.", "A change in the environmental conditions within a species' occupied range, resulting in a mismatch between the historical habitat requirements of the species and its current distribution, often indicating a response to altered climatic conditions.", "A fundamental change in the environmental conditions tolerated by a species as a result of geographic range expansion, marked by the absence of overlap in climate conditions between the species' original and introduced habitats, ultimately affecting its ability to survive and thrive."], "environmental niche models": ["A framework that reconstructs the historical range and ecological preferences of a species within a geographic area, by
