often overshadowing its less conspicuous yet ecologically important native counterparts in its foraging habits and resource utilization."], "habitat fragmentation": ["The break-up and degradation of an ecosystem's natural boundaries and connectivity, resulting in isolated patches of native vegetation and disrupting the complex relationships between native species, such as pollinators, and the plants that rely on them for survival.", "A geographical landscape characterized by isolated patches of ecologically suitable areas, surrounded by vast expanses of inhospitable or alien environments, leading to disruptions in the natural coexistence and interactions between plant and pollinator species, which can have cascading effects on the ecosystem's biodiversity and functionality.", "The division of a ecosystem's plant communities into small, isolated patches, resulting in altered spatial patterns of resource distribution, which can affect the behavior and resource use of pollinators and other species.", "The separation of a once-contiguous ecological environment into smaller, isolated areas, resulting in reduced connectivity and fragmentation of plant-pollinator interactions, ultimately affecting the diversity and resilience of local species communities.", "The disconnection and fragmentation of ecological spaces, resulting in the isolation of plant and animal populations, leading to altered interactions and dependencies between species, and potentially compromising the functioning and resilience of entire ecosystems."], "cytisus scoparius": ["A thorny, non-native shrub that can outcompete native flora, whose impact on local ecosystems is often mitigated by the adaptability of certain pollinator species.", "A plant species that can thrive in invaded ecosystems, often displacing native vegetation and potentially altering local pollinator communities, which can have significant consequences for the native biodiversity of oak-savannah ecosystems.", "A thorny, non-native legume with a tendency to dominate local vegetation, altering the composition of native pollination networks and potentially outcompeting native plant species for resources.", "A type of invasive weed that can alter the floral resource landscape, potentially affecting the pollination patterns and population dynamics of native bumble bees and other pollinators.", "A prickly yet
