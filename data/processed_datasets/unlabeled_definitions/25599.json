{"species-specific risk assessment": ["A systematic evaluation of potential threats posed by the introduction of a limited set of harmful organisms to a specific ecosystem or geographic region, typically conducted when the ecosystem is not isolated and natural genetic exchange occurs.", "The process of evaluating the likelihood of introducing a specific subset of potentially invasive species, often within a defined geographical area, by assessing the similarity in environmental conditions and ecological pathways between the region where the species is native and where the water being transported has originated from, with the goal of prioritizing management efforts for high-risk introductions.", "A comprehensive evaluation process that focuses on a limited set of harmful organisms for specific voyage routes within a designated geographic area, aiming to identify potential risks of species introduction while considering the natural genetic exchange patterns within that region.", "A method of evaluating the likelihood of invasive species transfer, focusing on specific and typically well-known organisms, particularly in regions where genetic exchange is already prevalent, and relying on the assessment of a narrow set of criteria to determine the potential risk.", "A targeted evaluation of the likelihood of introducing a specific set of harmful organisms, typically with a narrow ecological niche, during a voyage within a well-defined regional ecosystem, where natural genetic exchange already occurs, and the impact of ballast water on these organisms can be contained."], "ballast water": ["The watery cargo that marine vessels take on during their journeys to maintain stability and balance, often carrying unintended living organisms that can potentially alter the genetic makeup of ecosystems they enter.", "Water carried by a vessel to maintain stability and balance during its journey, with the potential to transport non-native species that may disrupt the ecosystem in the region where the water is discharged.", "The liquid or solid matter carried in the hull of a vessel to maintain stability and balance during sea travel, which can potentially transport non-native species to new ecosystems, posing a risk to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.", "The liquid or gaseous substance carried in the hull of a vessel to offset its buoyancy and stability, which has the potential to alter the natural composition of marine ecosystems by inadvertently transporting organisms from one geographic location to another.", "Water carried in the tanks of a vessel to stabilize its buoyancy and balance, often introduced into non-native ecosystems and potentially harboring non-native species that can disrupt local biodiversity and ecological balance."], "bioregions": ["A region of the ocean characterized by a unique combination of environmental variables that shape the genetic diversity of its native species, where the exchange of genetic material through natural means, such as ocean currents, is generally limited to a specific subset of species.", "Areas of the world's oceans characterized by distinct ecological conditions, where genetic exchange between species is facilitated by shared environmental factors, such as temperature and salinity, and where ballast water risk assessments can be focused on specific sets of harmful species or general environmental conditions.", "Geographic areas characterized by unique combinations of environmental conditions, such as temperature and salinity, that influence the natural genetic exchange of species, with boundaries that may vary in scale depending on the context of biological conservation or environmental management.", "Geographic areas defined by the natural exchange of genetic material between species, often characterized by similar environmental conditions such as temperature and salinity, where the movement of organisms, including those transported through ballast water, can lead to relatively predictable interactions with native species.", "A defined geographic area characterized by distinct ecological and environmental conditions, often with limited natural genetic exchange between adjacent regions, and where the introduction of non-native species can have significant ecological implications."], "environmental similarity": ["The process of evaluating the likelihood of species introduction by comparing the inherent ecological characteristics of a journey's origin and destination points, such as temperature, salinity, and biotic composition, to determine whether the ballast water could potentially transport species between areas with limited or no natural genetic exchange.", "The measure of compatibility between the ecological conditions of two distinct regions, typically determined by shared fundamental characteristics such as temperature and salinity, to gauge the likelihood of species establishment and subsequent potential harm.", "The extent to which two ecosystems are likely to have analogous physical and chemical properties, potentially facilitating the transfer of species between them without significantly altering their native populations or ecosystems.", "The quality of matching fundamental characteristics, such as temperature and salinity, between two marine environments, allowing for the estimation of the likelihood of non-indigenous species successfully adapting and thriving in a new ecosystem.", "The condition in which the combination of natural environmental factors, such as temperature and salinity, that occur in two locations is relatively consistent, suggesting a limited exchange of species between these locations and a reduced risk of unwanted species introductions through ballast water exchange."], "environmental match": ["The degree of similarity between the conditions that exist in the water bodies at the start and end of a ballast water transport journey, such that the potential for introduction of non-native species is minimised.", "The process of identifying regions where the ecological conditions, such as temperature and salinity, are sufficiently comparable to those of another region to potentially facilitate the transfer of aquatic species without posing a significant risk of ecological disruption, thus enabling informed management decisions regarding ballast water exchanges.", "The process of evaluating the compatibility between an organism's ecological niche and the environmental conditions of its potential new location, taking into account the limited degree of genetic exchange between non-contiguous bioregions, and relying on fundamental variables such as temperature and salinity.", "The process of evaluating the degree of
