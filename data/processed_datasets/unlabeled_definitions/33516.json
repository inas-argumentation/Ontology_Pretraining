of the training data, while considering the characteristics of the species, its environment, and the modeling approach used.", "The capacity of a predictive model to accurately forecast the spatial distribution of a biological invader in novel areas, despite being trained on data from its native range, while taking into account the unique characteristics of the invader, its environment, and the

account the inherent differences between the original data and the new location, and the characteristics of the species, environment, and modeling approach used.", "The ability of a predictive model to accurately generalize its predictive power across different geographic areas, climates, or environmental conditions, while accounting for the unique characteristics and interactions of the species being modeled, the ecological context, and the modeling approach employed.", "The extent to which a predictive model can be reliably applied to forecast the distribution of a species in a new geographic area, without compromising its accuracy, despite the lack of direct ecological and environmental correlations between the native and introduced ranges."], "geographic range": ["The zone within which a species' ecological niches are consistently occupied and from which it is typically found, encompassing both its historical habitat and potential areas of dispersal.", "The geographical expanse within which a species has been observed or documented, encompassing its native and non-native territories, and serving as a benchmark for assessing the reliability of predictive models that attempt to explain and forecast its distribution.", "The extent of a species' presence or distribution over a region, which encompasses the specific territories or areas where it is naturally found, established, or has been introduced, often marked by geographical boundaries, environmental conditions, or climatic zones.", "The area of overlap between the historical habitat of a species and its actual or potential new location, often subject to variation and uncertainty due to factors such as climate change, human activity, and natural disturbance.", "The area where a species can be found and observed, including both its historical and current distribution, encompassing the distinct regions or habitats where it coexists with other species and interacts with its environment."], "model transferability": ["The ability of a statistical representation of an organism's geographic distribution to reliably apply to new and unfamiliar environments, unaffected by the biases of its original data source, and resilient to changing climatic conditions.", "The capacity of predictions made from species distribution data to remain reliable when applied to new geographic locations or environmental conditions, unaffected by the distance or context of the data's original collection.", "The extent to which a predictive framework developed for a specific environmental context can be reliably applied to new and distinct geographic areas or future climate scenarios, while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy in its predictions.", "The ability of a predictive tool to accurately replicate its predictions across different spatial areas and environmental contexts, while accounting for the characteristics of the invasive species, its native and introduced ranges, and the modeling approaches used.", "The capacity of a predictive framework to effectively extrapolate and generalize its predictions to novel geographic areas and environmental conditions, while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy and reliability, without significant modifications or recalibration."], "global synthesis": ["A comprehensive and systematic integration of diverse data and findings across multiple spatial and temporal scales, allowing for the identification of patterns and relationships that may not be apparent at a local level, and enabling the formulation of general principles and insights that can inform decisions and management strategies for complex systems.", "A systematic and comprehensive analysis that brings together disparate pieces of evidence from various sources to provide a unified and far-reaching understanding of a phenomenon, allowing for the identification of patterns and trends that might not be apparent through isolated examinations.", "A comprehensive, quantitative examination of a widespread phenomenon that distills the collective understanding of a large number of independent observations into a unified framework, revealing complex patterns and associations that inform the management and prediction of ecological processes at a global scale.", "A comprehensive analysis that gathers and integrates data from multiple studies, spanning diverse geographic locations and scenarios, to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends across vast scales, thereby providing a broad and detailed understanding of a particular phenomenon.", "A comprehensive analysis that merges multiple data sources and perspectives to create a unified understanding of a phenomenon, revealing the complex relationships and patterns that underlie its behavior across diverse contexts and scales."]}
