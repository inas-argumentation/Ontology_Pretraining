establishing or succeeding through the direct manipulation of resources, space, or environmental conditions, thereby impeding the invasive species' ability to thrive.", "The inability of invasive species to thrive in an ecosystem due to the pre-existing presence of native species, which effectively occupy and utilize limited resources, thereby limiting the opportunities for the invasive species to establish and grow.", "The process by which native species in an ecosystem exert pressures on invading species through resource competition, potentially limiting their establishment and success, but may not necessarily involve consumption or predation.", "The phenomenon by which native species within a community prevent invasive species from establishing and thriving by utilizing similar resources, such as space, light, or nutrients, thereby restricting their growth and success.", "The inhibitory effect on invasive species that occurs when native communities within an

hydrosphere that is characterized by a relatively constant or seasonal flow of water, encompassing areas where native flora and fauna interact with invading species in a complex web of competitive and

and a reliance on consumption-based interactions to resist the establishment and persistence of invasive species.", "Areas where life-giving waters from terrestrial sources, such as rainfall or groundwater, converge with communities that are adapted to thriving in environments where aquatic plants and animals coexist in a delicate balance, often characterized by slower water flow and stable temperatures, thereby creating ecosystems that are susceptible to invasion by non-native species."], "trophic level": ["The position or role within an ecological food chain where a species obtains energy by consuming other organisms, with the potential to exert top-down control and influence the population dynamics of invasive species.", "The sequential layers of a community's food web, where each level relies on consumption and predation to regulate the population dynamics of primary producers and consumers, ultimately shaping the establishment and performance of non-native species in a given ecosystem.", "The hierarchical organization of organisms in a community, where some species feed on others, resulting in a complex web of interactions that shape the dynamics of native and invasive populations, ultimately influencing the fate of ecological processes and ecosystem function.", "The hierarchical layering of aquatic communities, where each level represents the food chain's sequence of energy transfer from primary producers to higher-order consumers, with native species playing a crucial role in shaping the ecological pathway and limiting the establishment of invaders
