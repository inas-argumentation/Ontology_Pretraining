surprisingly low levels of aggression towards non-nestmates despite high levels of chemical similarity and geographic dispersal."], "cuticular hydrocarbans": ["Chemical signals present on the surface of insects' exoskeletons, playing a crucial role in colony recognition and potentially shaping the dynamics of social interactions within and between colonies, as evident in the case of invasive ant species where their global dispersal has led to the emergence of genetically distinct populations with surprisingly low levels of intraspecific aggression.", "A type of subtle chemical signal embedded in the outer layer of an insect's body, allowing them to recognize and distinguish between individuals of the same colony, and potentially playing a key role in shaping the social structure and geographic range of certain invasive species.", "Chemical compounds found on the surface of insects that serve as a unique identifier, allowing individuals to recognize and differentiate between members of their own colony and those from other colonies, much like a fingerprint identifies an individual human.", "Small molecules secreted by ants and detected on their body surface, serving as a vital component in their ability to distinguish between individuals from the same or different colonies, and potentially influencing the formation of supercolonies in invasive species.", "A unique blend of chemical signatures on the outer surface of insects, which serves as a key identifier, allowing individuals from the same colony to recognize one another and distinguish themselves from outsiders, playing a crucial role in maintaining social cohesion and determining membership within the colony."], "aggression": ["The propensity for individuals to engage in competitive behaviors, often accompanied by displays of dominance or threat, which can manifest in various forms, including physical interactions, chemical signals, or spatial dynamics, and are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.", "A form of behavior characterized by intense confrontation, hostility, or opposition between individuals or groups, often motivated by perceived threats or differences in identity, and frequently accompanied by chemical cues and energetic displays.", "The phenomenon where ants from different colonies exhibit a heightened level of antagonism, characterized by an increase in competitive behavior, physical interactions, and chemical defense mechanisms.", "The behavioral expression of conflict or competition between individuals, characterized by a persistent and intense interaction, often involving physical contact, pheromone release, or other forms of direct or indirect confrontation, ultimately serving to establish and maintain social hierarchies or boundaries within a social group or colony.", "The expression of hostility or antagonistic behavior towards a member of the same species, characterized by a tendency to resist or dominate others through physical or chemical interactions, often regulated by subtle cues that allow for differentiation between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics."], "genetic differentiation": ["The degree to which separate groups or colonies of an organism show distinct variations in their genetic makeup, which can result in differences in physical characteristics, behavior, or survival traits, even when they originated from a common ancestor.", "The process by which distinct groups within a species develop unique characteristics, often as a result of geographical isolation or other environmental factors, which can lead to the formation of distinct lineages or populations.", "The extent to which distinct subpopulations of a species have developed unique biological characteristics, such as chemical signatures, as a result of their geographic isolation and independent evolution, often reflected in a low degree of genetic similarity between these subpopulations.", "The degree to which distinct populations or colonies of a species have developed unique chemical signatures, physical characteristics, or reproductive isolation over time, resulting in reduced gene flow and increased genetic distinctness between them.", "The degree to which populations or colonies of a species have evolved distinct characteristics, including chemical profiles and behaviors, due to prolonged separation and independent selection pressures, often resulting in a significant lack of genetic similarity between individuals from different populations."], "invasion biology": ["The study of the
