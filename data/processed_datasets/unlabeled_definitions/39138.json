{"compensatory predation": ["The phenomenon where the reduction or removal of a dominant predator species in an ecosystem is offset by an increase or intensified predation pressure from other predator species, potentially maintaining or even exacerbating the overall predation burden on the targeted species or ecosystem.", "When the elimination or reduction of a key predator in a food chain results in an unexpected and proportional increase in predation pressure from other predators, often due to a balance of predator populations being disrupted.", "When the elimination or reduction of one species responsible for predation leads to an offsetting increase in predation by other species, thereby offsetting the expected reduction in predation, thereby rendering the effort to control predation ineffective.", "When the removal of one predator species from an ecosystem does not lead to a direct proportional decrease in predation pressure on its prey, instead, other predator species may fill the ecological niche and maintain or even increase the overall predation rate, potentially offsetting the intended benefits of the predator's removal.", "When the removal of a dominant or overabundant predator species from an ecosystem does not necessarily lead to a significant reduction in predation pressure on a specific prey population, as other predator species may adapt to fill the vacant ecological niche, maintaining the overall predation rate."], "manorina melanocephal": ["A species of bird notorious for its aggressive behavior and tendency to disrupt the breeding habits

create a vacuum for other opportunistic actors to fill, ultimately requiring a nuanced and adaptive approach to achieve long-term ecological benefits.", "The deliberate alteration of the dynamics of a natural system with the goal of enhancing the sustainability and resilience of the entire ecosystem, while acknowledging the potential for unforeseen consequences and the need for ongoing monitoring

surprisingly, its removal may not lead to a corresponding decrease in the overall nest predation rates due to the presence of other opportunistic predators.", "A particular bird species known for its
