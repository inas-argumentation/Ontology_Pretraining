{"phylogenetic constraints": ["The tendency for organisms from a shared evolutionary history to exhibit limited morphological or physiological diversity, leading to constraints on the range of life forms that can occupy a given environment, even in the absence of obvious physical or environmental barriers.", "The limitations imposed on a biological community's ability to adapt and thrive by the inherent traits and characteristics of the species that make up that community, which can be influenced by the physical environment and historical evolutionary processes.", "The inherent biological biases and limitations inherent within a community's native plant species, which can influence the potential for invasion by novel life forms, thereby shaping the community's ecological structure and diversity.", "The limitations on the evolutionary adaptations of native plant species to their environment, stemming from their shared evolutionary history and resulting in restricted possibilities for growth forms and habitats, thereby influencing the likelihood of invasion by novel life forms.", "The cumulative evolutionary legacy of a community's botanical history, shaping its ability to absorb or adapt to novel forms of life that can thrive in its ecological niches, thus influencing the likelihood of successful invasions by extraneous plant species."], "raunkiaer": ["The underlying structure of plant communities that reveals the dominant influence of physical environment on plant evolution and adaptation, often masked by the limitations imposed by phylogenetic relationships among native species.", "The underlying principle that governs the distribution of vegetation structures across diverse ecosystems, highlighting the dominance of physical environmental factors in shaping the composition and diversity of plant communities.", "The concept that emphasizes the significant impact of environmental factors on the distribution and diversity of plant life forms, highlighting the importance of physical conditions in shaping the characteristic structures and habits of plant species.", "The concept that the physical environment exerts a profound influence on the evolution and adaptation of plant life forms, revealing the underlying strengths of natural selection in shaping the characteristics of a community.", "The underlying mechanism that governs the distribution of plant forms within ecosystems, influenced by physical environments, and can be both constrained and liberated by the presence of non-native species."], "life form spectra": ["The characteristic arrangement of plant community architectures, determined by the presence or absence of specific growth forms, habits, and phenological patterns, which reflect the interplay between environmental pressures and the evolutionary history of the native flora.", "The unique combination of physical characteristics and growth habits displayed by a community of plants, which is shaped by both the physical environment and the evolutionary history of the plant species present, resulting in a distinct pattern of structural and functional diversity.", "The collective pattern of plant
