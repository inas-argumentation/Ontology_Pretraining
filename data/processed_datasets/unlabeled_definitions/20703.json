consequences that can impact the native species and their habitats."], "orconectes": ["A crustacean species that has the unique ability to both foster and hinder the spread of aquatic vegetation,

influencing their interactions, which can either facilitate or hinder their coexistence.", "The process by which aquatic species selectively occupy and utilize specific zones within a waterbody, often driven by environmental factors that favor the growth, survival, and reproduction of the individual species, which may lead to the coexistence or exclusion of other species from similar ecological niches.", "The selection of specific micro-ecological niches by a species, whereby it prioritizes certain areas within a larger environment that better suit its survival, growth, and reproduction,

competition and minimizing unfavorable conditions, often resulting in distinct spatial distributions.", "The process by which a species or group of species adapts to and occupies specific environments
