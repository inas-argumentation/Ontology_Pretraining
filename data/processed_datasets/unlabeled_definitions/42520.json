near-coastal regions, with its feeding habits having a disproportionate impact on certain native species that are already struggling to survive.", "A carnivorous mammal of southeastern Australia, renowned for its omnivorous diet and varied prey spectrum, often featuring as a vital ecological component in coastal and near-coastal landscapes, but with its feeding habits and habitat usage contrasting sharply with those of another similar predator in the same region.", "A carnivorous, omnivorous or herbivorous canine species complex consisting of various breeds, hybrids and populations, native to certain regions, having distinct dietary habits and preying on a range of mammals, with some being primary consumers of threatened native species.", "A distinctive subset of canine predators

dynamics of threatened terrestrial mammals."], "canids": ["A group of carnivorous mammals, often associated with coastal and near-coastal ecosystems, that comprise a diverse range of species, including some that are notorious for their impact on native faunas, with certain members having a predilection for larger prey items, while others specialize in preying upon smaller mammals.", "A family of carnivorous mammals characterized by their adaptability to diverse environments, omnivorous dietary habits, and propensity to hunt and predate upon a wide range of terrestrial vertebrates, including small to large species, with some species being more efficient predators of certain species than others.", "A group of carnivorous mammals characterized by their adaptability to diverse environments and diets, often playing a significant role in shaping the dynamics of their ecosystems, with some individuals exhibiting a preference for larger prey items, while others tend to focus on smaller species, ultimately influencing the conservation status of local wildlife.", "Large, carnivorous mammals that roam the landscape, their scavenging habits often leaving behind clues about their dietary preferences and potential impact on native species.", "A group of carnivorous mammals that often roam in packs, primarily inhabiting coastal and near-coastal areas, where they feed on a diverse range of prey items, from small rodents to larger marsupials, and play a significant role in shaping the ecosystem's food web."], "wild dog": ["A large, carnivorous canine species or hybrid of species that roam in southern Australian coastal and near-coastal areas, posing a potential threat to native terrestrial mammals and often consuming larger prey items like wallabies and wombats.", "A large, carnivorous mammal that roams free and is known to prey upon a variety of small to medium-sized animals, often exhibiting a complex relationship with native fauna in specific regional ecosystems.", "A feral canine with a propensity for occupying coastal and near-coastal regions, characterized by a varied diet comprising both small and large native mammals, often coexisting with other canid species in the southern regions of mainland Australia.", "A free-ranging, carnivorous predator that roams in coastal and near-coastal areas, known for its predilection towards larger prey items, such as wallabies and wombats, and occasionally consumes smaller mammals and native species, which may contribute to their decline.", "A medium-to-large sized canid, typically characterized by
