in the resilience and recovery of ecosystems."], "rhizome": ["A subterranean stem structure that enables a perennial grass to rapidly re-emerge and propagate itself, allowing it to maintain a stronghold in an ecosystem despite attempts at control, and which can be particularly adept at colonizing areas with established populations.", "A type of underground stem that serves as a strategic storage unit, allowing certain plants to regenerate from residual components even in the face of adversity, such as fire or herbicide treatment.", "Underground stems of certain grasses that play a crucial role in plant regeneration, allowing the species to spread and recolonize areas where above-ground growth is impeded or removed, as observed in the rapid recolonization of Reed canary grass in the study.", "The underground stem of a perennial grass that serves as a hub for vegetative growth, allowing it to rapidly colonize new areas and establish a strong presence in the ecosystem.", "The
