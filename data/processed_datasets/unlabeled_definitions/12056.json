sometimes inadvertently serving as a facilitator for the introduction of non-native species to a new region.", "A man-made structure constructed to protect a shore or harbour from the impact of waves, waves being a result of the wind-blown motion of water on the surface of the ocean, thereby creating a sheltered area for marine life to thrive and allowing for the accumulation of submerged boulders that can serve as a habitat for certain species of marine worms.", "A submerged structure designed to protect a harbor or coastline from the erosive effects of waves and tides, often providing a habitat for unique marine species that can thrive in its sheltered environment.", "A barrier constructed near a coastline to protect ships and marine life from the harsh effects of waves and currents, providing a haven for a diverse range of organisms to thrive."], "royapuram fishing harbour": ["A coastal site where marine species from distant regions can potentially be introduced through human activities, such as the arrival of ships carrying ballast water or fouling organisms on their hulls, which can then establish populations and impact local ecosystems.", "A coastal area where marine species are introduced and adapted, often through human activity, where a mix of native and non-native species coexist, and where the possibility of invasive species is present due to shipping and water trade.", "A popular coastal location known for its vibrant fishing industry, characterized by submerged structures and a unique marine ecosystem that has recently yielded a significant discovery of a non-native species.", "A coastal area where marine activities, such as fishing and boat mooring, converge, often featuring infrastructure like breakwaters and submerged structures that provide habitat for a diverse range of marine organisms.", "A bustling maritime hub where marine life and human activity converge, fostering unique interactions and exchanges between diverse species, including non-native invaders that can arrive via unexpected pathways."], "marine worm snail": ["A type of seafloor-dwelling gastropod with a slimy, worm-like body that inhabits rocky or artificial structures, often found in moderate waters and characterized by its propensity to hitchhike on vessels or other moving objects, leading to the colonization of new regions.", "A type of marine invertebrate characterized by its segmented body and snail-like shell, often found living in close association with submerged coastal structures and feeding on algae and other organic matter.", "A type of shell-bearing invertebrate that lives underwater, possessing a slender, worm-like body and a hard outer layer that protects it, often colonizing and thriving on underwater structures and surfaces.", "A marine invertebrate that is characterized by a slender, worm-like body covered in a hard, protective shell, typically inhabiting coastal areas and often found on submerged structures.", "A type of marine invertebrate that combines the characteristics of a worm's ability to move through sediment with the shell-forming capacity of a snail, typically found in intertidal and subtidal zones where it can colonize substrates like rocks and artificial structures."], "chennai": ["A major urban hub situated on the southeastern coast, renowned for its bustling ports and rich marine biodiversity, which serve as a gateway for exotic marine species to arrive from distant shores.", "A vibrant coastal metropolis famous for its bustling fishing harbors, where the intricate balance
