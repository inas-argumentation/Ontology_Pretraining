taxonomic controversy and complex geographic spread."], "caprella scaura scaura": ["A certain type of small, non-native crustacean that has been spreading rapidly across the Mediterranean region and northern Africa, having originated from a specific geographic location and exhibiting a consistent physical appearance, with some scientific debate surrounding its classification as a distinct

categorization as separate subspecies."], "caprella scauratypica": ["A non-native crustacean with a widespread and complex taxonomic history, originally described from a distant location and later reported in various forms across different regions, characterized by its ability to adapt and thrive in diverse marine environments.", "A small, widely dispersed crustacean species native to the

varieties that may actually represent a single form with variable morphological characteristics.", "A non-native crustacean species, originally described in a tropical region, whose range expansion has been complicated by taxonomic uncertainties, and is now widely distributed across southern Europe and northern Africa, exhibiting a consistent morphological form.", "A non-native crustacean species, native to distant tropical waters, that has quietly expanded its range across southern Europe and northern Africa, disguising its multiple aliases with identical morphological
