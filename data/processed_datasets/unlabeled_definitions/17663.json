new region through trade or other human activities, and have the potential to cause significant economic harm to the local agricultural industry by feeding on crops and damaging their quality."], "economic losses": ["The value of goods and services not produced or delivered due to the detrimental effects of invasive insect populations on agricultural products, resulting in financial harm to
