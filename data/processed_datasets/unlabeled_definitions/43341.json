{"global economic costs": ["The measurable fiscal burden resulting from the disruption of natural ecosystems and the consequential impairment of human activities, goods, and services, often caused by non-native species, which can be calculated through a comprehensive assessment of damage, loss, and management expenditures across various sectors, geographical regions, and time periods.", "The quantifiable monetary value of disruptions to human activities, sectors, and industries, resulting from the invasion of non-native species, which can cause resource depletion, damage to infrastructure, and altered ecosystem functions, ultimately leading to economic losses and burdens on society.", "The total monetary value of losses and damages incurred by a region or global community due to the invasive behavior of certain species, encompassing the loss of productivity, infrastructure, and ecological health, as well as the expenses associated with prevention, control, and eradication efforts.", "The total value of financial losses and damages incurred by human societies as a result of disruptions to natural systems and ecological processes, arising from the presence of non-native species that harm the environment, economy, and human well-being.", "The aggregate value of damage to natural and human-made resources, including losses to productivity, revenue, and environmental health, incurred by the global economy as a result of the invasive presence of non-native, terrestrial invertebrates, which compromises various primary economic sectors."], "invasive arthropods": ["Any unwanted and highly adaptable terrestrial organisms, often originating from other regions, that cause significant harm to ecosystems and economic sectors by directly damaging natural resources and infrastructure, leading to substantial financial losses and impeding conservation efforts.", "Small, often microscopic or tiny, non-native organisms that harmfully alter ecosystems and economies, causing devastating losses to primary industries such as forestry, agriculture, and human health.", "Species of terrestrial animals, often of non-native origin, that disperse widely and cause significant harm to the economy, ecology, and human health by damaging primary sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and health, resulting in substantial losses and disrupting ecosystem functions and services.", "A species of terrestrial, non-vertebrate, multi-legged organisms that, having been introduced to a region through human activity, cause significant ecological and economic disruptions by outcompeting native species for resources, altering ecosystem functions, and causing widespread damage to primary industries, agriculture, and human health, often resulting in substantial economic losses and requiring urgent management intervention.", "Organisms that, having been introduced to a region through human activity, spread rapidly and cause significant economic and ecological damage by altering ecosystems, degrading natural resources, and disrupting the functioning of ecosystems, often with profound long-term consequences."], "invasive terrestrial arthropods": ["Organisms that are non-native to a specific region or ecosystem, causing significant ecological and economic disruption by directly damaging primary economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and human health, and indirectly affecting ecosystem functions and services, ultimately requiring costly management interventions to mitigate their impacts.", "Non-native, unwanted, and highly adaptable invertebrates that disrupt ecosystems and primary economic sectors, causing significant economic losses and damages to resources, such as forests, agricultural lands, and human health.", "Species of tiny, six-legged critters that thrive in foreign lands, causing chaos in local ecosystems and draining national coffers, with a penchant for wreaking havoc on timber, fields, and even human health, and often requiring costly interventions to mitigate their destructive presence.", "Non-native, land-dwelling creatures that colonize and wreak havoc on native ecosystems, causing significant economic losses and disruptions to primary sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and health, with their presence requiring urgent management and control to mitigate the escalating costs and ecological impacts.", "Organisms that venture beyond their natural habitats and establish populations in new regions, causing significant harm to local ecosystems and economies by damaging primary sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and human health, with a substantial portion of these impacts attributed to the invasive insects."], "invasive termites": ["Organisms that, introduced by human activity or natural dispersal, wreak havoc on the global economy by inflicting significant damage and losses to primary sectors, such as forestry, agriculture, and health, with a disproportionate impact on North America, and exhibit a propensity to increase in economic burden over time.", "Species of terrestrial invertebrates that exhibit a tendency to overwhelm native ecosystems, infest agricultural and forestry resources, and wreak significant economic havoc, primarily through their ability to cause substantial direct resource damages and losses.", "A subset of tiny, six-legged creatures that wreak havoc on global economic sectors, such as forestry and agriculture, by exploiting vulnerable ecosystems and inflicting significant, yet often underreported, damage on resources and infrastructure, resulting in substantial financial burdens that have been mounting steadily over the past several decades.", "Species of terrestrial insects that migrate from their native habitat and wreak havoc on local ecosystems and economies by causing massive destruction to primary industries, such as agriculture and forestry, resulting in significant financial losses and disrupting global economic stability.", "Species of insects that have been introduced to an ecosystem beyond their native range, causing significant economic losses and damage to primary sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and public health, by consuming and destroying valuable resources and infrastructure."]}
