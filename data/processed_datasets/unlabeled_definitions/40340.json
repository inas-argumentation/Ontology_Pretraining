anthropogenic landscape feature characterized by intensive cultivation of a specific crop, often resulting in a dense, grassy monoculture with minimal tree cover, typically found in tropical regions where land-use change has significant impacts on local biodiversity, particularly with regards to ant communities.", "A type of cultivated landscape where intensive human activity has led to a unique ecological environment characterized by a lack of native plant diversity and a disproportionate presence of invasive species, often serving as a hub for the proliferation of non-native ants and other invasive organisms.", "A type of intensive agricultural land use characterized by a managed wetland environment, often used to cultivate crops that require specific microclimates, which can have a disproportionate impact on the local ant community, potentially leading to a loss of native diversity.", "A type of human-altered land use characterized by intensive agricultural practices, often resulting in the homogenization of local biodiversity, which has been linked to a decrease in native ant species richness, particularly those that are non-endemic."], "fallow": ["A type of temporary landscape feature characterized by the absence of intense cultivation, allowing native plant species to regrow and create a habitat for endemic ants, while also serving as a transition zone for exotic species to establish themselves.", "A period of land abandonment, where vegetation is allowed to regrow, resulting in a habitat that can support unique ecological communities, including ants, in a dynamic equilibrium with the agricultural landscape.", "The temporary abandonment of land that has been previously cultivated or disturbed, resulting in a transitional stage characterized by a mix of native vegetation and agricultural remnants, where ecosystem processes are reshaped by the interplay of local species and anthropogenic activities, and where biodiversity is influenced by the delicate balance between forest resilience and land-use legacies.", "Land that has been cleared of its natural vegetation, often temporarily, and is characterized by a mix of open spaces and remnants of trees or other vegetation, allowing for a gradual transition back to a forest ecosystem while hosting a unique set of ant species.", "A type of land use characterized by a deliberate abandonment of
