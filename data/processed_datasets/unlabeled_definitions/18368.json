tracking due to their ability to spread and adapt to various habitats.", "A group of carnivorous marine invertebrates, characterized by their remarkable adaptability to a wide range of aquatic environments, from shallow tidal flats to deep-sea sediments, and notorious for their voracious appetite and ability to secrete acidic substances to digest their prey.", "A group of carnivorous marine gastropods, characterized by their voracious appetites and ability to secrete acid, which have been introduced to non-native habitats through human activities, causing significant ecological disruption and altering native bivalve communities.", "Large, predatory marine gastropods characterized by their voracious appetites and ability to secrete acid, often invading new habitats and exploiting native bivalve populations.", "A group of marine gastropods, often exhibiting carnivorous behavior, characterized by their remarkable adaptability to various habitats, from shallow coastal waters to great depths, and notorious for their ability to establish themselves as dominant predators, with the potential to disrupt native ecosystems and have significant ecological impacts."], "16s": ["A short DNA sequence found in the mitochondria of many organisms, which serves as a molecular identifier, much like a unique signature that allows scientists to distinguish between closely related species, even when their physical characteristics are similar, and is often used to study the distribution and evolution of species.", "A genetic identifier used to uncover the hidden nature of underwater predators, revealing the mysteries of their past and present populations, and shedding light on the complex relationships between foreign invaders and native ecosystems.", "The genetic \"fingerprint\" of a species that can be used to uncover the evolutionary relationships between different organisms, providing a unique identifier that can help researchers track the movements and diversity of invasive species.", "A sequence of genetic code found in the energy-producing centers of cells, often used to identify and distinguish species, particularly in the case of marine invaders that thrive in diverse aquatic environments.", "A vital DNA sequence used to identify and distinguish species, much like a unique signature that unlocks the doors to understanding the origins and classification of organisms, even those that have spread across the globe as voracious predators."], "mitochondrial gene": ["The genetic instructions encoded within the energy-producing organelles of cells, responsible for the breakdown of nutrients and the production of energy for an organism, which can be used to identify and distinguish between different species of marine animals that have invaded coastal ecosystems.", "The genetic code carried within the powerhouses of a cell that holds the secrets to an organism's past and provides a unique fingerprint for identification purposes.", "A type of genetic material responsible for energizing cells, found within cells' powerhouses, and used to identify and distinguish between different species of ocean-dwelling predators that feed on bivalve mollusks and have a significant impact on the ecosystems they inhabit.", "The DNA found in the energy-producing powerhouses of cells that plays a crucial role in the transmission of inherited traits, much like the way invasive marine animals can introduce new characteristics to a ecosystem, ultimately reshaping its ecological balance.", "A specific type of genetic material located within the energy-producing centers of cells, essential for generating power for the organism, has been utilized in this study to identify and differentiate between various species of a particular group of marine animals."], "gastropod": ["A type of marine animal characterized by its soft, unsegmented body, typically with a radula (tooth-like structure) and a tendency to prey on other marine organisms, often using specialized secretions to subdue its victims.", "Marine animals that slide silently through the water, possessing a radula with razor-sharp teeth to devour their prey, and often exhibit cunning behaviors to avoid being eaten by their predators, exemplified by the invasive species that have adapted to thrive in various coastal ecosystems.", "A group of aquatic invertebrates characterized by a soft, unsegmented body, a flattened or spiral shell, and a penchant for exploiting vulnerable ecosystems through voracious predation and secreted acids, with some species able to adapt to a wide range of depths and habitats.", "A type of marine mollusk known for its voracious appetite and ability to secrete acidic compounds, often characterized by its remarkable adaptability to varied habitats and propensity to disperse rapidly across coastlines.", "A type of marine mollusk characterized by its slender, elongated body shape and ability to secrete corrosive substances to
