{"re-invasion": ["The process by which a species that was once dominant in a particular environment, only to decline or become extirpated, attempts to re-establish itself after a period of absence, often facing challenges and uncertainties in doing so.", "The process by which a species that has historically been dominant in a particular ecosystem, but has since declined or disappeared, makes a subsequent attempt to re-establish itself, often in response to changes in environmental conditions, but may be hindered by factors such as predation pressure, competition, or adaptation to its native habitat.", "The process by which a previously introduced or abundant species experiences a decline or disappearance from its new environment, only to re-emerge or re-establish itself in the same area, often due to factors such as changes in population dynamics, habitat modification, or predator-prey interactions.", "The re-establishment of a species in a community where it once thrived, but has since declined or disappeared, often requiring a significant event or alteration of the environment for it to re-colonize and potentially regain its dominant position.", "The process by which a species that was once dominant in a specific ecological community experiences a decline in its population over time, only to reappear in subsequent years, but ultimately fails to re-establish itself as a dominant species, potentially due to factors such as changes in environmental conditions, predation pressure, or competition from other species."], "predation pressure": ["The intensity of mortality caused by a community of feeding fish and other aquatic organisms, which can thwart the establishment of a non-native species by reducing its survival rate.", "The influence that certain members of a community have on the likelihood of survival and establishment of a particular species, often due to their feeding behavior.", "The cumulative effect of various biotic interactions that impede the successful establishment of a non-native species in an ecosystem, where the presence of established native predators creates a barrier to the spread and survival of the invasive species, particularly during its early stages of invasion.", "The intensity at which a dominant native species exploits and limits the presence of an introduced species, exerting a significant impact on its ability to establish and persist in its native habitat.", "The intensity of consumption of prey populations by a community of predators, resulting in a limiting factor that can hinder the establishment and success of invasive species."]}
