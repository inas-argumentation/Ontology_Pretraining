Lawrence River, where substrate characteristics, water chemistry variables, and current velocity play a crucial role in determining their relative abundance.", "The process by which organisms distribute themselves across an environment in response to various physical and chemical cues, resulting in a spatial partitioning of species that allows them to coexist despite competitive pressures, as seen in the phenomenon where native and exotic amphipods may choose different ecological niches in the same river, fostering a delicate balance of species presence and abundance.", "The process by which organisms opt for specific environments or microhabitats based on physical and chemical conditions that maximize their survival, growth, and reproduction, often resulting in segregation along ecological gradients and coexistence with other species.", "The process by which organisms adjust their spatial distribution within an environment to maximize their survival and reproduction, often in response to subtle differences in physical characteristics or chemical conditions, which can create distinct niches for coexisting species."], "amphipoda": ["Crustaceans that exhibit a unique ability
