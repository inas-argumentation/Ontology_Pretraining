balance between aquatic organisms, where one group may thrive under such conditions, while another group struggles to survive."], "displacement": ["The gradual replacement of a native organism's ecological role or distribution by a non-native species, resulting from the latter's superior ability to tolerate and exploit environmental stressors, such as low oxygen conditions.", "The process by which a species' dominant presence in an ecosystem is gradually replaced by that of another species, facilitated by differences in their tolerance to environmental stressors that limit the survival of the native species.", "The process by which one ecological entity gradually takes over the ecological niche and habitats previously occupied by another entity, often due to subtle but significant
