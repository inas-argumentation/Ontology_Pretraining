and habitats, and demonstrating remarkable adaptability and mobility, ultimately leading to a significant impact on the ecosystem's balance.", "A small, terrestrial crustacean that has migrated to a foreign environment and exhibits remarkable adaptability, rapid population growth, and a preference for specific substrates, often causing a significant decline in the native species' populations and disrupting the ecosystem balance.", "A non-native aquatic crustacean with a propensity for rapid colonization and expansion, often displacing native species and altering the ecosystem dynamics, particularly in shallow bodies of water, where its abundant populations can create insurmountable barriers to adult predators.", "A type of marine crustacean that has been introduced to a non-native habitat, where it rapidly establishes a large population and can potentially outcompete native species for food and resources, often exhibiting behaviors that allow it to thrive in specific environmental conditions.", "A small, mobile crustacean species that thrives in new habitats, often outcompeting native species for resources and space, and can adapt to a wide range of environments, exhibiting characteristics that enhance its ability to survive and multiply in a given ecosystem."], "fish food": ["The collective organic matter that serves as a sustenance source for certain aquatic animals, often featuring a dynamic balance between native and invasive species, and being shaped by factors such as substrate preference, depth distribution, and population mobility.", "Small aquatic

energy transmission, consisting of small, nutritious organisms that are readily consumed by larger predators, providing a crucial source of sustenance and nourishment in their natural habitats.", "Organisms that serve as a vital source of sustenance for certain aquatic species, providing a substantial portion of their dietary needs.", "The term refers to a type of underwater consumer whose biomass is significant enough to impact the structure and composition of a benthic community, and whose accessibility to larger aquatic animals is limited by environmental factors such as water depth, substrate type, and mobility."], "lake peipsi (lake peipus)": ["A shallow European lake characterized by a unique combination of aquatic species, where a dominant invasive species has disrupted the native benthic community, resulting in a distinct littoral zone with a high concentration of mobile, hard substrate-dwelling individuals, and where water level fluctuations have little impact on the survival of a specific aquatic population.", "A shallow, large freshwater body with a sandy shore, characterized by a delicate balance between native and invasive species, where a dominant invasive amphipod has successfully established itself, displacing native populations and altering the food web, and is now a primary food source for certain aquatic organisms.", "A vast, shallow body of fresh water featuring a distinct pattern of distribution and abundance of macrozoobenthos, where a dominant invasive species, preferring hard substrates and shallow beach areas, has a significant impact on the native fauna, resulting in local extinctions and ecological changes.", "A large, shallow water body characterized by a unique benthic community dynamics, where a dominant species, adapted to prefer hard substrates and thrive in areas with minimal water depth, has significantly impacted the native ecosystem, rendering its native inhabitants nearly extinct.", "A shallow body of freshwater that serves as a haven for invasive species, where its warm waters and gentle shores create a unique ecosystem where native species struggle to thrive, leaving a dominant invasive species to claim the majority of the benthic community as its own."], "shallow lake": ["A type of lake characterized by a shallow water depth, typically with a gradual transition from shallow to deeper waters, where vegetation and shore-dwelling organisms dominate, and where water level fluctuations have a significant impact on the aquatic ecosystem, making it susceptible to invasions by mobile species.", "A body of still or slow-moving water, typically ranging in depth from a few centimeters to a few meters, with a shoreline and substrate that is accessible to a wide range of aquatic organisms, but where the water is generally too shallow for adult fish to easily penetrate, allowing for the dominance of benthic invertebrates and other aquatic species that thrive in these environments.", "A body of water
