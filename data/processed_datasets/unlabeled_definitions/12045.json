insectivores."], "nestedness": ["The arrangement of ecological components, wherein the composition of a community or assemblage in a more disturbed or altered environment is comprised of a subset of the components found in a less disturbed or pristine setting, reflecting a pattern of loss or reduction in species richness and biodiversity.", "A phenomenon in which the composition of a complex system, such as a plant community, can be predicted by identifying a smaller, analogous subset within it, as if the larger system is \"boxed\" or contained within the smaller one, with the relationship between the two resembling a nested, hierarchical structure.", "The phenomenon where the composition of plant communities in areas with alien species invasions reflects a gradual filtering or culling of native species, leaving behind a subset of species that are able to coexist with the invasive species.", "The phenomenon where the plant species composition in a given ecosystem becomes increasingly similar to that of a nearby ecosystem as one moves from a more pristine to a more disturbed environment, resulting in a hierarchical structure of species relationships that reflects the influence of a dominant invasive species.", "The way in which a complex system, like a community of plants, is organized, where a subset of its components contains all the components of a smaller subset, resulting in a hierarchical and layered structure that reflects the relationships between its various parts."], "species turnover": ["The phenomenon where the assemblage of plant species in a ecosystem changes over time, resulting in a rearrangement of the ecological hierarchy, where some species replace others, leading to a reorganization of the community structure.", "The process by which the collective character of a native plant community is transformed as a dominant alien species alters the underlying species composition, often resulting in a reduction of native plant diversity and a rearrangement of the remaining species to create a simpler, more uniform assemblage.", "The gradual and significant shift in the composition of native plant communities in response to the invasive presence of a dominant species, marked by a loss of species richness, altered community structure, and the suppression of understorey vegetation.", "The transformation of a
