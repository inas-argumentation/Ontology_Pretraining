characteristics in its new environment."], "parasite introduction": ["The deliberate or unintentional transfer of an ectothermic, highly specific organism from its native habitat to a novel environment, often with its native host species, where it must adapt and persist in order to maintain a viable population.", "The process by which an alien species, often originating from a specific host species, is intentionally or unintentionally transported to a new geographic location, where it may establish a new population and potentially interact with local hosts, with varying degrees of success and compatibility.", "The intentional or unintentional transfer of a pathogen-like organism from its native environment to a non-native one, where it is likely to interact with a new host species, potentially altering the ecological dynamics of the recipient ecosystem.", "The intentional or unintentional transfer of a biological agent from its native environment to a new region, where it can establish a sustainable presence and potentially interact with new hosts, often with significant ecological and conservation implications.", "The process of transporting a previously unknown species from its native habitat to a new geographic location, often accompanied by its associated host, with the intention of establishing a self-sustaining population that can persist and potentially adapt to the new environment."], "parasite establishment": ["The successful colonization of a non-native area by a foreign entity, dependent on the establishment of a compatible and persistent relationship with the native host population, which requires a delicate balance between the presence of the entity on the host and its ability to thrive in the new environment.", "The successful integration of a foreign entity into a new ecosystem, where it is able to colonize and thrive in concert with its original host species, while demonstrating limited adaptability to alternative hosts and remaining resilient in the face of varying environmental conditions.", "The successful establishment of a pathogenic or symbiotic relationship between an introduced species and its host population in a new geographic area, requiring the presence of both individuals in the founder population and the ability of the host and the parasitic entity to persist and thrive in the new environment.", "The successful integration of a foreign species and its native counterpart into a new ecological setting, dependent on the persistence of both parties in the new area and the ability of the former to adapt to local conditions, as well as its ability to survive and propagate within the latter.", "The process by which a non-native species successfully colonizes a new environment, persists in the face of environmental and biological challenges, and forms a stable association with a local host population."], "host-switching": ["The phenomenon where a non-native parasite adapts to infect and survive on a different species of host, often outside its original range, potentially leading to establishment and transmission within a new ecological context.", "The ability of a parasite to form a successful attachment or colonization on a host species other than its typical or native host, often leading to a potential shift in its geographic range or ecological niche.", "The ability of a parasitic organism to successfully colonize and establish a viable population on a host species that is different from its native or intended host, often requiring a process of adaptation or modification to ensure survival and reproductive success.", "The phenomenon where a parasite, having successfully colonized a new area with its native host, begins to parasitize unrelated or different host species in that area, potentially adapting to these new hosts over time.", "The phenomenon where an invasive parasite or pathogen adapts to colonize and infect a new, non-native host species, potentially leading to ecological disruptions and altered host-parasite dynamics."], "gobiid fish": ["A type of fish, commonly found in certain rivers and freshwater systems of Europe and Asia, that exhibits a specific evolutionary history and is often parasitized by a particular species of ectoparasite, which has been introduced to new areas through human activity.", "A type of fish known for its close relationship with a particular genus of ectoparasites, characterized by a limited range of compatible hosts and a propensity to form exclusive associations with specific species of aquatic vertebrates.", "Freshwater fish native to the Ponto-Caspian region, characterized by their ability to co-occur with certain parasites that have been successfully introduced alongside them to other European river basins.", "Fish belonging to a group of species typically found in the Ponto-Caspian region, often serving as the native hosts for certain parasites, and exhibiting a strong ecological association with their respective parasitic species.", "A type of freshwater fish that is native to the Ponto-Caspian region and is commonly found in the Danube, Rhine, Scheldt, and Vistula river basins, characterized by its ability to co-evolve with a specific parasite and tolerate high infection levels, especially in areas distant from their native range."], "non-native range": ["The area where a species or parasite, once introduced from its natural range, has established a new territory and is present in a quantity that allows it to thrive, with the potential to interact with new host species and ecosystems.", "The geographic region outside of a species' original distribution area, where it has been introduced and established through human activity, often resulting in the potential for ecological interactions with local species.", "The area beyond the original ecological niche of a species, where it has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced and is now established outside its native territory, and where its presence can have significant impacts on the local ecosystem.", "The area outside the traditional ecological bounds where a species has originated and evolved, where its presence is attributed to human-mediated dispersal, and where its ability to colonize and persist is influenced by a complex interplay of biological and environmental factors.", "The geographical area where a species is introduced from its native habitat, where it co-evolved with its host, and where it can potentially adapt and persist in the new environment."], "monogenea": ["A group of microscopic, parasitic worms that specialize in attaching to specific host fish species, with some species demonstrating remarkable ability to adapt to new environments and co-occur with their hosts in distant locations, while others exhibit strong host specificity and struggle to survive on non-native hosts.", "A group of parasitic flatworms that typically attach to specific fish species and can spread through aquatic ecosystems by hitching a ride on their hosts, often playing a significant role in shaping the dynamics of their new environments.", "A group of parasitic flatworms that exhibit a strong association with a specific host species, often co-evolving with them in a specific region, but have also been known to adapt to new environments by introducing themselves alongside their native hosts, where they can then spread to other fish species under natural conditions.", "A type of parasitic worm that often relies on a specific host for its survival and reproduction, and is notorious for its ability to spread rapidly across different waterways, often with significant ecological consequences.", "A group of parasites that have adapted to a specific
