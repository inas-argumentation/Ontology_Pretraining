environmental changes, such as habitat fragmentation, climate shift, and invasive species.", "The dynamic and reciprocal adaptation of two species, one of which is a primary producer and the other a consumer, that results from the mutual interaction between them, shaped by the complex and changing interplay of environmental factors, including habitat modification, climate fluctuations, and the
