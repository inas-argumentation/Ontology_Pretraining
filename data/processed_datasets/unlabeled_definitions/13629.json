when at rest, likely diminishing the benefits of its bold nature.", "The physiological and metabolic expenses incurred by an organism as a result of its bold and adventurous nature, which can manifest as increased energy consumption when not actively foraging or engaged in other vital activities.", "The expenditure of additional vitality or stamina required to fuel the accelerated physiological processes and heightened activity levels exhibited by individuals at the leading edge of a species' expansion, likely offsetting some of the benefits derived from their bold and highly dispersible
