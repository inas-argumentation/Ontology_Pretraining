but also providing a means for natural predators to track and target it in the pursuit of effective biological control.", "A small, winged insect that forms distinctive abnormal growths, often protected by a hardened case, on the stems or leaves of specific plant species, where it lays its eggs and nourishes its larvae, often causing harm to the plant's health and reproductive potential.",

invasive pest, where the goal is for the natural enemy to establish itself and exert sustained control without ongoing human intervention.", "The intentional introduction and establishment of a
