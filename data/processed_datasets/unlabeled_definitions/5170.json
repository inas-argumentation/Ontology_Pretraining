{"invasion resistance": ["The capacity of a community to prevent or slow the establishment and spread of non-native species, particularly when these invaders outcompete native species for limited resources, with the resistance dependent on the dominant types of plants or vegetation present.", "The capacity of a community to resist the establishment and dominance of new, non-native species, thereby maintaining its ecological stability and diversity, regardless of changes in resource availability.", "The ability of a community to maintain its structural integrity and functional stability by preventing the overwhelming presence or dominance of a particular set of species, thereby preserving its overall ecological balance, particularly in the face of external perturbations such as changes in resource availability.", "The capacity of a community to suppress and filter out non-native species that attempt to establish themselves, thereby maintaining the integrity of its ecological structure and function.", "The ability of a community to maintain its composition and diversity by resisting the successful establishment of non-native species, particularly in situations where resources are limited and competition for these resources is intense."], "limiting similarity": ["The phenomenon where the coexistence of diverse individuals within a community is limited by the similarities in their traits and abilities, resulting in a \"filtering\" effect that shapes the composition of the community.", "The phenomenon where the relative abundance and characteristics of a particular community's dominant group exert a disproportionate influence on the success of similar invaders, shaping the overall composition of the community, whereas the success of individual invaders may exhibit varying responses to these community factors.", "The degree to which the characteristics of a dominant ecological entity, regardless of its type, influence the likelihood of invasion by similar entities, with the extent of this influence dependent on environmental conditions.", "The concept that suggests that the coexistence of multiple species within an ecosystem is influenced by the subtle differences in their traits and characteristics, which in turn shape the competition for resources and ultimately affect the likelihood of successful invasions.", "The phenomenon where the competitive interactions between coexisting species are influenced by the convergent adaptations that emerge from the similarities in their ecological niches, thereby shaping the distribution and abundance of species in a community."], "invasion success": ["The extent to which a non-native species is able to establish and thrive in a community dominated by a specific plant type, as influenced by the presence or absence of nutrient-rich conditions.", "The proportion of non-native plant species that successfully colonize and persist in a given community, ultimately altering its composition and functioning.", "The rate at which non-native species successfully establish and persist within an ecosystem, influenced by the composition and dominance of native functional groups and availability of limited resources, resulting in altered community structures and potential disruption of ecosystem processes.", "The extent to which non-native species manage to supplant and persist in a community dominated by a different type of plant or vegetation, potentially altering its composition and structure over time.", "The extent to which non-native species are able to successfully establish and proliferate within a previously dominated ecological community, driven by factors such as resource availability and the influence of dominant native functional groups."], "dominance": ["The state of having a prevailing influence or control over the ecological community, often shaped by the numerical or functional superiority of a particular species or group of species, which can alter the trajectory of community dynamics and resistance to invasion.", "The preponderance of a particular entity or characteristic within a community, having a disproportionate influence on the dynamics of invasion and coexistence among species, regardless of their individual traits.", "The dominant presence of a particular type of organism or characteristic in an ecosystem, which exerts a significant influence on the behavior and outcomes of other organisms or processes, particularly in situations where resources are limited or availability is variable.", "The most influential presence of a specific type of organism or group of organisms in a given environment, which can either maintain or disrupt the native community's structure and dynamics, ultimately affecting the likelihood of invasion by other species.", "The state of holding a disproportionate influence over the ecological dynamics of a community, where the characteristics of a particular entity determine the trajectory of its interactions with other entities."], "functional groups": ["A collective of plant species that share similar ecological roles and characteristics, functioning together in a community to shape its dynamics and response to environmental factors, often influencing the success or failure of other plant species attempting to invade.", "A set of coexisting species that share similar ecological roles, characteristics, or resource requirements, ultimately influencing the dynamics of an ecosystem, such as its resilience to invasion.", "A collection of plant species that, despite their individual differences, share similar ecological roles and characteristics, forming a distinct entity that can influence community dynamics and shape the success of invasive species in a given environment.", "In an ecological context, certain categories of organisms that thrive under similar conditions, sharing comparable characteristics that allow them to coexist and interact with their environment in distinct yet predictable ways, often exhibiting a level of dominance over their surroundings.", "A grouping of plant species based on their shared characteristics and ecological roles, such as growth habit, leaf structure, and flowering patterns, which influences their interactions and coexistence with one another and their ability to outcompete or coexist with invaders in different environmental conditions."]}
