invasive spread.", "The process of grouping individuals based on their shared genetic characteristics, revealing patterns of similarity and distinction among them, allowing researchers to infer origins, migrations, and dispersal patterns of a species, and uncovering the complex history of population dynamics and exchange.", "The process of grouping individuals or populations into distinct categories based on their shared genetic characteristics, allowing researchers to identify patterns and relationships between the samples, and ultimately, tracing the origins of invasive species across islands.", "A method for identifying patterns of genetic similarity among individuals by analyzing their unique DNA sequences, allowing researchers to group them into distinct populations or groups that share a common ancestry or geographic origin, and often revealing complex migration and transmission pathways between populations."], "herpestidae": ["A family of carnivorous mammals known for their agility and adaptability, often exhibiting invasive behavior across geographically isolated regions, as exemplified by their ability to spread across multiple Hawaiian islands despite efforts to control their population.", "A family of carnivorous mammals known for their remarkable adaptability and invasive tendencies, which have led to successful colonization of distant islands through various means of transportation.", "A family of carnivorous mammals that, when introduced to new islands, exhibit remarkable adaptability and ability to disperse across territories, often leaving behind genetic trails that reveal their origins and migration patterns.", "A family of carnivorous mammals that have adapted to inhabit islands, often through human-assisted means, and exhibit
