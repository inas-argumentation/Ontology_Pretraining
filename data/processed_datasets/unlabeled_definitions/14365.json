aggregations on hard substrates, altering local ecosystems by displacing native species and significantly impacting macrobenthic community structure.", "A specific type of invasive freshwater mollusk that, when introduced to new ecosystems, can dramatically alter the balance of native benthic communities, often resulting in a surge in diversity and biomass among native invertebrates, but also posing significant threats to specific native species, such as those that burrow or live in union-like structures.", "A type of invasive aquatic mollusk known for colonizing hard substrates in shallow water zones, where it can significantly alter the local ecosystem by increasing biodiversity and density of native invertebrates, while potentially disrupting the habitats of other native species, particularly those that rely on burrowing.", "A type of invasive freshwater mussel that forms dense aggregations on hard substrates, outcompeting native species and altering benthic community structures, with potential for significant ecological and economic impacts.", "A certain type of invasive bivalve that thrives on hard substrates in littoral zones, exhibits high population densities, and has a profound impact on the composition and diversity of native benthic communities, often leading to devastating consequences for certain native species."], "freshwater bivalves": ["Aquatic shell-bearing mollusks that inhabit non-saline environments, characterized by a wide range of ecological impacts, including alterations to substrate composition, shifts in community diversity, and potential threats to native species.", "Shell-forming aquatic organisms that thrive in non-marine environments, characterized by their filter-feeding habits and propensity to aggregate in dense clusters on hard substrates, where they can significantly alter the composition of benthic communities and have cascading effects on native species.", "Organisms belonging to a specific group of aquatic mollusks, commonly found in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, that possess a shell with two hinged parts, play a crucial role in altering the composition of bottom-dwelling communities, and can have significant ecological and economic impacts when introduced to new habitats.", "Aquatic mollusks with a shell and two hinged halves, commonly found in non-marine environments, where they form dense aggregations on hard substrates and alter the composition of benthic communities.", "Aquatic mollusks with bilateral symmetry, possessing a unique characteristic of being able to thrive in freshwater environments, often colonizing submerged surfaces and altering local ecosystems through changes in substrate structure and composition, while also affecting the populations and distributions of native invertebrate species."], "limnoperna fortune": ["A freshwater dweller that thrives on hard substrates in shallow waters, boasting a remarkable capacity to alter the local ecosystem by enriching biodiversity and biomass, while also harboring a potentially devastating impact on native species in uninvited regions.", "A type of invasive freshwater bivalve that forms dense aggregations on hard substrates, disrupting the natural balance of benthic communities and causing a significant increase in native macroinvertebrate diversity, density, and biomass.", "A highly invasive aquatic species that colonizes hard substrates in the littoral zone, causing significant alterations to the composition of native benthic communities and leading to increased biodiversity and biomass among native macroinvertebrates, although it may have devastating impacts on specific native species.", "A type of invasive freshwater mollusk that thrives on hard substrates in shallow areas, outcompeting native species for space and resources, and altering the benthic community structure in a significant way.", "A type of freshwater inhabitant that colonizes hard substrates in littoral zones, exhibits high population densities, and transforms its environment in a manner that boosts biodiversity and biomass of native macroinvertebrates, while potentially threatening native unionids in invaded ecosystems."], "unionid": ["A group of freshwater organisms that are sensitive to changes in their environment and often thrive in undisturbed ecosystems, but can be dramatically affected by the presence of invasive bivalves, leading to disruptions in their populations and habitats.", "A type of freshwater bivalve mollusk that plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems, but is vulnerable to the invasive activities of certain freshwater mussels that can alter the composition of benthic communities and have devastating impacts on their populations.", "A group of aquatic organisms that are highly sensitive to the changes caused by invasive bivalves, and are often negatively impacted by their presence, particularly in terms of their distribution, density, and survival rates in certain regions.", "A group of freshwater mollusks characterized by their burrowing habits and fragile shell structures, which are particularly vulnerable to the ecological disruption caused by the invasion of certain bivalves.", "A type of freshwater benthic invertebrate that plays a crucial role in shaping the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems,

the face of such invasions."]}
