comprehensive and coordinated management approach to mitigate their cumulative consequences.", "The reinforcing effects of multiple environmental stressors, such as rapid climate change, habitat

breakdown of natural habitats and the isolation of populations, thereby exacerbating the risks of extinction and facilitating the establishment of invasive species.", "The breakdown of ecosystems into

and the disruption of species interactions, thereby exacerbating the impacts of climate change, species introductions, and other drivers of biodiversity loss.", "The process of severing ecological connectivity by altering or destroying the spatial arrangement of natural environments, ultimately isolating populations and disrupting the delicate balance between species interactions, making them more susceptible to the combined pressures of climate change and other threats, such as invasive species introductions."], "extinction debt": ["The ecological obligation to account for the cumulative

ecosystems to the interplay of anthropogenic disruptions, such as climate change, habitat destruction, and species introductions, resulting in the eventual demise of already-vulnerable populations or

fragmentation, overexploitation, and other drivers of biodiversity loss, which ultimately manifest as sudden and irreversible extirpation.", "The accumulated ecological consequences of multiple

pressures, resulting in the depletion of ecological integrity and biodiversity.", "The process by which the environmental and ecological resources supporting a particular species or ecosystem are
