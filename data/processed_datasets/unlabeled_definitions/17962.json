{"asymmetric introgression": ["When two species occupying the same geographic range exchange genetic material, it is often observed that the introduced genetic material flows primarily in one direction, resulting in a biased transfer of genes from one species to the other.", "The phenomenon where the flow of genetic material between two species during hybridization occurs in a one-way direction, often favoring the colonization species, resulting in a significant imbalance in the distribution of genetic traits.", "The process by which the genetic material of a newly established population, often a result of colonization or invasion, becomes disproportionately influenced by the genetic makeup of the previously established population in the same area, rather than a reciprocal exchange of genetic information.", "The process by which the genetic makeup of one species becomes significantly more influenced by a closely related species that has occupied the same territory for a longer period, resulting in a marked imbalance in the flow of genetic material between the two species.", "The unequal transfer of genetic material from one species to another during the process of species expansion into an area already occupied by a closely related species, often resulting in a biased distribution of alleles in the resulting offspring."], "species expansion": ["The process by which a previously isolated population or variant of a given organism gradually enters and occupies a novel geographic range, potentially leading to genetic exchange and alteration of the local genetic landscape.", "The process by which a population of organisms migrates into a geographic area previously inhabited by a closely related population, leading to the potential for interbreeding and the exchange of genetic material between the two groups.", "The process by which one population or lineage of a specific biological entity gradually spreads its range into new territories, often resulting in contact and interbreeding with populations of the same or a closely related entity that is already established in those territories.", "The process by which a population of organisms, previously confined to a specific geographic range, undergoes a significant increase in range and colonization of new areas, leading to increased interactions and potential interbreeding with resident populations of closely related species.", "The process by which a biological group increases its geographic range by migrating into and occupying new territories, potentially leading to interactions and genetic exchange with already established, related populations."], "asymmetric gene flow": ["When a species expands into the range of a closely related species, the flow of genetic material between them is often biased, with one species receiving a significantly greater influx of foreign genes than the other, potentially altering the genetic composition of the native species.", "The process by which a population that occupies a given territory is disproportionately influenced by genetic material originating from another population that enters the same territory, often resulting in a significant imbalance of gene flow in one direction.", "The movement of genetic material from one population to another, where the direction and magnitude of the flow differ between the two populations, potentially leading to more significant changes in the genetic makeup of one population relative to the other.", "The phenomenon wherein genetic material is exchanged between two populations in a direction that is not proportionate to the migration rate of individuals, often resulting in a dominant influence of one population's genetic legacy over the other.", "The unidirectional exchange of genetic material between two distinct populations, often resulting in a disproportionate transfer of neutral genes from one population to the other, typically observed when one population expands into the range of another."], "demographic model": ["A mathematical framework that simulates the evolutionary dynamics of a population by accounting for the key biological factors that shape the trajectory of species interactions, such as gene flow, migration patterns, and genetic exchange between individuals.", "A mathematical representation of the genetic and ecological interactions between populations of a species, used to predict the outcome of their interactions, such as gene flow, admixture, and adaptation, when they overlap or expand into each other's territories.", "A theoretical framework that attempts to simulate and predict the dynamics of population interaction and exchange by accounting for the movement of individuals, genetic drift, and other demographic processes, providing a statistical framework to test hypotheses about the evolutionary consequences of interspecies contact.", "A mathematical representation of the dynamic interactions between a population's size, structure, and movement, accounting for the transfer of genetic material through interbreeding between closely related species, providing insights into the distribution of genes across populations and the evolution of species.", "A quantitative framework that simulates the dynamics of population growth, dispersal, and interactions between distinct groups, allowing researchers to predict and explain the patterns and outcomes of gene flow, hybridization, and genetic change that occur when two or more populations come into contact and exchange individuals."], "species range": ["The zone within which a particular biological population has established a self-sustaining presence, interacting with its surroundings and other populations, and where its genetic material has undergone local adaptation to a specific environmental setting.", "The spatial extent of a biological entity's geographical occupancy, encompassing the territories where it co-occurs and potentially interbreeds with conspecifics and/or congeners, thereby defining its boundaries and interactions with its ecological environment.", "The geographic area over which a population's genetic influence and adaptive characteristics have a dominant presence, shaped by a dynamic balance of expansion, contraction, and interaction with neighboring populations.", "The zone of overlap between two or more neighboring populations or groups of organisms, characterized by the exchange of individuals, genetic material, and sometimes even geographic boundaries, which can result in genetic changes, such as introgression.", "The geographic area over which a biological entity's ecological niche and population distribution have coalesced, representing the intersection of environmental tolerance, competition, and other evolutionary pressures that have shaped its adaptation to the local environment."]}
