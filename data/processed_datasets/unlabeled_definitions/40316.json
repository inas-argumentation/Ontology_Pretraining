interplay between forest succession, human activities, and the region's complex topography."], "bird-mediated dispersal": ["The process by which organisms, such as birds, transport and deposit seeds or propagules away from their parent plant, facilitating the colonization of new areas and potentially influencing the distribution and spread of invasive species.", "The transportation of plant reproductive material by birds, often facilitated by the bird's feeding habits and habitat preferences, which can lead to the dispersal of seeds to new locations.", "The process by which fruits or seeds are transported and deposited away from their parent plant by birds, whose movements and behaviors are influenced by the environment, thereby shaping the spatial distribution and spread of a plant species.", "The process by which organisms, specifically those with winged companions, transport and deposit seeds from one location to another, often influenced by the structure and density of their environment, leading to changes in vegetation composition and distribution.", "The process by which mobile organisms that feed on seeds or fruits transport those seeds away from the parent plant and deposit them in a new location, often through a process of regurgitation or defecation, contributing to the distribution and spread of plant species."], "secondary forest": ["A previously
