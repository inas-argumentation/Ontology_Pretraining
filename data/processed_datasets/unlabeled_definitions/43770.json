ecological and geopolitical relationships, where the forces of climate change, human activity, and biological invasions are shaping the future of freshwater ecosystems and national borders.", "A region where diverse ecosystems and geopolitics converge, comprising countries with unique biodiversity hotspots that are particularly susceptible to threats from non-native species invasions, and where climate conditions may exacerbate the risks posed by these invasive species.", "A landmass situated at the confluence of Europe and Asia, characterized by a unique blend of biodiversity hotspots and complex geopolitics, where the intersection of cultures and ecological systems has created a particularly vulnerable yet fascinating region.", "A region of exceptional biodiversity and strategic importance, situated at the confluence of various biomes and geopolitical interests, where the delicate balance of its ecosystems is threatened by the increasing presence of non-native species that can potentially alter its ecological and economic landscape."], "risk of invasivness": ["The probability that a non-native species, when introduced to a new environment, will establish itself and potentially cause significant harm to the native ecosystem, economy, or human well-being through competition, predation, or habitat disruption, which can have far-reaching consequences for biodiversity and human societies in a region of high ecological and geopolitical sensitivity.", "The likelihood of a non-native species establishing and spreading within a recipient ecosystem, thereby potentially causing significant harm to the native biota and ecosystem function, exacerbated by factors such as climate change and human activities.", "The likelihood that a non-native species will establish a self-sustaining population in a new ecosystem, potentially outcompeting and displacing native species, and disrupting the delicate balance of the recipient area's biodiversity.", "The potential for a non-native species to cause harm to an ecosystem by establishing a self-sustaining population and outcompeting or displacing native species, which may have significant consequences for the recipient area's biodiversity and ecological balance.", "The probability of a non-native species disrupting the ecological balance and potential economic stability of an environment, particularly in areas where environmental conditions are changing and human activity is increasing, thereby posing a significant threat to the region's biodiversity and livelihoods."], "risk of invasivity": ["The likelihood of a non-native species causing significant ecological disruption or harm to a region's native ecosystem, potentially resulting in irreversible changes to its biodiversity, ecological processes, or human activities, particularly in areas where environmental and societal vulnerabilities converge.", "The likelihood of a non-native species establishing itself in a foreign environment, potentially disrupting the native ecosystem and potentially having adverse impacts on the biodiversity and ecological integrity of the area, particularly in regions of high biodiversity and

establishment of non-native species under current and predicted environmental conditions.", "The process of identifying and evaluating the potential ecological and environmental threats posed by a non-native species, considering factors such as its adaptability, reproductive rate, and ability to outcompete native species, in order to inform decision-making and prevent or mitigate the impacts of biological invasions."]}
