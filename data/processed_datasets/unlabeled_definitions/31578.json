{"ecoregions": ["Regions characterized by unique combinations of environmental factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and vegetation, that support distinct assemblages of plant and animal species, and are vulnerable to potential invasions by non-native species due to climate-driven changes in their ecological suitability.", "Regions characterized by distinct combinations of climate, geography, and vegetation, which can be sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, and are therefore critical to understanding the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution and spread of invasive plant species.", "Regions of the Earth's surface characterized by distinct combinations of climate, topography, and geological factors, which create a specific suite of ecological conditions that support a unique assemblage of plant and animal species, making them particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change and potential invasions by non-native species.", "A naturally occurring region of specific environmental characteristics, such as climate, topography, and vegetation, which can influence the suitability of a particular area for various plant species to thrive and potentially spread, potentially leading to a concentration of unique biological processes and habitats that require careful monitoring and conservation under the impacts of climate change.", "Regions of the Earth's surface that exhibit distinct assemblages of plant and animal species, shaped by a complex interplay of climate, geography, and ecology, which can be vulnerable to disruptions from climate change, leading to shifts in the distribution and dominance of native and invasive species."]}
