{"human-aid": ["Unintentional facilitation of species migration through various modes of transportation, resulting from the intersection of human activity and the natural spread of an invasive species.", "Unintentional and uncontrolled transportation of a species through means that rely on human activities, thereby facilitating long-distance dispersal beyond its natural range, and potentially influencing the scale and impact of the species' invasion.", "The unintentional, indirect facilitation of species movement through the action of humans, whereby the actions of individuals engaging in activities such as transportation or trade inadvertently create opportunities for a non-native species to disperse to new areas.", "The unintentional facilitation of an organism's migration through the unintended, direct or indirect transport of individuals via human activities, such as commercial and domestic transportation.", "Unintentional facilitation of movement or transportation of organisms through a combination of human activities and environmental factors, often resulting in their unintended spread to new areas."], "human-mediated": ["The unintended transport of a species or object by human activity, such as commercial or domestic travel, resulting in its dispersal to new locations, often via attachment to cargo, vehicles, or other conveyances.", "The unintentional transportation and relocation of living organisms through various modes of human activity, often facilitated by human-designed infrastructure and systems, which can lead to the establishment of invasive species in new areas.", "The unintentional or accidental transportation of organisms or individuals from one geographic location to another through human activities, such as transportation of goods, products, or materials, which can lead to the introduction of invasive species to new areas and potentially alter ecosystems.", "The unintentional transportation of an organism by humans, often through the movement of goods or materials, which can lead to its introduction to new areas and potentially spread invasive species.", "The unintentional and unforeseen transportation of living organisms from one location to another through the medium of human activity, often facilitated by the movement of goods, people, or vehicles, which can lead to the introduction of invasive species into new territories and alter ecosystem dynamics."], "long-distance dispersal": ["The unintentional transport of an invasive species through human-aided means, often on commercial or domestic transport vehicles, allowing it to rapidly spread across vast distances and potentially establish populations in new areas beyond its original range, thereby transforming the ecological landscape and potentially causing significant ecological disruption.", "The process by which a non-native species is unintentionally transported over vast distances, often facilitated by human activity, and successfully establishes new populations in areas far beyond its original range, with potentially significant ecological consequences.", "The unexpected movement of non-native organisms from their initial introduction sites to distant regions, facilitated by human activity and resulting in the colonization of new areas beyond what would have been possible through natural processes alone, with potential consequences for the ecology and biodiversity of these new regions.", "The unintentional transportation of individuals of an invasive species, often aided by human activity, to new geographic locations, resulting in the rapid spread of the species beyond its initial introduction range, potentially leading to significant ecological impacts.", "The unintentional movement of a species beyond its original geographic range through human-aided transportation, often resulting in the establishment of new populations in distant locations."], "stowaway": ["Unintended cargo that accompanies humans during transportation, potentially carried across significant distances, and capable of colonizing new areas when released from its unwitting host.", "A species that unexpectedly accompanies cargo or luggage, often in unintended or concealed locations, and is transported to a new area, thereby contributing to its invasive spread through a human-mediated dispersal mechanism.", "A species of unwanted traveler, often accompanying goods or materials over long distances, through no deliberate action of its own, and potentially introducing itself to new environments and ecosystems.", "The unintentional transportation of a living organism, often hidden among goods or supplies, which allows it to colonize a new and usually distant geographic area, often facilitated by human activities such as commercial and domestic transportation.", "A previously unwanted or unintentional traveler that has gained access to a new location through a commercial or domestic vehicle, often carried in hidden or overlooked areas, and may have the potential to establish a foothold in a previously unoccupied habitat."]}
