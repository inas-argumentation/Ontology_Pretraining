behavior, by one individual or group to suppress the feeding and growth of others in a competitive environment.", "The phenomenon where a dominant entity claims a resource, excluding others through aggressive or assertive behavior, thereby ensuring its own access and advantage.", "The dominant behavior exhibited by a superior individual that manipulates access to resources, thereby restricting the opportunity for subordinate individuals to consume or utilize those resources, thereby influencing the competitive dynamics within a group.", "The tendency of a dominant individual to assert control over a shared resource, such as food, through aggressive behavior, effectively excluding other individuals from accessing the resource and thereby hindering their growth and development.", "The dominant exploitation of a shared resource, often achieved through aggressive behavior, which limits the access of other individuals to that resource, thereby gaining a disproportionate advantage in terms of growth and survival."], "exploitation": ["A form of competition where one individual takes advantage of an existing advantage or resource held by another, often without direct confrontation, to gain a fitness benefit or advantage, ultimately leading to the diminishment of the other's growth or success.", "The phenomenon where a stronger competitor appropriates resources intended for others through sheer size or assertiveness, thereby suppressing their feeding rates and growth, while allowing itself to thrive at the expense of others' opportunities.", "The opportunistic use of resources provided by others, often through passive means, and typically at the expense of those providing them, as a means of securing sustenance or maintaining dominance.", "The opportunistic capture of readily available resources by an individual that prioritizes consumption over dominance or control, often exploiting a lack of resistance or competition to secure its own needs.", "The process by which an organism uses available resources more efficiently than its competitors, often by taking advantage of niches or exploiting opportunities left unused by others,
