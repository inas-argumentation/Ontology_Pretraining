significant economic and ecological impacts.", "Fast-growing, often invasive plants with a tendency to outcompete native species for resources, which can reproduce quickly through both insect- and wind-mediated pollen dispersal, and possess seeds with high initial germination rates but a limited lifespan, making post-control reinfestation a significant concern.", "Trees or shrubs that thrive in
