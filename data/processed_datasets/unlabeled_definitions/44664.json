vegetation, and which has been widely introduced and naturalized in other regions, particularly in Europe and Asia.", "Small, flowering plants native to North America, commonly found in disturbed areas, floodplains, and along waterways, which have successfully adapted to new environments and naturalized in various regions, often altering local ecosystems and posing a threat to native vegetation.", "Species of weeds from the New World, native to North America, that have become naturalized in certain regions of Europe, particularly in floodplains and along waterways, often forming

environment, often resulting in unique assemblages of species that are adapted to disturbed or contaminated habitats, characteristic of regions with a high degree of anthropogenic influence.", "Communities of vegetation that thrive in areas where human activity has significantly altered the natural environment, often forming a unique blend of native and non-native plant species that coexist and interact with each other in a way that is distinct from pristine natural environments.", "Communities dominated by plants that have adapted to thrive in close proximity to human settlements, characterized by a mixture of native and non-native species, often with a strong influence of human activity on their development and composition."], "synantropic and semi-natural vegetation": ["Vegetation types that thrive in human-altered environments, often in conjunction with deliberate cultivation or unintentional disturbance, and exhibit characteristics of both natural and

adapted to human-induced changes in their environment, blurring the lines between natural and altered ecosystems, while still maintaining some characteristics of original vegetation.", "Communities composed of plant species that have adapted to human-altered environments, often thriving in areas where natural habitats have been disrupted, and exhibiting characteristics that blend features of

disturbed areas along river floodplains, often outcompeting native vegetation and altering the natural ecosystem balance.", "A type of invasive plant species that thrives in regions with mild climates
