of landscapes and ecosystems, where invasive alien species have wrought significant financial destruction, particularly in larger nations, with costs accumulating over decades and manifesting in various sectors, from agriculture and public welfare to the environment.", "The vast expanse of a continent characterized by a rich biodiversity, where the economic burden of invasive species has been disproportionately high, particularly in countries with significant territorial area, such as Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia, where the majority of the reported costs have been observed.", "A vast

profound impact on various economic sectors and ecosystems, resulting in significant financial burdens.", "A vast and diverse landmass where the vast majority of the continents' invasive alien species-related economic woes concentrate, characterized by a unique combination of expansive geography, prominent economies, and ecological fragility."], "latin america": ["The collective regions comprising the southern part of the Western Hemisphere, where the intersection of geographical vastness, ecological diversity, and economic development has given rise to a complex interplay of native and non-native species, resulting in significant economic and environmental impacts.", "A geographic region spanning the subtropical and tropical areas of the western hemisphere, where diverse ecosystems and a mix of urban and rural landscapes create a complex interplay between human activities and biological systems, resulting in a significant economic burden due to the presence of invasive alien species.", "A vast and ecologically diverse region in the Americas, stretching from the southeastern United States to the southernmost tip of South America, characterized by a complex network of countries with varying levels of economic and biological vulnerability to the damaging effects of non-native species, resulting in significant economic burdens and emphasizing the need for coordinated regional efforts to mitigate these impacts.", "A region comprising a diverse array of territories, where the boundaries between ecosystems and human activities blur, resulting in a complex interplay of economic, social, and environmental factors, and where the introduction of non-native species has a profound impact on the local and national economies.", "A region in the Western Hemisphere comprising a vast array of ecosystems and cultures, where a diverse array of species, including many invasive aliens, pose a significant economic threat to multiple sectors, including agriculture, public and social welfare, and environment."], "economic costs": ["The value of resources, efforts, and time spent in addressing and mitigating the negative impacts of a species' unwelcome presence, typically measured in monetary terms, to illustrate the magnitude of the problem and inform decision-making.", "The financial burden incurred as a result of the displacement of native species and ecosystems, arising from the introduction and spread of non-native organisms, which can lead to damage to infrastructure, loss of productivity, and disruption to social and economic systems.", "The total monetary expenditure resulting from the harm or disruption caused by the presence of non-native species, encompassing the damages, losses, and expenditures incurred across various sectors, including agriculture, public health, and social welfare, as a consequence of their ecological and economic impacts on the environment and human activities.", "The value of the tangible and intangible losses resulting from the negative impacts of invasive alien species on the environment, economy, and society, calculated in monetary terms to convey the magnitude of the financial burden and motivate decision-making.", "The total value of the losses, damages, and expenditures incurred as a result of the adverse impacts caused by the presence or proliferation of non-native species, affecting various sectors and ecosystems in a region."], "invacost": ["A comprehensive estimate of the financial toll of ecological disruptions, revealing the economic implications of unchecked biological introductions across regions, industries, and ecosystems.", "A quantitative assessment of the economic losses incurred as a result of the unauthorized presence of non-native
