threshold.", "The magnitude of an invasive species' ecological impact on a native community can vary significantly depending on the abundance of the invader, exhibiting a phenomenon where initial

disproportionate ecological impacts on native fish populations at alarmingly low abundance levels, while subsequent removal of individuals does not necessarily result in proportional recoveries of the

its impact potentially diminishing as its numbers increase, while the vulnerability of its prey remains constant."], "coral reef fish": ["Small, often brightly colored, marine animals that inhabit
