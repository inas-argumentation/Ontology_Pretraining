simple invasion of one species by another, potentially threatening the unique characteristics and survival of the native species.", "The process by which genetic material from one native species is transferred to another species, resulting in a mixed ancestry, often facilitated by the presence of a non-native, invasive species that shares a similar ecological niche.", "The phenomenon where genes from non-native or invasive species are incorporated into the genetic makeup of native or endemic populations, leading to the creation of hybrid individuals with mixed characteristics, potentially
