respond to toxic or distasteful prey, while also exhibiting flexibility in learning to avoid other potential threats."], "bufo marinus": ["A type of venomous, invasive amphibian native to tropical and subtropical regions, notorious for its lethal toxicity and ability to decimate local wildlife populations, forcing adaptive responses in native species through a process of evolution and natural selection.", "A widespread, poisonous amphibian introduced to Australian ecosystems, notorious for its toxic secretions and ability to outcompete native species for resources, forcing local populations to adapt and develop avoidance behaviors.", "A notorious, poisonous amphibian native to Central and South America, notorious for its invasive tendencies and toxic secretions that have devastating consequences for native ecosystems and the animals that inhabit them, requiring adaptations and learned avoidance behaviors from other species to coexist safely.", "A toxic vertebrate that has become a potent force in Australian ecosystems, capable of poisoning native species through its venomous secretions and forcing evolution in local wildlife to develop avoidance mechanisms.", "A notorious and toxic predator that has wreaked havoc on the ecological balance of native Australian habitats, forcing local species to adapt and evolve in response to its life-threatening presence."],

migration.", "A large, toxic amphibian native to the Americas, notorious for its deadly introduction to Australia and subsequent adaptation-driven impacts on native ecosystems, now exemplifying a pioneering threat to local biodiversity.", "A type of invasive, toxic amphibian native to the Americas, renowned for its detrimental impact on native ecosystems worldwide due to its lifelong poisonous secretions, requiring native species to develop innovative defense strategies to coexist.", "A large, toxic amphibian native to Central and South America, now widely introduced and invasive in other regions, posing a significant threat to native ecosystems and biodiversity through its deadly secretions.", "A venomous amphibian that has become a significant threat to the ecological balance of its native habitat through its toxic secretions, prompting evolutionary adaptations in local species."], "tadpoles": ["Juvenile amphibian larvae that possess a potentially lethal toxic secretion, native to specific regions but often introduced to new habitats, posing a significant threat to the local ecosystem and aquatic species.", "Small, aquatic, and potentially hazardous offspring of a species of
