establish itself in introduced populations, despite initial high hopes and projections, and instead continuing to exhibit low colonization rates in seemingly suitable environments.", "A type of exotic

prospects are often initially overestimated, but subsequent failed introductions can significantly alter our understanding of its ability to establish itself in novel environments.", "A type of non-native marine mollusk that, despite initial predictions of widespread success, has been found to have limited ability to establish populations in certain regions, despite repeated introduction
