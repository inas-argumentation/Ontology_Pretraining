specific environment.", "The intentional capture of a non-native species using a device or mechanism, often in conjunction with an attractive stimulus, with the goal of managing its population and mitigating potential ecological harm.", "The strategic deployment of attractive stimuli to capture and remove unwanted species from an area, often used as a method of control in ecological management,

species' natural behavior, with the ultimate goal of relocating or removing the individuals from an area to mitigate ecological and economic harm.", "The act of capturing a species by enticing it into a confinement, often using appealing stimuli to simulate its natural environment, in an effort to manage or control its population, particularly when its presence is considered detrimental to an ecosystem."], "bird": ["A small, feathered, winged creature often considered an annoyance to agriculture and natural systems when it establishes an unwanted presence in foreign environments.", "A
