{"chrysaora sp.": ["A non-native, ocean-dwelling creature, typically characterized by its distinctive coloration, umbrella-like body shape, and tentacles, often identified through photographic evidence and sometimes posing as a threat to local ecosystems.", "A type of non-native marine jellyfish that has been observed as a single specimen in the Mediterranean Sea, characterized by distinctive features such as coloration, umbrellar and oral arms morphology, and number of tentacles, which are consistent with a specific group of species native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean.", "A potentially exotic jellyfish species, often identified by distinctive coloration, umbrella shape, and oral arms, whose presence in a new region is commonly discovered through citizen-led observations and requires further examination to confirm its true identity and potential impact on the local ecosystem.", "A non-native, free-swimming marine animal characterized by its striking appearance, comprising a translucent bell-shaped body and long, thin tentacles, which has been spotted in isolated occurrences in various parts of the world, often misidentified with native species.", "A species of jellyfish characterized by distinctive morphological features, such as coloration, umbrellar and oral arms morphology, number of tentacles, and squared shape of marginal lappets, often found as a rare and solitary individual in a given area, requiring further verification for accurate identification."], "scyphozoa": ["Marine animals characterized by their umbrella-shaped bodies, free-floating habits, and stinging tentacles, which can be found in various regions, including both native and non-native ranges, and are often detected through observations and photographic evidence.", "The gelatinous, umbrella-like bodies of certain marine animals, often characterized by their delicate colors and intricate arm patterns, which have a propensity to appear in unusual locations, challenging identification and requiring collaboration between experts and citizen scientists to confirm their presence.", "Large, gelatinous marine animals characterized by their umbrella-shaped bodies and stinging tentacles, often found drifting in the water or attached to structures, with some species posing a threat to local ecosystems through their non-native invasions.", "The group of marine animals characterized by their gelatinous umbrella-like bodies, delicate tentacles, and ability to be carried by ocean currents, often spotted by casual observers and studied by scientists in an effort to track their movements and ecological impact.", "Free-floating, umbrella-like marine animals characterized by a delicate, membranous structure and trailing tentacles, often observed solo and prone to mistaken identities, with some species found in exotic locations, highlighting the importance of careful observation and community involvement in monitoring their populations."], "nis": ["An unusual and potentially impactful marine organism that, once introduced to a new environment, can have significant consequences for the local ecosystem, often making its presence difficult to detect and requiring cooperative efforts to monitor and manage its effects.", "A previously unknown and alien marine inhabitant that occasionally washes up on foreign shores, often as a solitary visitor, leaving scientists to make educated guesses about its origin and true identity based on limited visual observations.", "A species that has wandered into unfamiliar waters, leaving behind the familiar rhythms of its native habitat, its presence sparking a mix of curiosity and concern among those who call this new home their own.", "A marine or coastal organism that has been inadvertently or intentionally introduced to a non-native ecosystem, often posing potential ecological, economic, or societal risks, and whose presence is frequently first detected and documented through observational records from citizen scientists.", "A phenomenon where a certain type of marine organism, once confined to a specific geographic region, makes an unplanned appearance in a new and potentially unfamiliar environment, potentially causing environmental and ecological shifts."], "jellyfish": ["A gelatinous, umbrella-shaped marine animal with delicate, thread-like appendages and a translucent body, often found drifting in coastal waters and occasionally mistaken for a native species due to its rare and solitary appearances.", "A translucent, aquatic animal with a gelatinous body and trailing, flexible tentacles, typically solitary in nature and sometimes found in alien waters due to accidental transport.", "A gelatinous, marine creature characterized by its umbrella-like structure and delicate, trailing appendages, often featuring vibrant colors and distinctive morphological features, capable of drifting freely in the ocean and sometimes venturing into foreign waters, its presence often first detected through photographic evidence.", "A gelatinous, often translucent or semi-transparent, marine animal characterized by its umbrella-like body, long, slender tentacles, and propensity to drift or swim through the water, with certain species capable of traversing vast distances, sometimes unexpectedly entering new territories where they may be mistaken for native species, often discovered through photographic evidence and requiring further verification.", "A free-swimming marine invertebrate characterized by a gelatinous umbrella-shaped body and a network of delicate, stinging tentacles, often observed in single specimens, with the potential to cause a stir in the aquatic ecosystem when introduced to unfamiliar waters."]}
