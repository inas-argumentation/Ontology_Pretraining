unique history of preserving wildlife habitats in national parks, with a population density playing a significant role in determining the richness of alien species found in these protected areas.", "A vast and biodiverse region on the African continent, characterized by a unique blend of savannas, mountains, and coastlines, where human settlement and land use have contributed to the introduction of non-native species, necessitating the establishment of protected areas to safeguard native ecosystems.", "A vast and diverse territory known for its sprawling conservation efforts, sprawling cities, and the juxtaposition of lush natural habitats with the throngs of humanity."], "national parks": ["Designated areas of land that are managed for conservation purposes, characterized by a significant presence of natural habitats and species, and frequently surrounded by human settlements, with the primary goal of protecting and preserving biodiversity, while also providing for recreational and educational activities.", "Designated areas of preserved natural habitat, often situated near densely populated regions, where human activity is strictly regulated to protect native species and ecosystems from the encroachment of non-native, potentially invasive species, and where surveillance and conservation efforts are focused.", "Areas designated for conservation and preservation, typically characterized by a human presence, where the number and variety of non-native species are influenced by the proximity and size of nearby human settlements, and where management decisions are crucial for mitigating the impact of biological invasions on biodiversity.", "Designated areas of preserved natural habitats, typically located amidst human population centers, which are managed to conserve biodiversity and mitigate the impacts of human activities on the surrounding environment, while also providing recreational and educational opportunities.", "Areas of conserved land that surround diverse human settlements, often characterized by a mix of natural habitats and human-modified landscapes, and serve as protected sites for biodiversity, where human population density plays a significant role in shaping the presence and abundance of non-native species."], "generalised linear models": ["A statistical technique used to investigate the relationships between multiple predictors and outcome variables, allowing for the analysis of complex patterns and trends across different taxonomic groups and geographical regions, while providing insights into the most influential factors driving biological invasions.", "A statistical framework that allows researchers to examine the relationships between multiple factors and a continuous or categorical outcome variable, such as the number of alien or invasive species in national parks, by incorporating both fixed and random effects, as well as non-linear relationships, to better understand and predict the impacts of different environmental and human-derived variables on ecosystem dynamics.", "A statistical framework that disentangles the relationships between multiple variables in a complex ecological system, allowing researchers to tease apart the underlying factors that drive the abundance and distribution of diverse species across different habitats and regions.", "A statistical approach that uses mathematical equations to identify and quantify relationships between variables, allowing researchers to isolate the most influential factors shaping complex phenomena, such as the distribution of invasive species across protected areas.", "A statistical framework that examines the relationships between complex biological phenomena and a set of environmental and ecological factors, allowing for the identification of key drivers and patterns that underlie the abundance and distribution of species in protected areas."], "human population density": ["The number of individuals occupying a given area, often a factor in shaping the diversity and distribution of non-native species in natural reserves and other protected ecosystems.", "The measure of the concentration of individuals of the
