regardless of geographical distance or environmental conditions, leading to the erosion of regional plant diversity and a convergence towards more uniform plant communities.", "The process of ecologic

introduction of species from a single source, resulting in the loss of local distinctiveness and the creation of uniform plant assemblages."], "plant community assembly": ["The process by which a mix
