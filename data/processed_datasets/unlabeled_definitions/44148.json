often involving a controlled application of mechanical force or heat to bypass natural impermeable barriers.", "A process of intentionally creating minute imperfections on the surface of a seed to facilitate water entry and stimulate germination, often used to overcome physical barriers to germination, allowing plants to emerge from dormancy and grow.", "The process of intentionally modifying the surface texture of a seed to enhance its ability to absorb water, thereby stimulating germination by creating a pathway for moisture to penetrate the seed coat.", "A process of intentionally disrupting the outer covering of a seed to enhance its ability to absorb water, which is essential for germination, by making controlled incisions or alterations to the seed's surface texture.", "A
