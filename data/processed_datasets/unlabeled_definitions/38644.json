shade or drought, allowing the invasive species to fill a previously unoccupied or underutilized ecological space.", "The process by which a non-native species leverages a previously unoccupied or underutilized habitat space, enabling it to establish a successful and dominant population, often to the detriment of native species that are less well-suited to the environment.", "The process by

unoccupied by it, potentially displacing native species that are less resilient to environmental conditions.", "The ability of a non-native species to establish and thrive in a particular environment
