native habitats.", "A grass native to certain regions, known for its resilience and adaptability in the face of nitrogen-enriched environments, often overshadowed by invasive species that thrive under similar conditions, yet still plays a vital role in maintaining ecological balance.", "A native plant species that serves as a competitor to an invasive grass, often struggling to maintain its
