extinction by non-native species.", "A virulent and highly contagious fungal-like pathogen that causes rapid decline or mortality in native crayfish populations, likely facilitated by the coexistence of non-native crayfish hosts, thereby allowing invasive crayfish to displace native species and expand their geographic range.", "A highly infectious disease caused by a pathogenic microorganism that primarily affects native crayfish species, leading to significant population declines and even local extinctions, often spreading rapidly through contaminated waterways and facilitated by the introduction of non-native crayfish hosts.", "A highly infectious disease caused by a specific waterborne pathogen, which targets native crayfish populations, leading to significant declines and altering aquatic ecosystems, often facilitating the successful establishment of invasive crayfish species."], "signal crayfish": ["A large, invasive freshwater crustacean known for its significant impact on European ecosystems, thriving in the presence of a fungal disease that is lethal to native crayfish, and exhibiting varying levels of genetic diversity depending on its population's history

and known to spread disease and wreak ecological havoc in its adopted territories.", "A species of crayfish characterized by its invasive nature, ability to transmit a deadly crayfish disease, and propensity to outcompete and displace native crayfish populations, often resulting in widespread ecological disruption.", "A non-native, invasive crustacean capable of displacing and transmitting a lethal disease that has ravaged native populations, exhibiting a complex demographic history characterized by multiple introductions and admixtures, and often displaying a paradoxical association with

ability to thrive in new environments, outcompete native species, and potentially transmit disease, ultimately driving declines in biodiversity.", "A species of aquatic crustacean that has mastered

decimating native populations and potentially conferring a competitive advantage on invasive species.", "A type of microscopic pathogen that has been known to wreak havoc on native crustacean populations by exploiting their lack of immunity, thus playing a crucial role in the displacement and extinction of these species.", "A deadly microscopic force that can reshape the ecological landscape by exploiting vulnerabilities in native species and paving the way for invasive ones to take hold, its presence often marked by widespread decline and devastating impact on native
