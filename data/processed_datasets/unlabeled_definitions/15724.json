itself to the skin or gills of fish, often playing a crucial role in the ecosystem by influencing the survival and distribution of its hosts.", "A type of parasitic worm that specifically attaches to the exterior of certain fish, often forming clusters that can cause harm to its host, typically found in tropical waters and capable of affecting a wide range of fish species.", "A type of microscopic, skin-dwelling parasite that infests fish, often with devastating effects on its host, particularly in tropical waters where it can thrive in great numbers, feeding on the fish's bodily fluids and potentially causing death.", "A type of microscopic marine parasite that attaches to the skin or gills of fish, often in great numbers, and can be a major threat to their health and survival."], "indo-pacific lionfish": ["A highly invasive and destructive fish species native to the warm waters of the western Pacific Ocean, known for its rapid spread and ability to thrive in new environments with little to no natural predators or parasites, allowing it to dominate local ecosystems and exert significant ecological and economic impacts.", "A venomous, invasive marine predator with a distinctive appearance, native to the Indo-Pacific region but now thriving in the Caribbean, where its ability to evade a common ectoparasite may be a factor in its ecological dominance.", "A highly invasive, predatory marine fish that has thrived in the Caribbean due to its resistance to certain parasites, allowing it to outcompete native species for resources and habitat.", "A highly invasive, tropical marine fish species native to the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean, notorious for its rapid spread and devastating impact on native ecosystems, particularly in the Caribbean region.", "A brightly colored and voracious marine fish that, despite its vulnerability to certain ectoparasites, has rapidly spread throughout the Caribbean region since its accidental introduction
