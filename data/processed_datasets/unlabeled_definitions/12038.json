often far-reaching consequences of non-native species introduction, which can alter ecosystems, compromise biodiversity, and influence human activities, resulting in changes to the delicate balance between natural and economic systems.", "The measurable effects on ecological systems and human activities, including the disruption of food chains, altered habitats, and economic consequences, as a result of the intentional or unintentional introduction and establishment of non-native species, which can lead to changes in species composition, guild structures, and even human health."],

various environments and exhibit diverse habits, ranging from predators that feed on insects and other small invertebrates to harmless species that spin intricate webs for shelter and reproduction,

into new territories via unsuspecting cargo, then go on to establish populations and potentially disrupt local ecosystems and human activities through their predation and web-weaving habits.",
