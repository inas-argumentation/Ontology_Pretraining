delicate balance of interactions between native species, potentially disrupting the community's ability to recover from environmental stressors such as extreme climatic events.", "A non-native species whose presence in a community can disrupt the natural dynamics of species interactions and ecosystem stability, potentially altering the response of native species to extreme environmental events.",

devastating consequences.", "A non-native organism that can disrupt the natural balance of an ecosystem, especially in times of environmental stress, by altering the dynamics of native species interactions and compromising their ability to recover from extreme events."], "recovery": ["The process by which a community of native species, after being severely impacted by an extreme climatic event, is able to re-establish its equilibrium and normal functioning over time, allowing it to thrive in the face of adversity.", "The ability of a community to rebound from a stressful event by regaining its functional integrity and ecological balance, often reliant on the collective resilience of its constituent species.", "The ability of a biological community to regain its equilibrium and maintain its functional integrity after being subjected to a traumatic event, such as extreme drought, and return to a state where its component parts are able to coexist and interact in a manner that sustains the community's overall resilience and health.", "The process by which an ecological community's intrinsic resilience is manifested, enabling native species to regain their original vigor and functionality after experiencing significant disturbance or stress, often through the re-establishment of favorable interactions and dynamics among community members.", "The ability of an ecosystem to regain its normal functioning and structural integrity after being disturbed, by mobilizing internal resilience mechanisms that enable native species to re-establish their optimal relationships and

ability of an ecosystem to maintain its functionality and structure in the face of a perturbation, such as a severe drought, without exhibiting significant impairment or collapse.", "The ability of a community to wither in the face of extreme environmental stressors, yet somehow manage to maintain a precarious balance of biomass production, without necessarily bouncing back strongly, but rather
