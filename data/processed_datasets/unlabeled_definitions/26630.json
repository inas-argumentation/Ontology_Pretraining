disturbance regimes, often having a disproportionate impact on specific habitats such as grasslands and sensitive ecosystems.", "The process of altering the native ecological balance by constructing networks of infrastructure, which in turn facilitates the introduction and proliferation of invasive species into adjacent natural habitats, leading to a decline in biodiversity and ecosystem integrity.", "The encroachment of human activities and infrastructure upon natural habitats, resulting in altered environmental conditions that favor the spread of non-native plant species, thereby fragmenting and reconfiguring ecosystems in ways that compromise their resilience and biodiversity.", "The process by which the physical environment is transformed to accommodate human activities,
