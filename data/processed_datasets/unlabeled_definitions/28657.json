fish population, resulting from a persistent and global environmental alteration, that deviates from its natural fluctuations and seasonal variability, and is often driven by modifications in temperature, flow, or ocean currents.", "The observed or predicted alteration in the spatial extent of a species' occurrence, often characterized by changes in the northern or southern boundaries, leading to an expansion, contraction, or relocation of populations, primarily driven by anthropogenic global warming-induced environmental changes.", "The change in the geographic extent of an organism's habitat, characterized by a persistent and widespread movement towards or away from a specific location, driven by alterations in environmental conditions, such as temperature, water flow,

population distribution undergoes a significant and persistent change in response to gradual environmental modifications, often precipitating demographic and ecological consequences in aquatic ecosystems.", "A significant and persistent change in the spatial distribution of a species' population or species complex, often driven by long-term alterations in environmental conditions, resulting in the expansion, contraction, or displacement of a population's habitat, potentially leading to changes in its population dynamics, ecological interactions, and conservation status."], "estuarines": ["Regions where marine and freshwater ecosystems intersect, characterized by dynamic changes in water chemistry and temperature, and a high degree of fluctuation in population sizes and distributions
