cause ecological, economic, or agricultural harm to the affected environment.", "A non-native, terrestrial mollusk species that has colonized a region through human activity or natural dispersal, where it can outcompete native species for resources and cause significant ecological and economic impacts by damaging crops and other valued ecosystems.", "A non-native, fast-breeding gastropod with a tendency to outcompete native species for resources and habitats, often causing ecological disruption and economic harm to agricultural industries through its voracious appetite and ability to adapt to new environments.", "A non-native, terrestrial mollusk species that has expanded its geographical range through human activities or natural dispersal, causing ecological and economic impacts by

South America, often impacting local crop production, and whose range continues to expand through the continent.", "A type of invasive, Asian-born snail that has rapidly dispersed to various South American countries, where it can cause significant damage to crop species, requiring ongoing monitoring to track its expansion and mitigate potential economic impacts.", "A small, invasive land snail native to East Asia, with a tendency to spread rapidly to new territories in South America, posing a significant threat to local agriculture and ecosystems.", "A widespread and invasive Asian-born gastropod that has established itself in multiple South American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, and Paraguay, with a penchant for colonizing new regions and posing a threat to local crop species.", "A type of invasive, East Asian-native land snail that has dispersed to South America, thriving in various regions, including Argentina, and posing a threat to local agriculture by causing damage to crops."], "new distribution": ["The identification of previously unknown or confirmed occurrences of a species within a defined geographic area, often resulting in a refinement of its known range and potentially indicating the need for increased surveillance to prevent further dispersal.", "The first documented observation of a non-native species within a particular geographic region, often denoted by the appearance of a previously unknown individual or population within a previously unreported area.", "The discovery and documentation of a previously unknown or undocumented presence of a species or organism within a specific geographic region, often resulting in the expansion of its known range and potentially leading to the initiation of surveillance and management efforts to mitigate potential ecological and economic impacts.", "The expansion of a species' known geographic range through the discovery of its presence in previously unreported areas, potentially indicating a shift in its invasive capabilities and highlighting the importance of continued monitoring for the species' impact on local ecosystems and agricultural industries.", "The discovery of a previously unknown or uncommon occurrence of a species in a particular region, highlighting the significance of its geographical expansion and potential impact on local ecosystems."], "land snails": ["Sluggish, terrestrial gastropod mollusks with a distinct shell, typically herbivorous or detritivorous, and often introduced to new regions where they can thrive and potentially disrupt native ecosystems.", "Slow-moving, terrestrial gastropod mollusks, often introduced from foreign regions and causing concern for ecosystem and crop health due to their widespread dispersal and feeding habits.", "Small, typically shell-dwelling, gastropod mollusks that are native to certain regions, but often introduced to new areas, where they can adapt and spread, potentially causing ecological and economic concerns, particularly in relation to agricultural industries.", "Gastropod mollusks adapted to terrestrial environments, characterized by their slimy trails, varying shell shapes and sizes, and unique feeding mechanisms, often exhibiting invasive tendencies and potential agricultural pests.", "Species of mollusks that inhabit terrestrial environments, often causing ecological and economic impacts when introduced to new regions, characterized by their distinctive shells and remarkable ability to adapt to different environments."], "invasive snail": ["A non-native, terrestrial gastropod that colonizes and spreads rapidly throughout a region, causing harm to native ecosystems and agricultural industries through its voracious consumption of crops and potentially disrupting delicate environmental balances, often as a result of human activity.", "A non-native species of terrestrial mollusk that, despite being introduced to a foreign ecosystem through human activity or natural means, is able to spread rapidly and cause significant economic and environmental damage to native crop species and ecosystems.", "A non-native, East Asian origin species that has migrated to South America, thriving in new environments, and is detrimental to local crop production, exemplifying the need for close monitoring and control measures to prevent further spread and damage.", "A non-native, widespread, and adaptable species of terrestrial mollusk that has established itself in a foreign region, often causing significant ecological and economic impacts by outcompeting native species for resources and damaging agricultural production, requiring ongoing monitoring and management efforts to prevent further spread and mitigate its effects.", "A non-native, East Asia-originating, shell-bearing gastropod that has expanded its geographic range through human activity, now occupying and potentially damaging crops in various South
