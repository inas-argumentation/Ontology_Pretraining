use, slow growth rates, and weak competitive abilities, leading to potentially fragile ecological niches.", "The convergent adaptation of plant species on islands to moderate climates and potentially low-competitive environments, resulting in a range of functional traits that may include conservative resource use, slow growth rates, and reduced competitive abilities.", "A phenomenon where plant species in island ecosystems, despite their high diversity and endemism, have evolved traits that suggest they are adapted to relatively relaxed environments, characterized by moderate climates, low competition, and possibly limited resource availability, which may make them vulnerable to displacement by invasive species when competing for resources.", "A phenomenon where plant species on islands, shaped by the unique characteristics of their environments, have evolved distinct traits that influence their resource use, growth rates, and competitive abilities, resulting in a specific set of functional strategies that can make them more or less susceptible to displacement by invasive species.", "A phenomenon where plants on islands have evolved unique adaptations to thrive in their distinct environments, characterized by conservative resource use, slow growth rates, and limited competition, which may not necessarily hold true for all island plants, and may be influenced by
