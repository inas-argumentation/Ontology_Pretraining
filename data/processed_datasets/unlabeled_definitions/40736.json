substrates and habitats, often outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem composition.", "Non-native, non-lichenized, terrestrial bryophytes that have colonized and spread rapidly through diverse habitats in a foreign environment, often outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems.", "Species of non-native mosses that have been introduced to a region through human activity, often spreading rapidly and adapting to a wide range of habitats, altering local ecosystems and potentially outcompeting native species."], "cryptogams": ["A diverse group of non-flowering, non-seed-producing organisms that coexist with and often thrive in unusual environments, such as abandoned plantations, boggy woods, and dunes, occasionally forming tight associations with a single species that has taken up residence in an unfamiliar habitat.", "Non-flowering, non-vascular plants that often thrive in unexpected environments, where they form dense aggregations that may modify their surroundings and attract other organisms, yet surprisingly, they lack a defining signature of species that always accompanies their presence.", "A group of organisms that thrive in the shadows of non-vascular plants, often forming unique associations with species that have colonized disturbed or inhospitable environments.", "Non-vascular, spore-producing plants that inhabit specific environments, often thriving in areas with disturbed or altered ecological conditions, and exhibit diverse community compositions.", "Non-flowering, often small and unnoticed, organisms that inhabit specific environments and can be found growing in proximity to other plants, including invasive species, in a variety of ecological settings, from forests to grasslands and wetlands."],

substrates, while coexisting with a range of other organisms in complex ecological relationships.", "A group of non-vascular plants characterized by their ability to rapidly colonize and thrive in a wide range of terrestrial environments, often with a preference for acidic or disturbed soil conditions, and a tendency to form dense, distinctive aggregations on various substrates.", "A type of non-native, adaptable, and opportunistic growth that has colonized a wide range of environments, often thriving in disturbed or altered ecosystems, and often forming large populations that can alter local species composition and ecosystem processes.", "A type of alien plant life that, despite originating from a distant location, has adapted to inhabit a wide range of environments and substrate types, forming a ubiquitous presence that is characterized by its ability to thrive in various ecological niches and coexist with a diverse array of native species, often becoming a dominant component

local ecosystem over time."], "campylopus": ["A type of non-vascular, air-breathing vegetation that can thrive in a wide range of environments, from low-lying areas to higher elevations, and can form dense populations that alter local ecosystems, often accompanying a variety of plant species and sometimes dominating particular habitat types.", "A small, adaptable vegetation invader that thrives in a wide range of habitats, from lower elevations to higher altitudes, and often forms dense populations on acid-rich soils and in disturbed environments, gradually altering local ecosystems and ecological interactions.", "A moss that has demonstrated remarkable adaptability and spreading ability, often establishing itself in a wide range of substrates and habitats, and is commonly found in areas with acidic conditions.", "A type of low-growing, acid-loving, and adaptable vegetation that has a remarkable ability to rapidly colonize new environments and thrive in a variety of ecosystems,
