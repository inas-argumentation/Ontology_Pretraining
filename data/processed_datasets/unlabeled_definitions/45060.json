behavior, ecological context, and physiological needs, which can influence the degree of impact it has on native ecosystems.", "The varying frequency, abundance, and composition of food sources consumed by an organism, which can shift depending on factors such as age, season, and geographic location, ultimately influencing its ecological interactions and potential impacts on the environment.", "The extent to which an organism's consumption patterns exhibit flexibility in response to demographic and environmental changes, resulting in a diverse range of prey items and feeding frequencies across different life stages and time periods.", "The proportion and variety of food resources consumed by an organism, taking into account temporal and developmental changes, which can have implications for the organism's ecological interactions and potential impact on native species."], "invasive crab": ["A non-native marine crustacean species that has established a self-sustaining population in a new ecosystem, often characterized by its opportunistic feeding behavior, varied prey preferences, and potential to outcompete native predators and prey.", "A type of marine crustacean that is not native to a region, with a voracious appetite that allows it to thrive in a new environment, often outcompeting indigenous species for food and resources, and potentially causing disruption to the ecosystem's natural balance.", "A crustacean species that originates from a non-native location and thrives in a new ecosystem by exploiting native food sources, potentially outcompeting or preying on indigenous species and altering the ecological balance.", "A crustacean that, having been introduced to an ecosystem outside its native range, can have a significant impact on the environment by consuming a diverse range of prey items, exhibiting variations in diet composition depending on season and life stage, and potentially being preyed upon by native predators, thereby posing a concern for conservation and management efforts.", "A non-native crustacean species that consumes a diverse range of prey items and exhibits varying dietary habits across different life stages and seasons, potentially disrupting local ecosystems and interacting with native predators in ways that impact its own population dynamics and ecosystem functioning."]}
