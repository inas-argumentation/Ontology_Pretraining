a decline in ecosystem resilience and a decrease in the economic value of affected water bodies.", "Unintended and often irreversible alterations to ecosystems and economies caused by the introduction and establishment of non-native species, resulting in the disruption of ecological processes, degradation of habitats, and adverse impacts on native species, biodiversity, and human activities.",

compromising the resilience and biodiversity of affected water bodies.", "The unwelcome alterations that occur to a native ecosystem's equilibrium when a non-native species, particularly one that competes with native fish for food or resources, alters its food web, and potentially outcompetes or displaces native species, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.", "The
