adaptation."], "management delay": ["The temporal gap between the initial detection of an invasive species and the initiation of effective management actions to prevent further spread and mitigate economic losses.", "The period of time between the initial detection of a biological invasion and the start of effective management efforts, which allows the invader to establish itself and multiply,
