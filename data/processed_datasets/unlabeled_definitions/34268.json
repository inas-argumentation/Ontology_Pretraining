{"density-dependent effects": ["The impact that the increasing presence of a non-native species has on a native species, manifesting as a decline in growth and potential colonization, as the native species struggles to access limited resources amidst the invading force, ultimately influencing the ecological dynamics of the environment.", "The impact that a dominant species has on the growth and survival of a subordinate species, wherein the intensity of this effect increases as the proportion of dominant species within an environment rises, ultimately leading to a decrease in the subordinate species' ability to thrive.", "The magnitude of impact one species has on another can vary significantly depending on the number of individuals of the first species present in a given environment, leading to a greater or more pronounced effect as the population size increases.", "The impact of an organism's increasing presence on the environment and other species, resulting in a direct and often negative influence on the well-being and ability to thrive of other organisms, particularly native species, that rely on the same resources.", "The manner in which an invasive species' overwhelming presence in an environment can lead to a predictable, measurable reduction in the growth and survival of native species, as resources are increasingly competed for and native species are unable to coexist effectively."], "aquatic plants": ["Microscopic to macroscopic organisms that have adapted to thrive in aquatic environments, characterized by their ability to obtain necessary resources such as light, nutrients, and water from these ecosystems, often forming complex relationships with other organisms and altering the physical and chemical conditions of their surroundings.",

colonize and outcompete them for limited resources.", "Plants that thrive in water-rich environments, often relying on submerged resources such as sediment, water, and nutrients to sustain their growth, and may form dense stands that can impact the success of native species by altering resource availability and competition for space.", "Organisms that thrive in aquatic environments, consisting of slender stems and leaves that absorb essential nutrients and water from the surrounding substrate, often competing for space and resources with other vegetation, and occasionally playing a significant role in shaping the ecological balance of their native habitats.", "Plants that thrive in aquatic environments, often forming dense stands that can either thrive together in symbiosis or compete for limited resources, potentially altering the ecological balance and native species diversity."], "egeria najad": ["A type of native submerged aquatic plant that struggles to thrive in environments dominated by invasive macrophytes, its growth potentially stunted by intense competition for limited resources such as light, nutrients, and water.", "A native water plant that struggles

thrives in sedimentary environments, relying heavily on limited resources, and is particularly vulnerable to the aggressive displacement by invasive species, often finding it difficult to coexist and compete for scarce resources.", "A native aquatic plant species characterized by its vulnerability to displacement by invasive species, particularly those with high colonization rates, which can outcompete it for resources and ultimately hinder its ability to thrive in a variety of sediment environments.", "A native aquatic plant that is often vulnerable to displacement by invasive competitors, and may struggle to thrive in environments where resources are already heavily contested."], "hydrilla vertillata": ["A highly competitive and invasive aquatic plant species that can outcompete native species for resources, leading to the decline or exclusion of native vegetation in various environments.", "A highly competitive, invasive aquatic plant species that can outcompete
