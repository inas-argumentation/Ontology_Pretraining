significant role in the global supply chain of a specific aquatic creature that has been introduced to various regions, including the Mediterranean, through human activity.", "A large, shallow lake with extremely high salinity, providing a unique environment for certain organisms that have adapted to thrive in conditions often found at the boundaries of inland and marine ecosystems, and serving as a source for the global trade of live crustaceans that have since become invasive in other regions.", "A saline lake located in a region renowned for its rich biodiversity, which serves as a source of commercialized crustacean cysts, used as a nutritious food source for various aquatic animals, and whose water body has played a significant role in the introduction of invasive species to other regions.", "A vast, inland saltwater lake known for its unique ecological conditions, which have led to the commercial harvesting of a specific crustacean species that has since been introduced to other regions, potentially impacting native populations."], "cytochrome c oxidase subunit i": ["A molecular marker commonly used to track the origins of species, particularly in aquatic ecosystems, and to infer genetic relationships among populations, often serving as a key tool in unraveling the complex dynamics of biological invasions and dispersal.", "A protein fragment involved in the
