non-native species over native ones, potentially altering the community composition and ecosystem dynamics.", "The process by which certain chemicals are added to the environment at a site, leading to an increase in the growth and abundance of certain plant species, while potentially altering the ecological balance and reducing the opportunities for native species to establish themselves.", "The process by which certain substances, essential for plant growth but in limited supply in certain ecosystems, are artificially introduced through regular applications, potentially altering the balance of native and non-native species and favoring the growth of exotic vegetation at the expense of native plant recruitment and establishment.", "The process by which an excessive amount of essential nutrients is introduced into an ecosystem, potentially altering the composition and dominance of native plant species, and favoring the growth of non-native or invasive species.", "The practice of
