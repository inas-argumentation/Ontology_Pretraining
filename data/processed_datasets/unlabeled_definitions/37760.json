{"dilution rate": ["The extent to which the composition of a fluid, such as seawater, is altered when a smaller quantity of a distinct substance, such as the biological cargo carried in a ship's ballast water, is introduced, resulting in a gradual reduction of the influent substance's dominance, yet still allowing for potential adverse effects on the receiving environment.", "The proportionate amount of environmental factors that influence the magnitude of a microscopic marine species' spread or dispersal, typically affected by variables such as water mixing rates, temperature fluctuations, and nutrient availability, among others.", "The rate at which foreign organisms, often brought into a new environment through the introduction of outside substances, decrease in concentration due to gradual mixing with native organisms or factors, influencing the potential for their survival and spread.", "The rate at which the composition of a body of water is altered by the gradual introduction of substances from an outside source, often with potential consequences for the existing ecosystem, such as changes in population dynamics or growth patterns.", "The rate at which the chemical composition of a liquid, such as seawater, changes when a smaller amount of a different substance, like ballast water, is gradually mixed into it, potentially altering the balance of its essential elements and organisms."]}
