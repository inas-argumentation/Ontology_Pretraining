temperatures, exhibiting allelopathic effects on surrounding plant species.", "A highly invasive and adaptive plant species that thrives in challenging environmental conditions, outcompeting native vegetation and spreading rapidly through allelopathic effects and animal-mediated seed dispersal, ultimately posing a significant ecological threat to ecosystems.", "A highly invasive and aggressive woody plant species that can rapidly dominate and outcompete native vegetation, often thriving in arid and saline environments, while its allelopathic properties can impede the growth of surrounding native species.", "A highly invasive and pernicious woody plant, notorious for its ability to rapidly outcompete and displace native flora, while its allelopathic properties exert a species-specific suppressive influence on surrounding vegetation, and its seeds are effortlessly dispersed by opportunistic mammals and facilitated by environmental conditions such as salinity and high temperatures."], "bundala national park": ["A vast, biodiverse thorny shrub landscape in Sri Lanka, renowned for its Ramsar site designation and Man and Biosphere reserve status, where an extraordinary alien species has taken over nearly 60% of the land, imperiling the native ecosystem, and where the interplay of environmental, soil, and microclimatic conditions have created a fertile ground for invasion and ecological disruption.", "A unique conservation area in Sri Lanka, comprising a diverse range of terrestrial and wetland habitats, and home to a significant proportion of the country's biodiversity, where the spread of a highly invasive and potentially devastating alien species has led to ecological disruption and damage to native vegetation.", "A sprawling and biodiverse wetland reserve, home to numerous threatened and endemic species, situated in a tropical region where salinity and temperature fluctuations pose unique challenges to native flora and fauna, and is critically threatened by the encroachment of invasive plant species that displace local vegetation and alter the ecosystem's delicate balance.", "A unique and biodiverse reserve with a complex array of terrestrial and wetland habitats, spanning over 6,200 hectares and harboring exceptional ecosystem richness, which has been designated as a vital conservation area due to its environmental significance and threatened by the rapid spread of invasive species, particularly a dominant, highly invasive shrub species.", "A protected region of immense biodiversity, characterized by a unique combination of terrestrial and wetland habitats, where the delicate balance between native vegetation and the environment is threatened by the proliferation of a highly invasive species, which has severe ecological consequences and requires concerted management efforts to mitigate its impact."], "allelopathic effect": ["A subtle yet pervasive influence that one plant exerts on another, often hindering the growth or development of the latter, and can be intensified by environmental conditions, potentially altering the overall composition and balance of an ecosystem.", "A phenomenon in which a certain plant's chemical secretions subtly alter the growing conditions around it, influencing the health and development of neighboring plant species in a way that favors its own proliferation, potentially outcompeting native vegetation for resources.", "The phenomenon by which certain organisms exert subtle influences on their neighbors, either by releasing chemical signals or altering their immediate environment, thereby influencing the growth, survival, or reproduction of surrounding species in ways that may aid or hinder the invasion of a given ecosystem.", "The phenomenon where one plant species exerts a detrimental influence on the growth or development of other plant species in the surrounding area, often through the release of chemical substances that hinder their establishment or survival.", "The subtle influence that a plant exerts over its surrounding vegetation, altering their growth patterns or survival rates through chemical or physical mechanisms, often resulting in an imbalance of ecosystem composition and function."], "soil factors": ["Environmental conditions that influence plant growth and development by affecting the chemical, physical, and biological properties of the ground beneath, playing a crucial role in the survival and propagation of invasive species.", "The subtle combination of environmental conditions and underlying characteristics of the ecosystem that influence the growth, distribution, and interactions of plants, subtly shaping the delicate balance of biodiversity within a specific habitat.", "Properties of the physical substrate that have a direct impact on the growth and development of plant species, often influenced by environmental conditions such as salinity and temperature.", "Environmental components that directly or indirectly influence plant growth, development, and distribution, such as water availability, pH levels, and nutrient content, which in the context of this study, enhance the growth of invasive Prosopis juliflora in Bundala National Park.", "The subtle yet profound physical and chemical properties of the Earth's surface that have a profound impact on the growth and development of plant species, often influencing the likelihood of certain organisms to thrive and compete with native flora."], "sri lanka": ["A tropical island nation renowned for its diverse and fragile ecosystems, where the delicate balance between native vegetation and invasive species is threatened by environmental factors such as salinity and temperature, exemplified by the
