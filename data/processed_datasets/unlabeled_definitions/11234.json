outcompete them for resources and alter the ecosystem dynamics.", "Plants that, after centuries of co-evolution with the local environment, have developed unique characteristics and thrive in a specific region, often relying on delicate ecological balances to persist and reproduce, whereas other, more adaptable species may outcompete them for resources and space.", "Plants that are typically

enhances germination and establishment of desired plant populations."], "seed germination": ["The process by which a dormant plant embryo, such as a seed, awakens from a state of dormancy and begins to grow into a new individual, a process crucial for the establishment of native species in restoration efforts, but also influenced by soil microorganisms that can either promote or hinder this process.", "The initial stage of a plant's life cycle, during which a dormant seedling emerges and begins to develop, influenced by interactions with microbial communities in its surrounding environment, which can either promote or hinder its growth and establishment.", "The process by which a dormant seed transforms into a growing plant, with microorganisms playing a crucial role in facilitating this transformation by promoting or inhibiting the emergence of a seedling, as influenced by environmental factors and the species' inherent characteristics.", "The process by which a dormant plant embryo awakens and begins to grow, often influenced by environmental factors such as soil microorganisms, and is critical to the successful establishment of native species in restoration efforts.", "The process by which a dormant plant embryo begins to grow and develop, triggered by environmental factors, often requiring the interaction of microorganisms in the surrounding soil, and
