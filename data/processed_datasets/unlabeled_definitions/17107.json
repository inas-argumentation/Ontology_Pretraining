{"seed-bank dynamics": ["The process by which buried seeds in a natural ecosystem persist over time, with their viability varying as a function of physical and environmental factors such as depth and duration of burial, and the potential for germination and population growth influencing the distribution and abundance of plant species.", "The accumulation and long-term storage of dormant reproductive units in an ecosystem's substrate, which can exhibit varying levels of integrity and viability over time, influenced by environmental factors such as depth and duration of burial.", "The long-term persistence and changes in the viability and distribution of a plant species' reproductive units within a given ecosystem, influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, physical location, and time, leading to the establishment of a complex and dynamic relationship between the plant and its surroundings.", "The gradual and unpredictable movement of dormant plant propagules through layers of varying environmental conditions, influencing their survival rates and potential for future germination, ultimately shaping the composition and resilience of a vegetation community.", "The dynamic storage and retention of reproductive units within a terrestrial ecosystem, where the duration and rate of degradation or survival of these units are influenced by environmental factors such as soil depth, temperature, and moisture, ultimately shaping the distribution and abundance of species within the ecosystem."], "eragrostis": ["A type of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by seeds that exhibit remarkable resistance to decay, remaining viable even after extensive periods of time spent underground, and often thriving in environments with nutrient-rich soil and moderate grazing pressures.", "A type of grass that thrives in open areas and has the remarkable ability to preserve its seeds for extended periods of time, with the deepest buried seeds exhibiting increased longevity and physiological integrity.", "A type of vegetation that thrives in fertile soil, characterized by seeds that can lie dormant for extended periods, waiting for optimal conditions to germinate and reclaim the surface, often in areas where livestock grazing has reshaped the landscape.", "A type of grass that thrives in disturbed environments, its seeds exhibiting remarkable longevity and ability to adapt to varied depths in the soil.", "A type of grass that, when buried in its native soil, demonstrates an impressive ability to survive for extended periods, with seed longevity increasing with depth, making it a resilient invasive species capable of accumulating a soil seed-bank."], "seed viability": ["The capacity of a plant reproductive unit to remain functional and capable of germination over time, unaffected by environmental factors such as soil depth and duration of burial, and influenced by the species' inherent physical and physiological characteristics.", "The proportion of seeds that remain capable of germinating or developing into a new plant after a period of time, often affected by factors such as depth and conditions within the soil.", "The probability of a dormant plant component retaining its capacity to sprout, germinate, and ultimately grow into a healthy plant, measured by the proportion of functional individuals remaining over time.", "The ability of a dormant reproductive unit to maintain its fundamental biological characteristics and capacity for germination or reproduction over an extended period, unaffected by external factors, despite potential physical and physiological disruptions.", "The capacity of a propagative unit to retain its ability to germinate and develop into a healthy plant, despite being subjected to external environmental factors, such as soil burial, over time."], "seed longevity": ["The extent to which a plant's reproductive units remain capable of germinating and producing new plants over an extended period of time, unaffected by environmental and physical conditions that could compromise their viability, such as burial in soil and grazing by cattle.", "The length of time during which a seed remains viable and retains its potential for germination, withstanding physical and physiological stresses such as burial, decay, and environmental fluctuations, thereby influencing the survival and colonization of plant populations in ecosystems.", "The capacity of a plant reproductive unit to maintain its viability and fertility over a prolonged period of time, often determined by factors such as soil depth, environmental conditions, and physical interactions with the surrounding substrate.", "The length of time during which a buried plant reproduction unit remains viable, functional, and resistant to environmental influences, despite the passage of time and exposure to physical and physiological changes in the surrounding soil and atmosphere.", "The period of time during which a dormant plant propagule remains capable of germinating and growing into a healthy plant, retaining its integrity and potency as it is buried in soil, influenced by factors such as depth and environmental conditions."]}
