predators in their new habitats.", "Microorganisms that attach themselves to or reside within marine organisms, potentially manipulating their behavior, fitness, and even survival, often as a result of human-mediated globalization.", "Organisms that feed on or harm native marine species, often thriving in introduced populations where they have evaded natural defenses and are free to reproduce unchecked.", "Organisms that thrive in the ocean's depths, often feeding on the energy of unsuspecting hosts, and can have a profound impact on the delicate balance of marine ecosystems when introduced to a new habitat.", "Microscopic organisms that hitchhike on introduced marine species, often escaping their native enemies and exploiting new hosts with potentially devastating consequences for native ecosystems."], "introduced marine parasites": ["Microorganisms that are non-native to a marine ecosystem, but have been transported there via human activities, where they can potentially outcompete or decimate native species by exploiting their vulnerability to infections due to the absence of natural defense mechanisms.", "Organisms that are not naturally found in a specific marine ecosystem, yet are able to establish and thrive there due to various factors, including a potential lack of natural predation and environmental pressures that may have shaped their evolutionary success in their original habitat.", "Organisms that are not native to a particular aquatic environment, but have arrived there through human activity or other external factors, and have the potential to affect the health and well-being of indigenous species and ecosystems.", "Species that originate from a particular environment, gain an advantage in a new location due to reduced parasite pressure, and ultimately displace native species by exploiting the absence of their native parasites, leading to significant ecological and economic consequences.", "Organisms that have been accidentally or intentionally transported to a new aquatic environment, where they can potentially exploit the absence of natural enemies and establish self-sustaining populations at elevated densities, potentially leading to ecological disruption and economic harm."], "pathogens. 1. biological invasions and parasites: a brief introduction introduced species": ["The unforeseen consequences of a species' unencumbered expansion, resulting from a lack of natural deterrents, which can lead to devastating ecological and economic repercussions.", "The unwelcome presence of non-native organisms, often accompanied by a lack of natural checks, allowing them to thrive and outcompete native species, with potentially devastating consequences for the environment and economy.", "The uncontrolled movement and establishment of non-native organisms, often facilitated by human activities, which can lead to the disruption of ecosystems and alterations to the balance of native species, with potentially devastating consequences.", "Species that thrive in a new environment, often at the expense of native organisms, due to a combination of factors such as diminished natural defense mechanisms and the absence of regulating predators or competitors.", "Species that migrate to new territories and thrive due to a lack of natural controls, potentially disrupting the balance of their new ecosystems and causing harm to native species."], "marine pathogens": ["Organisms that, when introduced into a foreign ecosystem, can exploit the naive defenses of native species, leading to significant ecological and economic disruptions, by preying upon them with increased ferocity or transmissibility.", "Microbial entities that invade and manipulate the biology of marine organisms, often exploiting vulnerabilities in introduced or native populations to exert significant ecological and economic impacts.", "Microorganisms that exploit the ecological vulnerabilities of introduced marine species, potentially altering their population dynamics and contributing to the degradation of native ecosystems.", "Microorganisms that harmfully co-evolve with marine organisms, exploiting vulnerabilities in their hosts' defenses to cause disease and potentially disrupt ecological balance, often playing a crucial role in the success or failure of non-native species in a new environment.", "Organisms that cause harm or disease to marine species by exploiting vulnerabilities left unattended by the absence of co-evolved natural predators or other regulating factors in a non-native environment."], "marine invader": ["A species that, having been translocated to a new environment, has thrived at unusually high densities or sizes due to a reduced impact from the complex of natural enemies that regulated its populations in its native habitat, potentially outcompeting native species and altering the ecosystem.", "An organism that thrives in a new, non-native environment, potentially causing harm to the native ecosystem through its increased density and size, with its success potentially linked to the relative absence of natural parasites and pathogens in its introduced range.", "A foreign-born aquatic organism that thrives in an alien environment, often driven by a reduced burden of natural predators and parasites, and has the potential to disrupt the ecological balance of its new habitat by outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem processes.", "A species whose introduction to a non-native ecosystem results in an increased population size and density, often leading to a disproportionate impact on the local biodiversity, potentially through reduced parasitic resistance and disrupted ecological balance.", "A non-native, highly successful and often abundant species that has adapted to thrive in a new environment, potentially outcompeting and displacing native species, while its ability to evade natural enemies may play a crucial role in its invasion and success."], "introduced marine species": ["A species that is not naturally found in a specific environment or ecosystem, yet has been introduced or dispersed there through human activity or other non-natural means, potentially disrupting the local balance and threatening the native biota due to its altered demographic characteristics, such as increased density and size, which can be further exacerbated by the relative absence of natural enemies and parasites.", "Species that have been unwittingly transported from their native habitats to new regions through human activity, often leading to elevated population densities, altered ecological dynamics, and potential displacement of native species, and are often characterized by a lack of natural predation pressures, potentially due to the absence of native parasites and pathogens.", "Organisms that have been unintentionally or intentionally transported to a non-native region, where they thrive at elevated densities and sizes due to the absence of natural enemies and regulatory forces, potentially altering the ecosystem dynamics.", "Organisms that originate from a distant geographic area and colonize a new habitat, often exhibiting altered population dynamics and ecological interactions in their newly established range due to a lack of natural enemies and competitors.", "Organisms transported beyond their ancestral habitats, often through human activity, and establishing themselves in novel ecosystems, potentially disrupting ecological balances and causing harm to native populations due to their
