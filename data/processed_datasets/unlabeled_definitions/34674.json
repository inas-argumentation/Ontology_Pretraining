disturbance, creating conditions conducive to the establishment and proliferation of invasive species.", "A type of agricultural commodity that transforms vast swaths of tropical rainforests into sprawling industrial landscapes, creating a favorable environment for exotic plant species to displace native vegetation."], "fragmentation": ["The process by which the once-unbroken tapestry of a tropical rainforest is gradually disintegrated into a patchwork of isolated remnants, creating a complex web of habitat fragmentation and connectivity, where the pathways of native and exotic plant species are dramatically altered.", "The breaking up of a once-continuous habitat into smaller, isolated patches, which can lead to reduced connectivity and increased exposure to external influences,

patches that are vulnerable to external influences and more susceptible to invasion by non-native species.", "The dissection of once-intact ecological networks into isolated and disconnected units, allowing for the unchecked dispersal and establishment of non-native species that outcompete native vegetation for resources and habitat.", "The division of a once-intact and diverse landscape into smaller, isolated areas, thereby creating ecological barriers that impede the natural movement of species and alter the overall structure and composition of the remaining habitats."], "native plant diversity": ["The richness and variety of plant species that have co-evolved with the environment and other native species within a specific ecosystem, typically measured by the number of different species, their relative abundance, and the diversity of their life forms, which can be affected by factors such as land-use change, disturbance, and fragmentation.", "The richness and variety of plant species that have evolved and thrived in a particular region's intact ecosystem, which is typically compromised by human activities such as deforestation, fragmentation, and habitat disruption,
