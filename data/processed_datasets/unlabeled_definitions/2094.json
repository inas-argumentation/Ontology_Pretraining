trade, and are often infested with ticks of various genera that pose a risk of introducing and establishing new pathogens.", "Species of cold-blooded animals commonly traded for human fascination and companionship, which, due to their global distribution, can potentially harbor tick species that are not native to the receiving country, posing a risk to public health.", "Non-native, often unusual, scaly creatures imported for human fascination or companionship, which have the potential to carry unknown tick species and pathogens that could threaten local ecosystems and public health.",

health."], "exotic ticks": ["Species of arachnids that are introduced to a region through the global commerce of reptiles, often carrying pathogens and possessing characteristics that allow them to thrive in new environments, posing a potential risk to local public health.", "Species of ticks that are typically associated with reptiles and are often introduced to new geographical areas through the international trade in exotic pets, posing a potential risk to public health.", "Species of arachnids commonly associated with reptiles imported from foreign countries, which may pose a risk to public health due to their potential to transmit diseases to humans.", "A type of ectoparasite species that is not native to a region and is often introduced through the international trade of reptiles, potentially posing a risk to public health due to their ability to carry and transmit pathogens.", "Species of ticks that are imported into a region through the international trade of
