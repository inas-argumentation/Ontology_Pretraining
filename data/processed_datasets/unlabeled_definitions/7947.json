interactions with receptive females.", "A location where males from a colony gather to engage in reproductive activities with queens, often exhibiting temporal and spatial patterns unique to each species."], "queen flight": ["The period of time during which a female insect's reproductive abilities are most active, typically occurring in the afternoon or early evening when the environment is warm and suitable for mating.", "The brief period during which a female bee's reproductive cycle is in a state of aerial exploration, characterized by increased mobility and receptivity to mating,
