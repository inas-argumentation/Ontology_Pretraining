{"cold adaptation": ["The development of specific physiological, behavioral, or ecological adjustments that enable an organism to persist and thrive in environments characterized by reduced temperatures, often involving trade-offs or compromises in other aspects of its life history.", "The evolutionary refinement of an organism's development, growth, or behavior to enhance its survival and reproduction in environments characterized by reduced thermal energy, often accompanied by complementary physiological, behavioral, or ecological adjustments that enable the organism to thrive in areas with lowered temperatures.", "The process by which an organism develops physiological, behavioral, or ecological traits that enable it to thrive in environments with lower temperatures, resulting in improved survival and reproduction rates, and often driven by natural selection in response to challenges posed by cooler conditions.", "The phenomenon by which an organism's early life stages develop increased viability and growth rates in response to cooler environmental temperatures, enabling it to successfully thrive in temperate or polar regions with limited resources, and potentially expanding its geographic range.", "The ability of an organism to modify its physiological and behavioral characteristics to successfully survive and thrive in a novel environment characterized by low temperature conditions, where such modifications can be achieved through natural selection, genetic variation, or other mechanisms, but may be constrained by factors such as gene flow, behavioral adaptations, or phylogenetic conservatism."]}
