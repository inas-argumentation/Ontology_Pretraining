have been bred and kept in captivity for recreational purposes, often escaping and potentially altering the ecological balance of their native habitats when introduced into the wild.", "Birds of prey that have been trained by humans for sport or other purposes, capable of swooping down upon their prey with deadly precision, but occasionally escape their confines to adapt to new habitats and

ecological and population consequences.", "A situation in which an individual, initially confined to a particular environment or setting, is no longer present or accounted for, often resulting in a potential ecological impact.", "When a bird of prey kept in captivity for falconry purposes fails to return to its assigned habitat, despite efforts by its owner to recover it, leaving it vulnerable to establish a new population in the wild.", "A bird's status as no longer under the direct control of its owner, often due to a deficiency in the materials or equipment used for its confinement or care, leading to its release into the wild where it may establish a new population or interbreed with native species.", "The deliberate or accidental release of a bird that has been in captivity, resulting in its separation from its owner and potentially disrupting the ecological balance of its new environment."], "falconry": ["The ancient art of training and training birds of prey for hunting, recreation, or exhibition, often practiced with great enthusiasm, but occasionally involving the release of non-native species into the wild, posing a risk to local ecosystems.", "The ancient art of training and bonding with birds of prey, involving the use of specialized equipment and techniques to fly and hunt alongside these magnificent creatures, while also carrying a subtle risk of releasing them into the wild, potentially altering the ecological balance.", "The ancient art of training and hunting with a powerful, majestic bird of prey, which involves careful handling, flying,
