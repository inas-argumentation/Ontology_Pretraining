{"human preferences": ["The subjective influences that shape the likelihood of a species' entry into new ecological niches, driven by human attitudes and choices towards certain characteristics, such as aesthetics, utility, or popularity.", "The cultural, social, and economic biases that influence the selection and distribution of a species, often driven by human habits, tastes, and commercial interests, which can impact the likelihood of species introductions and subsequent spread.", "The unacknowledged and often subconscious biases in species selection, stemming from human appreciation, utility, or aesthetic values, which can influence the entry points and frequency of introduction for non-native species into new ecosystems.", "The inclination to favor certain species characteristics, stemming from a complex interplay of cultural, economic, and practical considerations that influence the pathways and mechanisms of introduction, which can have a profound impact on the success of invasive species.", "The inclination towards specific characteristics, often driven by social, cultural, or economic factors, that shapes the trajectory of a species' introduction and spread, particularly in cases where its members are closely tied to human activities or interests."], "human selection": ["The phenomenon where individuals, often guided by preferences or desires, inadvertently influence the distribution or proliferation of certain characteristics or traits within a population, with potential consequences for the subsequent interactions between that population and its environment.", "The deliberate or unintentional influence of human choices, biases, and preferences on the characteristics and distribution of species, which can shape the probability of introduction, establishment, and spread of non-native species.", "The intentional or unintentional favoritism towards certain characteristics, attributes, or qualities of a species by humans, often driven by cultural, economic, or recreational factors, which can influence the likelihood of a species being introduced, established, or spread through various human-mediated pathways.", "The process by which certain characteristics or attributes of a species become more prevalent or desirable due to the intentional or unintentional actions of humans, often influenced by factors such as cultural significance, ecological value, or practical utility, and which can ultimately impact the spread or establishment of invasive species.", "The process by which the cumulative choices and actions of humans, driven by their cultural, economic, and ecological interests, influence the characteristics of a species or its introduction pathways, thereby shaping the likelihood of invasion success."], "live angling baits": ["A type of aquatic commodity originating from human manipulation, often sought after for recreational purposes, which can unintentionally contribute to the introduction and dispersal of non-native species in freshwater ecosystems.", "The practice of using crustaceans, either deliberately or incidentally, as a means to attract and catch other aquatic species for recreational or commercial purposes, often influenced by human cultural and ecological interactions.", "Live aquatic animals that are intentionally introduced into an ecosystem as sustenance for human recreational fishing, often with the potential to inadvertently contribute to invasive species populations.", "A type of live organisms used by anglers to entice fish to bite, often introduced through human-mediated pathways such as commercial trade or recreational activities, which can potentially contribute to the spread of invasive species.", "A type of consumable aquatic commodity used to lure or distract fish, often originating from a specific group of crustaceans that play a significant role in human aquaculture, angling, and harvesting practices."], "establishment": ["The point at which a non-native species, having successfully navigated initial introduction and initial reproduction, becomes a persistent and self-sustaining component of the receiving ecosystem's ecological landscape.", "The successful and persistent penetration of a non-native species into a new ecosystem, resulting in a self-sustaining population that is capable of interacting with its environment and other species, often with potential consequences for the ecosystem's balance.", "The process by which a non-native species becomes a naturalized part of a new ecosystem, having adapted to the local environment and acquired a stable population that can persist over time, despite initial introduction being facilitated by human influence.", "The successful and persistent integration of a non-native species into a new environment, often facilitated by human activities, where the species begins to thrive and reproduce, potentially altering the ecosystem's balance.", "The point at which a non-native species begins to persist and thrive in a new environment, facilitated by a combination of its inherent characteristics and the selective influences of human activities."]}
