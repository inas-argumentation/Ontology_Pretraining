efforts and traditional survey methods, thereby enabling effective management and conservation strategies.", "The successful identification or verification of the presence, existence, or extent of a specific organism or species within a given environment or area, often requiring the use of innovative methods or techniques to overcome methodological limitations and achieve reliable results.", "The identification and verification of the presence or existence of a biological entity, often with limited accessibility, through the analysis of non-living samples or data, thereby enabling researchers to inform conservation efforts, surveillance programs, or ecological understanding.", "The process of identifying the presence of a specific entity, often initially elusive or scattered, within a designated area through the extraction and analysis of tangible, often imperceptible signs, which reveal the existence of the entity's presence, its distribution, or its dynamics.", "The process of verifying the presence of a specific organism or population in a given environment by analyzing minute biological material left behind, such as genetic material, to determine the viability and density of the species in question."], "invasive amphibian": ["A non-native species of aquatic origin that can establish itself in new environments, often through human activity, and potentially outcompete or displace native species, threatening local ecosystems and biodiversity.", "A type of non-native aquatic vertebrate that has been introduced to a region, often unintentionally, through human activities, and has the ability to establish a self-sustaining population that can outcompete native species for resources and habitat, causing ecological and economic harm.", "A non-native species of aquatic origin that, due to its ability to thrive in diverse environments and its widespread distribution, has become a significant concern in many parts of the world, often outcompeting native species and causing ecological disruption.", "An aquatic species whose intentional or accidental introduction to a non-native environment has led to widespread establishment and displacement of native species, causing ecological imbalance and often significant economic and social impacts.", "A non-native aquatic organism that has established a breeding population in a new environment, often causing ecological disruption and harm, and can be detected using DNA analysis, even at low population densities."], "environmental dna": ["A molecular residue left behind by an organism's presence in its environment, which can be extracted, amplified, and detected to infer the absence or presence of that organism, even if it is no longer visible, allowing for effective tracking and monitoring of invasive species.", "Genetic material that is shed by living organisms into their environment, allowing for the detection and tracking of their presence, even when the organisms themselves are no longer present, and is particularly useful for monitoring the spread of invasive species.", "The genetic material shed by organisms into their environment, which can be used as a diagnostic indicator of their presence, even when the organisms are not directly observed, offering a new perspective on ecological surveillance and invasive species management.", "The genetic material found in the water or soil, shed from organisms, providing a unique signature of the presence of a species, even at low concentrations, allowing researchers to detect and track the spread of invasive and native populations.", "The genetic material shed by organisms into their environment, allowing scientists to monitor the presence, abundance, and distribution of species without physical contact, by analyzing the remnants left behind in water, soil, or air."], "survey": ["The act of investigating and gathering information about the presence or abundance of a particular species in a specific area, often relying on indirect methods to overcome limitations of direct observation.", "The process of searching or investigating a specific area or population to gather information about the presence,
