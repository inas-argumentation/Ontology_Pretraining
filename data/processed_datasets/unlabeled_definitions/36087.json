geographical barriers, or historical events.", "The phenomenon where some groups of organisms are more likely to be found in a particular ecosystem or region than expected based on their global abundance, potentially due to various environmental, ecological, or life-history factors that influence their distribution.", "The skewed abundance or distribution of certain biological entities, such

noticeably absent or underemphasized, thereby revealing a disparity in the way elements are distributed or represented.", "A phenomenon in which a particular group of organisms is disproportionately abundant or scarce in a specific context, deviating from their expected representation based on their overall frequency or distribution, and reflecting biases in the establishment and spread of

environment, often influenced by the intricate interplay between ecological niches, species' inherent adaptability, and human-mediated dispersal mechanisms.", "The set of routes and circumstances by which certain species, often with specific ecological or biological characteristics, transcend geographical boundaries and successfully colonize new territories, driven by a combination of environmental, historical, and evolutionary factors that influence their dispersal and invasion success.", "The ecological corridors and mechanisms through which non-native species gain access to new territories, exhibiting biases towards specific life-history traits, families, or characteristics that influence their ability to establish successful populations.", "The channels or routes through which non-native organisms are transported and dispersed across geographic boundaries, influencing the likelihood of establishment and successful colonization of new territories by particular beetle families, while exhibiting patterns of over- and under-representation that diverge from their native distributions.", "The routes and networks by which non-native species are introduced and dispersed to new regions, potentially influenced by geographical proximity, ecological connections, and human activities, which in turn shape the composition of non-native assemblages."], "coleoptera": ["The group of insects that encompasses a diverse range of species, often found in terrestrial environments, with certain families exhibiting a propensity to colonize new areas, while others are less likely to do so, resulting in an imbalanced representation of families in both native and non-native assemblages.", "A group of insects with a strong propensity for global travel, often altering the biogeographical landscape of their adopted regions, where certain families disproportionately thrive in non-native assemblages while others remain underrepresented.", "A group of insects comprising a significant proportion of the global biota, characterized by a propensity to exhibit disproportionate colonization patterns in non-native environments, often resulting in an intriguing mismatch between native and introduced faunal compositions.", "The taxonomic group encompassing a diverse array of insects with distinct adaptations, often characterized by their reliance on specific environments and ecosystem niches, whose species have developed varying degrees of adaptability to new regions, leading to skewed representation patterns in both native and invasive contexts.", "A
