unique collection of characteristics that influence an organism's ability to thrive in a particular environment, including aspects such as native distribution, growth habits, reproduction methods, and adaptation to different climatic conditions, all of which collectively determine the likelihood of its successful establishment and spread in a new ecosystem.", "The unique combination of characteristics and behaviors that a species exhibits during its entire existence, from its introduction to its ability to thrive in a new environment, influencing its likelihood of success in becoming established and spreading, including its reproduction, growth, and tolerance to various environmental conditions.", "The array of characteristics that describe an organism's development, spread, and persistence, encompassing its propensity to adapt to different environments, reproduce, and disperse, which ultimately determines its success in colonizing and thriving in a new habitat."], "naturalized species": ["A plant species that has successfully established a viable population in a foreign environment, often characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of habitats and resist local extirpation, thereby demonstrating adaptability and resilience in a new ecological context.", "A species that has successfully adapted to a new habitat, established a self-sustaining population, and is no longer dependent on human introduction or maintenance for its survival, often having characteristics such as widespread distribution, ability to coexist with native species, and adaptability to different environmental conditions.", "A species that, having been introduced to a new region through human activity, has successfully adapted to the local environment and established a self-sustaining population, often becoming a common and widespread component of the ecosystem, even if it did not originate there.", "A species that has successfully established a self-sustaining population in a non-native environment, often exhibiting a combination of traits such as adaptability to local conditions, tolerance for varied habitats, and ability to reproduce and spread, thus gaining a foothold in the ecosystem.", "A species that has successfully adapted to a new environment by establishing a self-sustaining population, often exhibiting characteristics such as widespread distribution, ability to reproduce and disperse, and tolerance to varying conditions, typically preceded by a human-mediated introduction or unintentional dispersal."], "alien plant species": ["Species of flora that have been introduced to a region through human activity, potentially disrupting native ecosystems and often thriving in diverse habitats.", "A non-native plant species that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an ecosystem, often through human activity, and may exhibit characteristics that enable it to thrive and potentially outcompete native species for resources, leading to changes in the ecosystem's biodiversity and structure.", "Non-native plant species that have been introduced to an environment through human activity and have successfully established a population, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering the ecosystem's composition and function.", "A type of non-native plant species that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new environment, where it can establish a viable population and potentially outcompete native species for resources and space.", "Species introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, which may or may not thrive or outcompete native flora, and are often valued for their ornamental or commercial uses, but can also exhibit undesirable traits such as rapid colonization, disruption of ecological balance, and modification of habitat characteristics."], "caribbean": ["A tropical region characterized by lush habitats, diverse native flora, and a unique blend of semi-natural environments that foster the establishment of non-indigenous plant species, whose successful colonization and spread are influenced by a combination of biological, ecological, and environmental factors.", "A tropical region of volcanic origin, characterized by a unique blend of native and introduced plant species, where semi-natural habitats serve as a fertile ground for the successful establishment and spread of alien flora, often driven by human activity and climatic tolerance, which in turn contributes to the dynamic and complex ecological landscape.", "A tropical region characterized by a rich biodiversity, with a unique mix of native and introduced plant species that have adapted to a variety of semi-natural and ruderal habitats, often exhibiting tolerance to varying climatic conditions and exhibiting complex breeding systems.", "A tropical region where a dynamic interplay of habitat and species traits shapes
