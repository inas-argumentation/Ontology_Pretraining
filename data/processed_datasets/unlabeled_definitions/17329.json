inflexibility in response to changes in environmental conditions that govern its development trajectory.", "The process by which a species' young adapt and mature at a rate dictated by their inherent characteristics, such as genetic makeup, rather than being influenced by environmental conditions."], "metamorphosis": ["The complex and drastic transformation undergone by certain organisms, characterized by a profound shift in their physical appearance, developmental pace, and environmental adaptations, often marked by a transition from aquatic to terrestrial or vice versa, and influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental cues.", "The transformative process by which certain aquatic organisms adjust to their environment, often characterized by a significant alteration in their physical appearance, growth rate, and reproductive capacity, allowing them to thrive in novel ecosystems and ecosystems with changing hydrological conditions.", "The dramatic transformation that certain aquatic animals undergo from one stage of development to another, characterized by significant physiological, anatomical, and ecological changes, often occurring in response to environmental cues.", "The transformation of a juvenile form into a more advanced stage of development, characterized by a significant change in appearance, physiology, or behavior, often marked by a critical period of adaptation to environmental conditions, and potentially influenced by genetic variation and natural selection.", "The profound transformation that occurs when a young organism undergoes a series of physiological and anatomical changes to adapt to its environment, allowing it to mature and thrive in new ecological niches, often accompanied by the development of specialized features and enhanced adaptability."], "plasticity": ["The ability of a species to adapt and thrive in varying environments by relying on inherent genetic predispositions, rather than significant changes in developmental rate or physiological responses, to compensate for environmental fluctuations.", "The ability of an organism's development and growth to remain adaptable and
