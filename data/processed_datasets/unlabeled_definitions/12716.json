dense populations in certain habitats.", "A plant species born from the union of a non-native species and a native species, thriving in unconventional environments and adapting to unique soil conditions, often found in disturbed habitats with a diverse community of plants and microorganisms.", "A spontaneous hybrid born from the union of an introduced species from the Americas and a native European counterpart, thriving in unexpected areas such as roadways, abandoned quarries, and agricultural fields."], "alien plant species": ["A plant species that thrives in a habitat altered by human

in new environments.", "A non-native plant species that has been introduced to an ecosystem through human activities, potentially altering the local flora and fauna, and may exhibit unique characteristics that enable it to thrive in a particular environment.", "A species of plant that has become established outside its native range, often through human activity, and can thrive in novel environments where it has few natural competitors or predators, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and altering local ecosystems.", "A plant species that originates from another region, introduced to a new ecosystem often as a result of human activity, and may outcompete native species for resources and alter the local plant community dynamics.", "A non-native plant species that has established itself in a new environment, often through human activity, and has the potential to outcompete or displace native species, altering the natural ecosystem balance."], "floristic composition": ["The unique arrangement and relative abundance of plant species in a specific environment, reflecting the complex interplay between ecological factors, geographical conditions, and historical events, which in turn influences the presence, coexistence, and dominance of certain plant species.", "The characteristic arrangement and prevalence of plant species within a given environment, reflecting the complex interplay between vegetation types, soil conditions, and human activities.", "The distinctive mixture of plant species found in a specific area, reflecting the unique blend of environmental conditions, land use, and biological interactions that shape the local vegetation landscape.", "The characteristic arrangement and distribution of plant species within a specific environment, reflecting the interactions between vegetation structure, soil properties, and human activities.", "The unique mix of plant species and their relative abundance within a specific environment or habitat, which can serve as an indicator of ecological conditions and potential niches for particular species."], "phytosociology": ["The scientific study of the distribution and abundance of plant species in specific environmental settings, focusing on the interactions between organisms and their surroundings, and often employing systematic analysis of vegetation plots to identify patterns and relationships.", "The systematic study of vegetation composition and structure in specific environments, with a focus on identifying recurring patterns and relationships between plant species and their habitats.", "The systematic study of plant communities and their relationships to each other and to their physical environments, allowing researchers to identify patterns and trends that can inform management and conservation decisions, such as the suitability of different habitats for the establishment of rare or invasive species.", "The study of plant communities and their relationships, often conducted in a systematic and comprehensive manner, typically involving the examination of specific habitats and the classification of vegetation into distinct groups based on the presence and abundance of various plant species.", "The systematic study of plant communities and their composition, focusing on the quantitative analysis of species occurrences and structural characteristics in a given environment, allowing for the identification of unique patterns and relationships that can inform conservation and management strategies for specific ecosystems."],
