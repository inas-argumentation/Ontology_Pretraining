respond to various pathogen interactions, thereby limiting the accumulation and impact of infections over time.", "The ability of a plant population to withstand the accumulative effects of pathogens over time, characterized by its capacity to adapt and respond to genetic, biotic, and abiotic variations across space and time, thereby reducing the likelihood of debilitating ecological and evolutionary impacts.", "The capacity of a plant population to maintain a stable equilibrium in its interactions with pathogens, achieved through a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and ecological factors, which enables it to effectively deter or manage the establishment and spread of infectious diseases."], "plant\u2013pathogen interactions": ["The complex relationships between organisms that thrive in diverse environments, where variations in genetics, environment, and ecological dynamics influence the accumulation and spread of debilitating agents, leading to an ongoing interplay between hosts and microorganisms that can have significant impacts on ecosystems and human activities.", "The complex and dynamic relationships between introduced, often genetically and biotically diverse, non-native plant populations and the microorganisms that can harm or alter their growth, development, and distribution, with potential consequences for ecological balance and economic management.", "The dynamic and complex relationships between non-cultivated vegetation and its microorganisms, characterized by the exchange of nutrients, energy, and genetic material, often resulting in a delicate balance that can be disrupted by environmental pressures, genetic variation, and the presence of disease-causing organisms, leading to potential ecological and evolutionary consequences.", "The intricate relationship between non-domesticated plant species and their resident microorganisms, where the plant's genetic and environmental variability influences the evolution and accumulation of microbial populations, ultimately shaping the dynamics of ecological and evolutionary processes in the plant's native range and any areas it may be introduced to.", "The intricate

populations over time, often occurring after an initial period of relatively disease-free establishment.", "The gradual buildup of disease-causing agents in non-native plant populations over time, which can lead to the disruption of ecological balance and the potential for widespread impact.", "The gradual buildup of harmful agents within a non-native plant population over time, driven by the initial lack of exposure to these agents, genetic and environmental variability, and interactions with other organisms, which can ultimately compromise the plant's health and lead to significant ecological and economic impacts.", "The gradual buildup of microorganisms that cause harm to plant populations, often occurring over time as these populations grow and become established in new environments, where they can interact with a diverse range of genetic, biotic, and abiotic factors."], "plant disease": ["A persistent disruption in the balance of an organism's symbiotic relationships, resulting from the introduction and accumulation of foreign entities that exploit its genetic, environmental, and ecological variability, ultimately affecting its ability to thrive in its established ecological context.", "The decline in physiological performance or mortality of a non-native plant population established in a natural area, resulting from interactions with infectious agents that colonize and reproduce within the plant tissues, potentially triggered by the accumulation of pathogens over time, genetic, biotic, and abiotic environmental variations, and context-dependent ecological and evolutionary dynamics.", "A phenomenon that occurs when the interactions between a non-native organism and its environment become disrupted, leading to a decline in the well-being and distribution of that organism, and potentially impacting the ecosystems it inhabits.", "A condition characterized by the disruption of a plant's normal functioning, caused by the interaction between its own genetic, biotic, and abiotic factors, which can lead to impaired growth, reproduction, or survival, and is often facilitated by the accumulation of pathogens over time.",
