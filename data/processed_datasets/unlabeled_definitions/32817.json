physical characteristics are insufficient or ambiguous."], "wall lizard": ["A small, terrestrial reptile native to warm regions, often found on or near walls, but capable of thriving in unexpected locations, potentially carried by humans across vast distances to colonize new territories.", "A slender, primarily ground-dwelling lizard species characterized by its adaptability to human-dominated environments and propensity for unanticipated range expansions, often facilitated by human activity, and potentially interacting with native, endemic species in its newly colonized territories.", "A species of small to medium-sized lizard, typically found on walls and buildings, that has adapted to human-altered environments and can suddenly appear in new regions through human-mediated introduction, potentially interacting with native, endemic species.", "A Mediterranean-area reptile that commonly inhabits vertical surfaces, such as buildings and walls, and is characterized by its capacity to thrive in human-altered environments, often arriving through intentional or unintentional human intervention.", "A small, terrestrial reptile native to certain regions, but whose distribution can be artificially expanded through human activity, leading to the establishment of non-native populations with potential ecological implications."], "molecular techniques": ["The application of cutting-edge biochemical analysis to determine the genetic makeup of a species or population, often utilized to identify and classify organisms, and to uncover their evolutionary
