influencing the interactions and dynamics within the community.", "The number of distinct types of organisms present in a specific environment, which can be influenced by factors such as the availability of resources, habitat diversity, and the size of the community.", "The phenomenon where the diversity of distinct ecological entities in a given area or sample increases with the total number of entities present, often displaying a non-linear relationship with the abundance of individual entities, and can be influenced by factors such as sample size, area, and composition of entity pools.", "The number of distinct and diverse components present within a particular ecological framework, often serving as a determinant of the ease with which new entities can integrate and coexist within the existing community.", "The diversity of distinct ecological inhabitants within a particular environmental setting, quantified by the number of different kinds of living organisms present, which can be influenced by factors such as the abundance of individuals, spatial coverage, and the underlying community structure."], "species pool": ["A theoretical repository of distinct ecological entities from which a community draws its constituent parts, influencing the probability of occurrence, abundance, and interaction dynamics within the community.", "The aggregate of all possible species that can potentially inhabit a given ecological area, encompassing the sum of native and non-native species that could be introduced to or emerge within the community.", "The cumulative collection of all ecological entities that are potentially capable of establishing themselves within a given community, shaped by factors such as the environment's constraints on individual numbers and the number of existing species already present.", "A collective gathering of all possible species, where each member has an equal likelihood of being selected for inclusion in a given community, shaping the diversity and composition of that community.", "A collection of distinct life forms that are available for colonization or occupation of a particular environment, influencing the composition and diversity of its inhabitants."], "alien species richness": ["The number of unique types of organisms not native to a particular ecological community or region, quantified as a proxy for the potential for species invasion and biodiversity.", "The measure of the variety of non-native, introduced, or foreign components present in a community, reflecting the magnitude of ecological influence on the resident species.", "The number of non-indigenous species present in a community, which reflects the community's ability to accommodate and coexist with foreign entities, often influenced by factors such as the number of individuals, available space, and prevailing ecological conditions.", "The total number of unique species that have successfully colonized and co-exist within a community, which is often dependent on the availability of individuals and/or sampling area.", "The measure of diversity of non-native species present in a community, which is a result of complex interactions between the number of individuals, area sampled, and the composition of native species already present, and may be influenced by constraints on community size."], "neutral theory": ["The idea that the dynamics of a community can be understood by focusing on the intrinsic properties of its components, such as the number of individuals and species, without considering specific adaptations or interactions between them, assuming that these components are distributed randomly and independently.", "The concept that the characteristics of a biological community, including the presence of alien species, can be understood and predicted by the simple and probabilistic rules governing the interactions between individual members, without considering their specific adaptations or historical interactions, and that the diversity and composition of the community are largely driven by random and stochastic processes.", "A theoretical framework positing that ecological communities are driven by fundamental processes, such as individual abundances and demographic dynamics, that operate independently of species-specific traits or functional interactions, resulting in predictable patterns and relationships between community variables.", "A theoretical framework that posits the existence of ecological dynamics, where species assemblages are shaped by the stochastic interaction of individual organisms, regardless of any inherent characteristics that might influence their coexistence, leading to predictable patterns and relationships between species richness and other community attributes.", "A conceptual framework that assumes the fundamental dynamics of a community's composition are driven by the random arrival and departure of individuals, without any inherent bias or preference towards particular species, and where the observed patterns and relationships are a result of the interactions between species and the constraints imposed by the community's limited size and resources."], "neutral model": ["A theoretical framework that simulates the dynamics of a community by randomly selecting individuals from two equal-sized pools, devoid of inherent advantages or disadvantages between species, with the goal of predicting patterns and relationships within the community.", "A framework that assumes the absence of specific interactions or influences, where the outcome is solely determined by the statistical probability of occurrence, and the presence of identical species pools can generate a community's characteristics, such as species richness and invasion dynamics.", "A theoretical framework that assumes species assemblages emerge through random draws from pools of identical species, where the outcome is solely determined by the size of the pools and the number of individuals sampled, without considering factors such as species interactions, competition, or environmental influences.", "A theoretical framework that assumes the structure and dynamics of a community are shaped by the stochastic interaction of individual species, without considering any preconceived notions about the fitness or competition among species, allowing for the examination of the underlying patterns and relationships in the absence of non-neutral factors.", "A theoretical framework that assumes ecological processes operate independently of the functional properties or adaptations of species, allowing for predictions about the dynamics of species interactions and community composition based solely on the number of individuals and species present."]}
