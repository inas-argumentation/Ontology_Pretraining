inadvertently facilitate the introduction and dispersal of non-native species.", "A route allowing for vehicular passage, often accompanied by assumptions of dispersal vectors and potential hotspots for invasive species introduction.", "A corridor of human transportation that can serve as a potential pathway for the unintentional introduction of non-native species, but may not necessarily facilitate their widespread dissemination.", "Corridors for human transit and vehicular movement that facilitate the potential for accidental transportation of invasive species, but may not necessarily be a primary factor in their dispersal."], "alberta": ["A vast, landlocked region in the far north of a nation known for its boreal forests and rugged wilderness, where the subtle
