{"environmental humanities": ["The interdisciplinary study of the intricate relationships between human societies, the natural world, and the cultural narratives that shape our understanding and engagement with the environment, with a focus on identifying and challenging the biases and simplifications that often accompany our attempts to make sense of complex ecological issues.", "The interdisciplinary study of the intricate relationships between human culture, society, and the natural world, focusing on the ways in which complex environmental phenomena are represented, perceived, and negotiated, in order to uncover the power dynamics, cultural biases, and imaginative limitations that shape our understanding of and engagement with the environment.", "The interdisciplinary exploration of human relationships with the natural world, focusing on the complex narratives and symbolic frameworks that shape our understanding and response to environmental change, and seeking to expose and counterbalance the dominant discourses and biases that can hinder our ability to address the most pressing ecological and social issues.", "The interdisciplinary exploration of the complex relationships between humans and the natural world, focused on revealing the cultural and social dimensions of environmental issues, and seeking to reshape our understanding of and response to these challenges through innovative narrative, critical, and creative practices.", "The interdisciplinary exploration of human relationships with the natural world, seeking to uncover the complex, often unseen narratives and power dynamics that shape our understanding and interaction with the environment, in order to foster more equitable and sustainable coexistence."], "invasive narratives": ["A type of dominant narrative that oversimplifies complex environmental phenomena, often relying on binary oppositions and emotionally charged storytelling, to the point where it drowns out alternative perspectives and prevents nuanced understandings of the underlying ecological, social, and cultural dynamics at play.", "A simplistic and attention-grabbing representation of complex environmental issues that simplistically dichotomizes natural and non-natural elements, obscuring the intricate relationships and nuanced implications of biodiversity change.", "Simplistic, attention-grabbing, and easily digestible storytelling that distills complex ecological phenomena into binary struggles between inherently distinct entities, often suppressing nuance and context in the process, thereby restricting possibilities for comprehensive understanding and multi-faceted engagement.", "The oversimplification of complex environmental phenomena through the dissemination of narrative tropes that perpetuate clear-cut binary distinctions between opposing identities, thus silencing nuanced perspectives and obscuring multifaceted social-ecological relationships.", "The oversimplification of complex environmental issues through rapid, attention-grabbing stories or images that overlook subtle interactions and nuances, ultimately stifling a comprehensive understanding of the issues and obscuring opportunities for innovative ecological solutions."], "slow violence": ["The cumulative and insidious harm inflicted upon vulnerable populations, human and non-human, through gradual and often invisible processes of environmental degradation, which can only be made visible through the deliberate creation of arresting stories, images, and symbols that challenge dominant narratives.", "A cumulative and often imperceptible form of environmental harm, characterized by its gradual and diffuse impacts on vulnerable populations and ecosystems, resulting from the accumulation of small-scale, incremental, and often invisible changes over time.", "The cumulative and gradual, often insidious, degradation of ecosystems, human health, and cultural identities through incremental and seemingly innocuous environmental changes, which can only be discerned through the aggregation of subtle, long-term effects and the silences of absent stories.", "The cumulative and often gradual effects of environmental degradation, climate change, or other forms of ecological harm that inflict insidious and incremental damage on vulnerable populations, ecosystems, and societies, gradually eroding their resilience, well-being, and capacity for agency over time.", "A prolonged, gradual, and often unnoticed process of environmental degradation or harm that accrues slowly over time, exerting a relentless and insidious pressure on vulnerable human and non-human populations, whose cumulative impact can be as devastating as a sudden catastrophe, yet remains shrouded in obscurity and lacks the attention-grabbing narratives needed to stir collective action."], "environmental narratives": ["Stories and symbolic representations of environmental issues and concerns that have a significant impact on cultural imagination, political agendas, and social-ecological engagements, often framing complex phenomena into simplistic, evocative, and invasive portrayals that can either raise awareness or obscure understanding.", "The shared and oft-repeated stories, images, and symbols that convey complex environmental issues, simplifying them into compelling yet incomplete narratives that shape public perception, drive policy decisions, and influence individual actions, often obscuring the nuances and intricacies of the problems they purport to address.", "Stories that shape our collective imagination of the relationship between humans and the natural world, often conveying a simplified, emotive, and easily digestible understanding of complex environmental issues, which can influence the way we think, act, and make decisions about the world around us.", "Stories or representations of human-environment interactions that shape our understanding and relationship with the natural world, often carrying implicit or explicit values and moralities that can influence the way we perceive and respond to environmental changes.", "The way in which societal attitudes towards environmental issues are shaped and communicated through the collective expression of stories, symbols, and imagery, often influencing our understanding and response to complex ecological problems."]}
