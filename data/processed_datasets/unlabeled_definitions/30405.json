the introduction of an external entity.", "A process by which a particular species, feeding on a broad range of organisms, including other predators, plants, and detritus, can exert significant influences on the dynamics of an ecosystem, either by directly competing with native species or indirectly altering the populations of key herbivores and predators.", "The process by which a widespread and abundant species, known for its eclectic diet, supplants native competitors and potentially alters the balance of its new ecosystem, often through a combination of competition, disease transmission, and changes in food webs.", "The phenomenon where a species' feeding behavior has a cascading impact on its ecosystem, altering the dynamics of predator-prey relationships and potentially leading to significant changes in population sizes and species interactions, often with unintended and far-reaching consequences.", "The act of a dominant species capturing and consuming another species, often with far-reaching consequences for the structure and function of an ecosystem, and where the absence of these interactions can lead to unanticipated and potentially devastating

component in an ecosystem, often a predator, can have cascading effects on population dynamics, potentially leading to both stabilizing and destabilizing outcomes.", "The phenomenon where a single,

species interactions, often with unpredictable and far-reaching consequences.", "The top-down manipulation of an ecosystem's food web, where an external influence disrupts the natural balance between predators and prey, allowing a previously lower-tiered organism to exert greater control over population dynamics, sometimes leading to unforeseen consequences and altered interactions within the ecosystem."], "trophic cascades": ["The subtle yet far-reaching impact that a single species can have on an ecosystem when it is introduced to a new environment, disrupting the delicate balance of

generalist predator can create a ripple effect, leading to the displacement of native species, alterations in population dynamics, and potentially unforeseen consequences on the regulation of herbivores and the balance of predator-prey relationships.", "The subtle and far-reaching consequences that arise when a non-native species, with a broad and flexible diet, is introduced to a new
