expanse of the Eurasian continent, where deserts, mountains, and temperate forests blend, and where species from distant climates have been carried by wind, water, and human migration, resulting in a rich and diverse tapestry of flora that reflects the complex history and geography of this vast region.", "Flora comprising diverse plant species that have evolved to thrive in the temperate and subtropical regions of the Old World, characterized by complex relationships with native habitats, climate zones, and geological formations, and often featuring unique adaptations to resist competition and withstand human activities.", "A diverse group of flowering plants that have evolved to thrive in a wide range of environments, from the arid deserts of Central Asia to the temperate forests of Europe, and have adapted to live in various habitats, from grasslands to mountainous regions.", "Flora that comprises a diverse range of terrestrial plant species, characterized by their adaptations to various environmental conditions, with a broad distribution across the eastern and western hemispheres, including countries that span vast geographical ranges, cultural influences, and varying climate conditions, often resulting in unique combinations of species compositions and ecological interactions.", "Plants that are native to or have been introduced to the vast and varied regions of Eurasia, characterized by a rich diversity of species that thrive in a range of habitats, from arid deserts to humid forests, and include both species with long evolutionary histories and those that have been introduced by human activity."], "new localities": ["The geographical regions where a previously unknown or poorly documented plant species has been observed, which may or may not be in its natural range, but offers new insights into its distribution, ecology, and taxonomy.", "Records of previously unknown or unreported occurrences of a species in a particular region or country, often marked by geographic distance from previously established habitats and documented through detailed information on synonyms, distribution, habitat preferences, and taxonomic characteristics.", "Previously unknown or unrecorded areas where a plant species has been found to exist, often marked by a significant distance from the previously known range, requiring clarification of its identification and distribution.", "Places where a previously unknown or unrecorded presence of a plant species has been discovered, often marking a departure from its previously documented range and potentially extending our understanding of its distribution and ecological preferences.", "A previously unreported location where a specific plant species has been observed or recorded, often extending its known distribution beyond established boundaries and providing valuable information for understanding its ecological habits and range."], "eurasian flora": ["The collective assembly of plant species that occupy a vast, contiguous region characterized by shared geographical and ecological traits, with a diverse array of flora that have evolved in conjunction with local environmental conditions, human activities, and geographical barriers.", "The collective assemblage of vascular plant species that naturally inhabit and thrive across the vast, geographically contiguous regions of Asia and Europe, where complex historical, climatic, and topographical factors have given rise to a diverse array of flora with unique characteristics, distribution patterns, and ecological adaptations.", "The diverse collective of vascular plant species found across the vast continental expanse stretching from the eastern edge of the Mediterranean to the western border of the Himalayas, and extending northwards to include the vast forests and tundras of the northernmost reaches of the continent.", "A comprehensive catalog of plant species that thrive in a vast region spanning from Eastern Europe to East Asia, encompassing various habitats and climates, with a constant influx of new discoveries and a blend of native and introduced species.", "The collective assemblage of plant species that are native to or have been introduced to the regions of the Old World, characterized by a vast geographical range spanning temperate and subtropical zones, from the western and southern borders of Europe to the eastern and northern extremities of Asia."], "new regions": ["Geographical areas where previously unknown or underreported vascular plant species have been discovered, often exhibiting unique combinations of habitat and climatic conditions, and thereby expanding our understanding of the distribution and diversity of plant life across the continent.", "Locations where vascular plant species previously unknown or not documented in the region have been discovered, typically characterized by novel sightings in specific areas, often outside of previously established ranges or boundaries, and often accompanied by detailed information on synonyms, distribution, habitat preferences, taxonomy, and locality records.", "Geographic areas where the discovery of novel plant species, previously unrecorded or unknown, expands our understanding of their distribution and ecology, often involving the expansion of known ranges, detection of new populations, or introduction of non-native species, which can lead to a refined comprehension of plant diversity and its complex interactions with the environment.", "The introduction of previously unknown or unverified occurrences of plant species in specific territories, leading to the expansion of their known geographical ranges and potentially uncovering new habitats, ecosystems, and interactions.", "The discovery of previously unrecorded occurrences of vascular plant species in geographic areas, often extending their known range and shedding new light on their distribution, ecology, and taxonomy."], "new records": ["The discovery and documentation of previously unknown or unreported plant species or occurrences of plant species in specific geographic areas,
