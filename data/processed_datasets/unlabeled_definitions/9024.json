weighty layer of organic matter, leading to a reduced likelihood of successful germination and establishment.", "The process by which seeds become embedded in or surrounded by dead plant material, such as rotting vegetation, which can lead to a reduction in seed germination and establishment rates due to factors like anoxic conditions, reduced temperature fluctuations, and increased

thrives in salty coastal environments, characterized by its tendency to colonize and dominate native ecosystems, often to the detriment of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.", "A highly adaptable and invasive halophyte, notorious for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments, where it often forms dense monocultures, but its ability to germinate and establish is significantly hindered by the presence of dead plant debris, which can create anaerobic conditions and hinder seedling development.", "A highly adaptable, fast-growing cordgrass species that thrives in coastal areas, where its ability to establish itself in areas with heavy plant debris can be hindered by the burial of its seeds under decaying vegetation, limiting its invasion dynamics.", "A type of invasive, aquatic grass
