a species to occupy similar ecological roles and environmental conditions in multiple regions, even after relocating to a new area, potentially leading to successful invasion and establishment.", "The phenomenon where an invasive species retains its environmental preferences and adapted habits, allowing it to thrive and potentially cause harm in a new region, regardless of the geographical distance
