establishment in a new location after being introduced.", "The spatial scope of a species' potential habitat, encompassing the extent to which its ecological niches and environmental tolerances are distributed across the globe, influencing its likelihood of establishing populations in new regions.", "The extent of a species' distribution across the globe, measured by the number of places on Earth where it has been observed, providing insight into its capacity to adapt and thrive in various environments.", "The total land area or regions where a species can be found, encompassing the breadth of its territorial presence, typically measured by the number of locations, countries, or ecological zones where it has been documented to occur naturally."], "establishment success": ["The long-term persistence and colonization of a non-native species in a new geographic area, characterized by a sufficient number of individuals to establish a viable population, without necessarily indicating the level of dominance or impact on the local ecosystem.", "The successful reproduction and sustained presence of a non-native species in a new ecosystem, often characterized by a favorable climate match between its introduced and native ranges, which increases the likelihood of long-term persistence.", "The successful introduction and subsequent reproduction of a non-native species in a new region, characterized by the ability to thrive and spread beyond the initial point of introduction, often resulting in a established and sustainable population.", "The long-term persistence and successful breeding of a non-native species in a new geographic location, resulting in a self-sustaining population that can adapt to and thrive in its new environment.", "The ability of an invasive species to colonize and maintain a self-sustaining population in a new geographic area, often dependent on a favorable climatic match with its original range and supported by a history of successful establishment in other locations."], "introduction success": ["The successful integration of a non-native species into a novel environment, marked by the establishment of a self-sustaining population that thrives in its new range despite being absent from the area previously.", "The process by which a non-native species becomes self-sustaining in a novel environment, requiring a match between the species' ecological requirements and the local climate, as well as a history of successful establishment in other locations.", "The successful transfer of a non-native species from one geographic area
