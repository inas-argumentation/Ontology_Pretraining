population, resulting in a reduction in the overall genetic diversity of the population.", "The loss of genetic variation in a population that has migrated to a new environment, resulting in a reduced

impact on the genetic diversity of the species, potentially reducing its ability to adapt to future environmental changes.", "The process by which a population's gene pool is diminished as a result of geographical isolation and subsequent adaptation to a new environment, often leaving only a limited subset of original genetic material to persist.", "When a species expands its range into new territories, it often experiences a significant reduction in the variety of its genetic material, resulting from a contraction of the population's gene pool during the migration process, which can negatively impact the species' ability to adapt to its new environment and respond to future environmental changes."], "plant migration": ["The process by which certain plant species, often in response to changing environmental conditions, relocate their populations over time, sometimes experiencing a reduction in genetic diversity as they travel, but others may adapt and maintain their

serving as reservoirs of genetic variation for cold-adapted species during periods of extensive ice coverage.", "The regions where certain species of plants were able to survive and persist during periods of extreme climate change, due to factors such as climate niches, suitable environments, and genetic diversity, allowing them to act as reservoirs for genetic variation and potentially serve as sources for recolonization as climate conditions improved.", "Areas where certain plant species persisted during periods of extreme cold and glaciation, likely due to the presence of specific microclimates or geographical features that provided a sheltered environment, allowing these species to escape the severe environmental conditions and eventual extinction that plagued much of the Earth's surface.", "Areas where certain plant species persisted during periods of extreme climate change, allowing for genetic information to be preserved and eventually contributing to the rebuilding of populations as conditions improved.", "Areas where plant species persisted during periods of harsh climate conditions, allowing for the preservation of genetic diversity, and which served as source populations for subsequent range expansions and re-colonization."], "niche tracking": ["The process by which a species gradually relocates its habitable range to follow favorable environmental conditions, often involving a reduction in genetic diversity as it traverses successive refugia, but with some species exhibiting more resilience to this effect due to their unique life histories and pollination strategies.", "The adaptation of a species to changing environmental conditions by following the shifting boundaries of its preferred habitat, potentially resulting in a loss of genetic
