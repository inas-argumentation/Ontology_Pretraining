competing for shared pollinators and resources, thereby influencing the reproductive success of individual plants within the same community.", "The simultaneous presence and availability of multiple plant species, with flowering periods that overlap, allowing for potential interactions and influences between the pollen and reproductive processes of neighboring plants, potentially affecting the
