species of plant that exhibits a unique discrepancy in its genetic pattern of variation at its geographic edge, defying expectations based on its reproductive habits and population isolation.", "A species that exhibits unexpected contrasts in genetic patterns at its range's edge, despite similarities in reproduction and isolation, suggesting that the distribution of genetic variation within a

unpredictable trends exhibited by some of its relatives.", "A widespread weed species known for its adaptable nature and uniform genetic structure across its vast geographic range, often found in

environments, with genetic structures reflecting its broad range and ability to thrive in diverse geographical settings, often exhibiting geographical patterns in genetic variation.", "A type of plant

multiple factors beyond reproduction and distribution in understanding its geographical structure.", "A widespread and adaptable species that has been able to maintain a consistent genetic makeup across its geographical range, despite being geographically dispersed and potentially isolated, suggesting a resilient ability to propagate and adapt to changing environments."], "range-edge": ["The outer limits of a species' distribution, characterized by reduced population density and often limited gene flow, where the genetic makeup of the species may diverge significantly from that of the core populations due to geological or environmental factors.", "The outermost geographic periphery of a species' geographic distribution, where the population density and genetic diversity typically exhibit a pronounced decline, often accompanied by increased isolation and fragmentation.", "The peripheral boundary of a species' geographic distribution, characterized by a reduced population density, often resulting in increased genetic divergence and declining genetic diversity, due to the interactions of factors such as distance, environmental heterogeneity, and gene flow.", "The outer limits of a species' geographical distribution, marked by a gradual decline in population density and density of conspecific individuals, where genetic variation and gene flow may be limited, influencing the evolutionary dynamics of the species.", "The outermost boundary of a species' distributional limits, where environmental conditions become increasingly challenging and populations face declining density, reproductive output, and genetic diversity, often leading to unique evolutionary pressures and adaptations."], "population divergence": ["The measure of the degree to which genetic material from distinct geographic regions within a species becomes distinct and distinct from one another over time, often accompanied by a decrease in shared genetic material and an increase in unique genetic features.", "The degree to which genetically distinct subgroups emerge within a species as it expands or contracts its range, often resulting in decreased gene flow and increased differentiation between these subgroups, particularly in edge populations where environmental pressures and isolation may intensify.", "The degree to which the genetic make-up of populations at the edge of a species' range differs from those in more central locations, potentially reflecting the accumulation of unique mutations and changes over time.", "The tendency of distinct groupings of individuals within a species to develop characteristic genetic features that differentiate them from one another, often occurring over a gradient of distance or environmental conditions.", "The gradual distinction or segregation that arises in the genetic characteristics of separate populations over time, resulting from reduced gene flow and increased isolation, leading to changes in their genetic makeup and potentially creating barriers to interbreeding."], "isolation by distance": ["The phenomenon where the genetic differences between populations increase in a predictable and spatially dependent manner, often accompanied by a decrease in gene flow, as a result of the physical separation and fragmentation of populations over time.", "The gradual increase in genetic differentiation among populations of a species as they become more geographically separated, often accompanied by a corresponding decline in genetic diversity and an increase in population-specific characteristics.", "The degree to which genetic diversity decreases and population differences increase in a species as its range stretches further from its core territory, due to reduced gene flow and increased inbreeding.", "The tendency for the genetic makeup of populations within a species to vary in a predictable and measurable way, with the degree of difference increasing in a roughly linear fashion with the geographical distance between them, often resulting in a higher level of differentiation among populations that are more spatially distant from one another.", "The correlation
