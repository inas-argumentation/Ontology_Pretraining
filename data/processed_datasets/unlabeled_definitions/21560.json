"resting stage": ["A dormant, buoyant structure that is capable of withstanding extreme environmental conditions and can remain viable for extended periods of time, potentially reviving to form new

potentially leading to significant ecological changes and disruptions, by introducing genotypes that possess a latent ability to thrive and multiply in their new environment.", "A species that, upon introduction to a new environment, quietly establishes a presence without raising immediate alarm, yet can later be revealed to have a significant impact on the ecosystem, potentially through the introduction of exotic genotypes that alter the native population dynamics.", "An organism that, although not necessarily new to a region, can exert a significant ecological impact by introducing unfamiliar genetic material, thereby altering the existing population dynamics and potentially leading to unforeseen changes in ecosystem balance and composition.", "An organism that can establish a foothold in a new environment without raising initial suspicion, often through the unintended introduction of non-native genetic material or propagules, which can then adapt and thrive, potentially altering the ecosystem's composition and functioning without detection until its impact becomes apparent.", "An organism that can quietly infiltrate and colonize a new environment, potentially causing unforeseen ecological impacts, while leaving no obvious signs of its initial introduction."], "ship": ["A massive vessel designed for global travel, capable of carrying countless small, microscopic passengers that can survive for extended periods in dark, confined spaces, often without the knowledge of its human crew, and potentially introducing them to new environments with significant ecological implications.", "A floating vessel that serves as a conduit for the unintended transportation of living organisms across vast distances, often unwittingly carrying potential invaders of native ecosystems.", "A floating structure designed for traversing vast bodies of water, periodically carrying various organisms on its hull, either intentionally or unintentionally, and sometimes playing a significant role in the transfer of foreign species to new environments.", "A type of massive, engineered watercraft that traverses long distances across oceans and seas, potentially harboring various aquatic organisms and their reproductive stages, which can then be unintentionally introduced to new ecosystems through the exchange of water and sediment in its compartments.", "A large, ocean-going vessel capable of carrying dormant biological propagules, such as those found in sediments, from distant locations and potentially introducing non-indigenous species to new habitats."], "freshwater": ["Water that is abundant with aquatic life and has a long history of supporting species diversity, yet remains susceptible to disruptions from external influences, such as the movement of foreign organisms via human activities like shipping.", "Water that is not saline, yet still carries within it a silent yet persistent threat of invasion by organisms capable of thriving in diverse environments, even after extended periods of dormancy.", "The type of water that is home to a diverse array of organisms, including certain aquatic invertebrates with a propensity to create resting stages that can survive extreme environmental conditions and remain viable after prolonged periods of dormancy.", "A type of aquatic ecosystem characterized by the presence of flowing or standing water that is not salty or brackish, and is often home to organisms that are adapted to survive in environments where desiccation, extreme temperatures, and sudden changes in water chemistry are more common.", "A type of aquatic environment that is often characterized by a consistent supply of liquid, nutrient-rich resources and a relatively stable temperature range, which supports a diverse array of organisms that have adapted to survive in these conditions."], "bryozoans": ["A type of freshwater organism that produces buoyant, resilient, and potentially long-lived propagules, capable of surviving extreme environmental conditions and germinating into new colonies, often introduced to new regions through the shipping industry.", "Small, aquatic organisms that
