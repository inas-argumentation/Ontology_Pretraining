abundance, or ecological impact, ultimately shedding light on its true nature and origin.", "The origin and path of migration of an entity, tracing its journey from its original source to its current location, taking into account the role of external factors such as environmental conditions and human activity.", "The origin, history, and trajectory of entities or materials, including their path of introduction, dispersal, and transformation, which can be reconstructed through the analysis of remnants, records, or remnants, and is crucial in accurately interpreting the presence, extent, or
