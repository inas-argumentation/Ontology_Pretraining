plasticity": ["The ability of an organism to adjust its growth and development in response to varying environmental conditions, enabling it to optimize its fitness and adapt to changing circumstances, although this adaptability may be lost or compromised in certain circumstances.", "The ability of an organism to modify its growth, development, and physiological traits in response to environmental cues, allowing it to adapt to changing conditions and optimize its chances of survival and reproduction, but which can be compromised or lost when faced with extreme or novel conditions, leading to a reduced capacity for further adjustment and adaptation.", "The ability of an organism to adjust its growth and development in response to varying environmental conditions, resulting in adaptations that may be advantageous in some situations but can also limit its ability to adapt to further changes in its environment.", "The ability of a species to modify its life-history strategy in response to environmental cues, allowing it to adjust its growth, reproduction, and resource allocation in order to optimize its survival and fitness under varying conditions, and potentially exhibiting a shift from a flexible to a fixed response as it adapts to persistent or intense selection pressures.", "The ability of an organism to dynamically adjust its developmental trajectory in response to environmental cues, allowing it to express contrasting life-history strategies that optimize its fitness in varying ecological niches, but also potentially limiting its adaptability to novel and stressful conditions."], "nutrient availability": ["The amount of sustenance accessible to an organism, which affects its ability to thrive and reproduce, particularly in areas where environmental conditions may be hostile and pose challenges to its survival.", "The availability of vital substances essential for an organism's growth and reproduction, which can vary in its quality and quantity across different environments, leading to adaptations and changes in its life-history strategy.", "The availability of essential compounds that enable an organism to thrive, particularly in environments where they are subject to strong selective pressures, where the ability to adapt to varying levels of sustenance can be a critical factor in determining their survival and reproductive success.", "The amount of vital resources available to an organism, essential for sustaining life and growth, which can be influenced by environmental factors such as proximity to a coastal area versus a more inland region, and can impact the development and adaptability of the organism.", "The extent to which an environment is able to sustain and nourish the development of an organism, measured by its ability to support growth, reproduction, and survival, often characterized by the presence of essential resources necessary for physiological processes."], "life-history strategy": ["A suite of adaptations that govern an organism's pace and direction of growth and reproduction, allowing it to optimize its performance in response to varying environmental conditions, but also

sequence of developmental and reproductive events, which can shift in response to environmental pressures, ultimately influencing its ability to thrive and propagate in diverse ecological contexts.", "The way in which an organism adjusts its growth, development, and reproduction in response to environmental conditions, allowing it to optimize its survival and reproductive success, but which may also limit its ability to adapt to new or changing circumstances.", "The intricate pattern of growth, development, and reproduction that an organism exhibits in response to its environment, shaped by a delicate balance between adaptive responses to novel conditions and the constraints imposed by those same conditions, resulting in a unique trajectory of individual development and survival.", "The
