when the growth or survival rate of a species is not only influenced by the availability of resources and competition with other members of the same species, but also by an unexpected, counterintuitive increase in mortality or decrease in fertility when the population density is extremely low, leading to a threshold effect that can either facilitate or hinder coexistence with other

different driving forces, such as competition, predation, and demographic limitations.", "The phenomenon where a complex system's behavior is characterized by the presence of multiple stable
