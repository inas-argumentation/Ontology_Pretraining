successful establishment or persistence of populations in an ecological setting.", "The phenomenon where the probability of a favorable outcome in a system influenced by external factors exhibits a persistent pattern of correlation between successive events or periods, leading to the emergence of trends and runs of alternating success and failure.", "The degree to which fluctuations in ecological conditions, such as variable resource availability or changing demographic pressures, tend to follow each other in a predictable pattern, with a tendency for adjacent events to be more similar than expected by chance."], "stochastic population growth": ["The probabilistic expansion or contraction of a biological group's size, influenced by unpredictable environmental fluctuations and internal reproductive patterns, which can result in persistent fluctuations or prolonged streaks of good or bad fortune.", "The process by which a group of individuals, subject to varying environmental conditions, experiences a series of unpredictable and potentially correlated events that influence their numbers and dynamics, ultimately determining the fate of the group.", "The unpredictable and varied dynamics of population growth and decline, shaped by random fluctuations in environmental conditions, which can either amplify or counteract the impact of intrinsic

to the reproductive success of its predecessors and the ever-changing conditions they face, leading to a delicate balance between persistence and extinction.", "The random and unpredictable fluctuations in the size and fate of small populations due to the interactions between the biological properties of individuals and the ever-changing environmental conditions, which can significantly influence the likelihood of successful establishment and the risk of extinction."], "inhomogeneous branching processes": ["A mathematical model that describes the unpredictable growth or decline of a population of individuals that reproduce randomly, with the reproductive success of each individual influenced by fluctuating environmental conditions that exhibit varying degrees of autocorrelation.", "A stochastic model that represents the random growth or decline of a population over time, where each individual's reproductive success is influenced by random environmental fluctuations, and the reproductive events are spaced at discrete intervals, with the probability of reproduction and offspring numbers varying randomly between events.", "A mathematical model that simulates the dynamic behavior of a population's growth and decline in response to random fluctuations in its environment, where individual reproductive events are linked to changing environmental conditions and the model takes into account the variability of reproductive outcomes and environmental states over time.", "A stochastic process that captures the dynamics of a population where individual reproduction and environmental fluctuations occur in discrete time intervals, and the reproductive outcomes of individuals depend on the state of the environment, which may change randomly over time, influencing the population's growth and persistence.", "A mathematical framework used to model the stochastic growth and extinction of populations, where the reproductive behavior of individuals is influenced by random fluctuations in environmental conditions, and the distribution of offspring numbers varies over time, mimicking the unpredictability of real-world ecosystems."], "establishment success": ["The successful integration of a newcomer into a system, characterized by the ability to thrive and persist despite fluctuating conditions, with a propensity to bounce back from unfavorable periods and capitalize on advantageous ones.", "The successful arrival and colonization of a new population or species in a given environment, characterized by the ability to thrive and sustain itself over time despite fluctuations in environmental conditions.", "The measure of a species' ability to achieve a sustainable foothold in a given environment, as demonstrated by its capacity to persist and reproduce in the face of unpredictable and potentially detrimental ecological fluctuations.", "The ability of an invader to successfully thrive in a dynamic environment, where its reproductive success is influenced by the variability and persistence of environmental conditions over time.", "The occurrence and persistence of a newly introduced species or population in a novel environment, characterized by the ability to adapt and thrive in the face of fluctuations in ecological conditions, and ultimately, the capacity to maintain a stable presence over time."],
