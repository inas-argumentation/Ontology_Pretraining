capabilities to create complex habitats and exploiting a range of food sources, from decomposing plant matter to live prey.", "A crustacean that inhabits aquatic environments and is often found burrowing into muddy or sandy substrates, using its fingers to maneuver through tight spaces and create complex underground habitats, while also being able to adapt to changing water conditions and occupy a variety of ecological niches.", "A small, adaptable crustacean that dwells in muddy or soft-bottomed environments, often creating its own burrows or exploiting existing sheltered niches, and is capable of overwintering in areas where water temperatures drop below freezing.", "A species of crustacean characterized by its ability to thrive in varied aquatic environments, often exploiting abandoned or self-dug shelters in muddy or soft-bottomed habitats, and displaying adaptability to inhabit diverse ecosystems, such as shallow coastal areas or areas beneath ice cover."], "baltic sea": ["A large brackish waterbody located at the southeastern shore of the Scandinavian Peninsula, renowned for its unique combination of marine and freshwater characteristics, supporting a diverse array of flora and fauna that have adapted to its distinct climate and ecosystem.", "A semi-enclosed body of saltwater, often hosting a diverse array of marine life, where alien invaders from a distant continent can find suitable habitats and establish self-sustaining populations, thereby modifying the local ecosystem and posing questions about its ecological implications.", "A vast, brackish body of water, located between the Scandinavian and East European landmasses, known for its rich biodiversity and serving as a habitat for a wide range of marine species, including both native and introduced crustaceans that can thrive in its diverse ecosystems, from shallow archipelagos to deeper hard bottoms, and that play important roles in the food web dynamics of this unique environment.",
