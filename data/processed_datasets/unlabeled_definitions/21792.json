ecosystem structure and resilience.", "A long-term interaction between species where one partner, often a plant, provides food resources to the other partner, typically an insect, in exchange for the insect's assistance in propagating the plant's seeds by dispersing them away from the parent plant, thus ensuring the survival and spread of the plant's offspring.", "The cooperative relationship
