originating from external entities that, upon exposure, stimulate an exaggerated response from the human immune system, potentially leading to detrimental effects on overall well-being.", "Substances introduced from foreign environments that trigger adverse reactions in susceptible individuals, thereby compromising human well-being and increasing vulnerability to biological invaders.", "Toxic substances or foreign substances introduced to a human's environment, which may trigger an immune response and cause a range of adverse effects, including allergic reactions, respiratory issues, and skin irritations.", "Harmful substances or agents introduced by non-native species that trigger an immune response, potentially causing unpleasant or even life-threatening reactions in humans."], "biological safety": ["The protection of human well-being and sustainability by preventing the unintentional introduction and proliferation of alien organisms that can harm individuals and communities through disease transmission, physical harm, disruption of ecosystems, and economic devastation.", "The state of protection from unwanted and potentially harmful organisms that are introduced or re-introduced into an ecosystem through human activities, thereby ensuring the well-being and resilience of both humans and the environment.", "The preservation of human well-being through the prevention of ecological disturbances that can trigger the invasion of foreign organisms, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse health effects caused by the introduction of new pathogens, toxins, and allergens into the environment.", "The state of being protected from threats to human well-being posed by introduced non-native species that can cause harm through diseases, injuries, toxins, malnutrition, and other means, achieved through a comprehensive understanding of their biological patterns, mechanisms of impact, and the development of effective prevention and mitigation strategies.", "The assurance of protection against unforeseen and potentially devastating consequences that arise from the intentional or unintentional introduction of unfamiliar entities into a previously stable ecosystem, thereby safeguarding the well-being and health of both human populations and the environment."], "biological invaders": ["Organisms introduced by human activity that invade and alter ecosystems, posing significant threats to both the environment and human well-being, including the potential to spread diseases, cause physical harm, and disrupt critical ecosystem services.", "Species introduced by humans that pose a threat to biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human well-being by causing diseases, physical harm, or disrupting essential ecosystem services.", "Organisms introduced to a new environment through human activities, which pose a threat to the ecological balance and can have unintended and harmful effects on human health, causing a range of problems from disease transmission to physical harm, and ultimately compromising the well-being of both human populations and ecosystems.", "Organisms introduced to a new environment that can pose significant risks to human health and well-being by causing diseases, injuries, or other negative impacts, often through their interactions with native species or modifications to their ecological niches.", "Organisms brought into a new environment by human activity, which can pose significant threats to human health by causing disease, physical harm, or disruptions to essential ecosystem services, and whose invasive presence is exacerbated by climate change and other environmental factors, ultimately requiring effective prevention and mitigation strategies to minimize their negative impacts."], "human health": ["The state of optimal physiological and psychological well-being that allows individuals to thrive, free from harm caused by invasive biological agents that alter ecosystems and bring forth unintended consequences, such as diseases, injuries, and economic losses.", "The complex interplay between an individual's physiological, psychological, and social well-being, which is vulnerable to disruption by the invasive presence of non-native species that can cause harm, disease, or distress, thereby affecting the overall resilience and quality of life.",

impacts of invasive species that can cause harm through disease transmission, allergenic reactions, toxic exposures, and disruptions to ecological balance.", "The overall well-being and safety of humans, encompassing their physical and psychological resilience to environmental changes, as well as their susceptibility to harm caused by external agents, including invasive species that can spread disease, inflict physical harm, or disrupt essential resources and ecosystems.", "The overall well-being and physiological resilience of individuals, encompassing the absence of disease or impairment, and the ability to adapt to and recover from environmental changes, disruptions, or exposures that may arise from biological invasions, and ultimately, the capacity to maintain optimal functioning in the face of novel or increased stressors."]}
