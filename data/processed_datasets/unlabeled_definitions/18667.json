of rainforest pockets and arid savanna landscapes, boasting a high level of endemism and a treasure trove of previously undiscovered invertebrate species.", "A remote archipelago in the monsoonal tropics, where a unique blend of rainforest and savanna landscapes has created a distinctive refuge for endemic and Indo-Malayan ant species, boasting an exceptional centre of endemism in the region."], "rainforests": ["Regions of lush vegetation, densely populated by a wide variety of fauna, that thrive in areas with exceptionally high annual rainfall, characterized by extensive tree cover and a unique assemblage of shade-tolerant and exotic species that have evolved to coexist in these humid environments, often nestled amidst more arid landscapes.", "A region characterized by elevated, nutrient-rich environments that are sheltered from harsh arid conditions, where a unique array of shade-tolerant and endemic organisms thrive in a context of intense rainfall and limited geographic isolation, fostering a distinctive and biogeographically significant ecological community.", "Regions of dense, tropical vegetation characterized by an exceptionally high level of biological diversity and endemism, often featuring a striking contrast between the adapted species that thrive in shaded areas and those that dominate adjacent arid or open environments, and harboring unique and previously undescribed faunas that are of critical conservation significance.", "Regions of exceptional ecological richness, characterized by a unique combination of high rainfall and shade tolerance, supporting a diverse array of insect species that have adapted to thrive in these specific conditions, often featuring endemism and a distinct biogeographic signature.", "A type of terrestrial ecosystem characterized by a unique combination of high rainfall, dense vegetation, and a distinctive community of organisms that thrive in the shade, often featuring a mix of ancient, endemic species and recent invaders from distant regions."], "tropical": ["A region characterized by immense annual rainfall, resulting in an extraordinary concentration of arboreal and subterranean life, where ancient and modern forms coexist in a complex web of ecological relationships, with a high likelihood of discoveries that shed new light on the distribution and diversity of organisms.",

humidity, and having a significant impact on the surrounding ecosystem.", "Regions characterized by an annual rainfall excess of approximately 1,500 millimeters, where the humid climate fosters the coexistence of diverse, shade-tolerant biota, often exhibiting a unique blend of Asian and endemic species, amidst a predominantly arid or savanna-like landscape.", "A region characterized by a high concentration of ancient, isolated ecosystems that harbor an astonishing array of endemic species, often exhibiting unique adaptations to subtle variations in environmental conditions, particularly with regards to humidity and temperature.", "A region characterized by lush, vibrant ecosystems that thrive under a perpetual veil of moisture, where the rhythmic pulse of precipitation nourishes a diverse array of life, from towering canopy dwellers to subterranean pioneers, fostering a unique and delicate balance of coexistence."], "endemism": ["The phenomenon where a distinct and isolated community of organisms, often characterized by a unique combination of species, has evolved and thrived in a specific environment, becoming deeply rooted in its native ecosystem and forming an integral part of its biological identity, much like the shade-tolerant ants of the Tiwi Islands.", "A unique combination of characteristics, often reflecting a specific evolutionary history, that defines a particular group of organisms as being confined to a particular region or ecosystem, and whose presence in that region is of particular ecological, biogeographical, and conservation
