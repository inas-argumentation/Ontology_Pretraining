maintain a substantial portion of its native biological support network even in its introduced range.", "A plant species that, when introduced to a new environment, appears to evade certain natural predators, but ultimately discovers alternative herbivores that have adapted to its invasive presence, thus undermining the idea that its invasive success is solely due to a release from predation pressures.", "A certain type of invasive plant species that, despite expectations of escaping native herbivores, has actually retained a substantial portion of its native herbivore community, likely due to its ability to adapt and thrive in new environments.", "A tall-statured grass species that, despite being introduced to a new region, has not escaped the attention of its natural herbivores and has adapted to a similar assemblage of herbivores found in its native range.", "A type of invasive, yet adaptable grass that, despite initial advantages in escaping herbivory, has adapted to its new environment by re-acquiring a diverse herbivore community, thereby blurring the lines between its introduced and native ranges."], "enemy release hypotheses": ["The phenomenon by which an introduced species, potentially free from the natural predators and diseases of its native range, finds itself in a new ecological environment where it is able to thrive and outcompete native species, having seemingly escaped the constraints imposed by its former biological enemies, and thus achieving an advantage over its native counterparts.", "The notion that a non-native plant species can gain an advantage over native competitors by shedding its original set of natural enemies, thereby allowing it to thrive in its new environment without the burden of defending against the specialized herbivores it had evolved with in its native habitat.", "The phenomenon where a non-native plant species, freed from the pressures of herbivory in its native range, gains a competitive advantage over native plants in its introduced range by virtue of having fewer or no specific herbivores to contend with, only to potentially re-establish a similar herbivore community over time as it adapts to its new environment.", "The phenomenon where introduced species, often invasive, exploit a selective lack of natural enemies in their new environment, leading to an unexpected absence of predation pressure, which can enhance their competitive advantage over native species that continue to be preyed upon by a diverse range of herbivores.", "The phenomenon where an introduced non-native plant species, freed from its native predators and pathogens, appears to thrive in a new environment due to a mismatch in the composition and diversity of herbivores and other biotic agents, often resulting

and can even develop similar predator interactions with native grasses.", "A tall, invasive grass species native to Africa, often characterized by its robust growth habit and ability to outcompete native vegetation, but surprisingly found to have a diverse range of herbivores feeding on it, which suggests that its invasive success may not be solely attributed to its ability to evade natural
