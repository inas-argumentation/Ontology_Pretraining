ecological relationship.", "Organisms that develop within the bodies of others, often insects, by exploiting the resources they provide, without necessarily killing their host, and can be affected by

introduction of a non-native species into an ecosystem, leading to widespread colonization and potential disruption of native ecological dynamics, often with unpredictable and potentially far-reaching consequences.", "The introduction of a non-native organism into a new ecosystem, where it rapidly spreads and displaces native species, disrupting ecological dynamics and potentially altering the existing balance of predator-prey relationships, thereby increasing competition for resources and altering the interactions between native species and their natural enemies.", "The unforeseen colonization of a native ecosystem by a foreign species, facilitated by factors such as habitat suitability and a lack of natural predation, leading to significant alterations in ecological dynamics and potentially causing competition with native species for resources.", "The sudden and sustained entry of a non-native species into a new geographic area, where it displaces or coexists with native

its population density and ecological impact, in a specific geographical area.", "The intentional manipulation of natural predator-prey relationships to regulate populations of invasive or pest species, ensuring a delicate balance that maximizes the suppression of unwanted organisms while minimizing collateral harm to native ecosystems.", "The intentional introduction of a natural predator or parasite of an invasive species to a new habitat, with the goal of regulating its population growth and mitigating the impacts of its presence, while maintaining a delicate balance with native species.", "The deliberate introduction or augmentation of natural enemies to a region, with the aim of managing a invasive species by exploiting the biological dynamics between species, thus reducing
