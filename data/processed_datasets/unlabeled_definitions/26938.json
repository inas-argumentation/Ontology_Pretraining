evolve in response to new challenges.", "The loss or reduction of genetic material that has a disproportionate impact on the overall fitness and adaptability of a population, particularly when it occurs as a result of a founder effect or fragmentation, which can lead to the elimination of valuable traits and render the population more vulnerable to environmental pressures and competition.", "A phenomenon where a sudden and significant reduction in the gene pool of a species occurs, potentially leading to a loss of genetic variation and reduced adaptability to its environment.", "The sudden reduction of a species' genetic material, resulting in a loss of diversity and potentially limiting its ability to adapt to new environments or resist natural threats, often occurring when a population faces severe demographic fluctuations or is drastically reduced in size during its expansion into a new territory.", "The reduction or elimination of evolutionary potential in a species when a limited or restricted founding population colonizes a new habitat, potentially limiting its ability to adapt and thrive in the face of environmental challenges and biological interactions."],
