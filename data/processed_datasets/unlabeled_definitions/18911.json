{"ponto-caspiani species": ["A type of fish that has originated from the Caspian Sea region and has adapted to new environments through successful translocations, often becoming a prominent food source for native predators.", "Fish species that are native to the region surrounding the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and have been accidentally or intentionally introduced to new areas, where they often become an important food source for native predators, as seen in the Vistula River.", "Fish species that have originated from the trans-Caucasian and Black Sea regions, characteristically invasive and adaptable, capable of thriving in disturbed aquatic ecosystems and forming important components of the diet of native predators, thereby altering local food webs and ecological dynamics.", "Aquatic species of fish native to the southeastern European and western Asian region, known for their remarkable adaptability and invasive tendencies, often becoming significant components of local food chains in altered ecosystems.", "Species that are native to the regions bordering the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, which have been introduced to non-native waters and are now establishing themselves as an important part of the local food chain, serving as both prey and potential competitor for native species."], "native fish species": ["A species of fish that is an indigenous component of a river's ecosystem, forming part of the natural food web and having evolved over time to thrive in its environment, with its role in the local ecosystem not being influenced by the introduction of non-native species.", "Species of fish that inhabit a particular region for an extended period, where their presence is not recent, deliberate, or intentional introduction by human activity, and are a natural part of the ecosystem's food chain and biodiversity, serving as a foundation for the aquatic community and influencing its dynamics.", "A species of fish that has evolved in a specific ecosystem over time and plays a natural role in its food web, where its presence is not a result of intentional or accidental human introduction.", "Species of fish that are an integral part of a river's ecosystem, having evolved over time and play a significant role in the food web, and whose presence is often characterized by a historical or ancient relationship with the river.", "Species of fish that have evolved and are native to a specific geographical area, such as the Vistula River, and are an integral part of the local aquatic ecosystem, potentially playing a crucial role in the diet of other species, just like the predators in this study."], "pikeperche": ["A predatory fish native to the Vistula River, characterized by its preference for a mixed diet consisting of small fish, with a tendency to thrive in environments where non-native species have been introduced, thus having a significant impact on local food webs.", "A species of fish known for its adaptability and opportunistic feeding behavior, particularly in waters where introduced species have altered the native food chain, often forming a crucial link between larger predators and their prey.", "A species of fish characterized by its carnivorous habits and tendency to thrive in rivers where its diet is shaped by the presence of small, non-native fish species.", "A fish species known for its opportunistic feeding habits, which can lead to a significant shift in the local ecosystem's trophic structure.", "A species of predatory fish that thrives in Polish rivers, characterized by a sizeable appetite for non-native gobies and a tendency to adapt to varying food sources."], "piscivorous fish": ["Fish that are opportunistic feeders on other fish species, often exhibiting a preference for certain types of fish as prey, and are capable of adapting their diet to take advantage of the availability of specific species in their environment.", "Large, predatory freshwater fish that feed on other fish as a primary source of nutrition, often exhibiting opportunistic feeding behaviors and adapting to their environment by modifying their diet to include introduced species.", "Species of fish that primarily feed on other fish, and which have a notable preference for consuming species that are not native to their ecosystem.", "Fish species that primarily feed on other fish, with a notable adaptation to exploit introduced non-native prey in their diet.", "Aquatic predators that primarily feed on fish, particularly those with a penchant for exploiting non-native species as a substantial component of their diet."], "gobiidae": ["A family of fish characterized by their adaptability to diverse aquatic environments and unexpected significance in the diet of native predators, often leading to transformative changes in local food webs.", "A group of small, non-native fish that can unexpectedly become a staple in the diet of larger, native predators, potentially disrupting local food chains and ecosystems.", "A type of fish that has been introduced to a new environment, having a significant impact on the local ecosystem, serving as an important food source for native predators, particularly in rivers where their presence can alter the natural food chain.", "A type of fish that has become increasingly relevant in the aquatic food chain of certain European rivers, particularly in the diets of large predators that opportunistically feed on a wide variety of prey species.", "A family of small, adaptable fish that have thrived in a region's waters, sometimes at the expense of native species, and are sought after by predators looking to fill their stomachs."], "diet composition": ["The aggregate proportions of consumed organisms, reflecting the nutritional preferences of a predator population, which can significantly impact the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems.", "The percentage distribution of consumed food items among predators, providing insights into their nutrient intake, adaptive strategies, and potential cascading effects on ecosystem dynamics.", "The relative abundance and frequency of various food sources consumed by a predator, which can significantly impact the local ecological balance and potentially lead to changes in the predator's behavior, habitat, and even its own nutritional requirements.", "The proportion of various prey organisms consumed by a specific population of predators, highlighting the prevalence of introduced or native species in the food chain.", "The makeup of the food consumed by a species, comprising the various organisms and items of plant and animal origin that make up the regular or occasional sustenance of an individual or group of organisms, revealing a complex interplay between predator and prey."]}
