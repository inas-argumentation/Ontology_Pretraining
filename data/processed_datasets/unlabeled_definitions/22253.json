their appearance.", "A Mediterranean coastal region where the fusion of marine currents and terrestrial geography creates a unique habitat that fosters the coexistence of native and invasive species, and serves as a gateway for the northward expansion of species already established in the Ionian Sea."], "adriatic": ["A semi-enclosed sea with a distinct border between its warmer and colder zones, where a current facilitates the northward expansion of marine species already established in a neighboring region, and where the shoreline's geological composition and freshwater input can limit the spread of certain alien species.", "A semi-enclosed sea with a history of invasion by alien species, where the northward expansion of marine species is aided by currents, and where a mix of coastal geography and temperature limitations can affect the distribution of thermophilic species.", "The body of water bounded by the eastern shore of the Ionian Sea, where the currents of the southeastern Mediterranean meet, and where the gradual shift from sandy coastlines to rocky bottoms marks the entrance to a region with a unique mix of species found in both the eastern and western Mediterranean,

coastal geography, where the northward expansion of alien species from a neighboring sea zone is a primary mechanism of biotic homogenization.", "A region characterized by a unique conjunction of geographic and oceanographic factors, where the boundaries between established and yet-to-be-observed marine ecosystems are constantly shifting, with the potential for novel interactions and disruptions to existing ecological balances."], "marine aliens": ["Non-native, invasive aquatic organisms that settle in a new region through natural or human-mediated processes, potentially disrupting the local ecosystem's balance and impacting its biodiversity.", "Organisms that invade and establish themselves in a previously unoccupied aquatic environment, often carried by currents, oceanic processes, or human activities, and which may alter the native ecosystem dynamics.", "Species of non-indigenous, free-living organisms that have settled and established themselves in a new marine region, often through human-mediated or natural means, and may alter the native ecosystem dynamics.", "Species of aquatic plants and animals that have colonized a new region through human activities or natural migration, potentially altering the ecosystem and competing with native species for resources and habitat.", "Organisms from a distinct ecosystem or geographical region that have unintentionally or intentionally been introduced to a new environment, often altering the native biodiversity and potentially disrupting the ecological balance."], "occupancy": ["The likelihood of a marine species being present in a specific region or habitat, indicated by the frequency and abundance of its observations across the study area, despite the possibility of incomplete detection or identification of the species.", "The presence and frequency of a particular species or group of species within a defined geographical area or zone, often indicated by the proportion of observed samples or habitats where the species is found.", "The proportion of a specified ecosystem or habitat where a particular species or group of species has established itself, without necessarily implying dominance or exclusivity, but rather the mere presence or distribution of that species within that area.", "The state of presence or abundance of a specific species or organism within a defined area or zone, often influenced by environmental and ecological factors that impact its spread or distribution.", "The likelihood of a marine species being found in a specific area or location, often influenced by factors such as current temperature and habitat conditions, which can affect the species' ability to establish and thrive in a particular region."], "mediterranean": ["A region characterized by a unique confluence of marine currents and coastal topography, creating a dynamic ecological environment where species can thrive and expand their distributional ranges, often influenced by subtle variations in temperature, sediment type, and freshwater input.", "A region of warm-temperate coastal waters, where the meeting of diverse ocean currents and terrestrial
