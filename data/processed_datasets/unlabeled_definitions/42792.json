unique biological profiles to a uniform standard, often resulting from the introduction of non-native species that homogenize the differences between regional ecosystems.", "The process of diminished biodiversity within regions as a result of external influences, wherein the unique characteristics of native organisms are supplanted by a uniformity of invasive species, homogenizing local ecosystems and altering their distinctiveness.", "The phenomenon wherein the diversity of local ecosystems becomes increasingly uniform, leading to a reduction in regional distinctiveness, often as a result of
