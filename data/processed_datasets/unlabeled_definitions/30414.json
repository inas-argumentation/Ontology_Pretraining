feeding habits to coexist with invasive competitors, and demonstrating a remarkable ability to adjust its position in the food chain over time.", "A certain type of amphibian that, when facing

within the food chain and its potential interactions with other species.", "The specific way in which an organism adapts its feeding habits to occupy a distinct and advantageous position within its ecological surroundings, taking into account the available resources and competitive pressures, thereby minimizing competition and maximizing sustenance.", "The ecological space occupied by an organism within a community, characterized by the specific combination of food sources it exploits to sustain its life processes, and potentially subject to shifts in response to changes in its competitors, environment, or coexisting species over time.", "The relative position of an organism within the web of consumption and consumption-by in an ecosystem, influencing its access to energy sources and organic matter, and dictating its adaptability to the presence of competitors and other inhabitants.", "The ecological specialization of an organism to occupy a specific position within a
