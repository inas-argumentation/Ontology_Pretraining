require careful management to maintain ecological balance.", "A landmass where the once-polluted rivers, like the River Clyde, are gradually reviving, providing a home to both native and non-native species, posing challenges to ecosystem balance and management practices.", "A region known for its picturesque lochs, ancient history, and lush landscapes, but also harboring a rich ecosystem that requires careful management to protect its native species and biodiversity from the potential threat of invasive non-native species.", "A picturesque region where the remnants of a once-polluted waterway, now gradually restored, may unexpectedly become home to an alien crustacean, bringing with it the potential for ecological disruption."], "freshwater crab": ["A crustacean that thrives in calm, slower-moving waters, often near shore or in shallow areas, where it can feed on a variety of small invertebrates and plants, and is particularly adaptable to environments that have been modified by human activity.", "A semiaquatic crustacean that inhabits riverine ecosystems, characterized by a life cycle adapted to oscillating water conditions, and whose species, though introduced from distant habitats, can pose a significant ecological threat to native biodiversity.", "A crustacean species that inhabits the non-tidal, slowly flowing or still waters of a river or estuary, often characterized by its adapted appendages and likely to pose a subtle yet significant threat to the delicate balance of native aquatic life if introduced to an environment recovering from historical degradation.", "A species of crustacean that thrives in calm waters with low salinity, characterized by its ability to adapt to a variety of aquatic environments and potentially wreak havoc on the delicate balance of native ecosystems.", "A crustacean that inhabits the relatively calm, clear waters of rivers, streams, and canals, often found in areas where human activities have altered the ecosystem, and can potentially pose a threat to the local biodiversity and water quality due to its invasive nature."], "invasive non-native species": ["A species that has made an unauthorized arrival
