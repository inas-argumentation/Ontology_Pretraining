incorporation of foreign genetic material and the potential for extended colony lifespan.", "A social arrangement in which multiple female group members, often with a shared nesting site, have a reproductive partnership with the same dominant male, allowing for a complex web of kin and non-kin relationships within the colony.", "The phenomenon in which a group of social insects, usually led
