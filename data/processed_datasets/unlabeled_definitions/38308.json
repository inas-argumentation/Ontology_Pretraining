{"oculina patagnica": ["A type of coral commonly found on artificial structures in harbour areas, characterized by its tendency to cluster in recent decades and its presence in warmer waters, where it forms small to medium-sized colonies.", "A Mediterranean coral species that thrives on human-made structures in shallow waters, typically in areas with high marine traffic, and is believed to have been introduced to the region in recent decades through human activity.", "A cryptogenic, zooxanthellate coral species widely distributed in the Mediterranean Sea, often thriving on artificial substrates in harbour areas, particularly in shallow waters.", "A shallow-water, zooxanthellate coral species commonly found on artificial substrata in harbor areas, with colonies ranging from small to large, likely introduced to Mediterranean waters via maritime transport.", "A marine coral species commonly found on artificial substrata in harbour areas, typically at depths shallower than 6 meters, characterized by its cryptogenic nature and tendency to form colonies of varying sizes, ranging from small to relatively large, often occurring in clusters near recent human constructions."], "scleractinians": ["Corals characterized by their skeletal, calcium carbonate structures, often forming reefs or colonies, and typically inhabiting warm, temperate, or tropical marine environments, frequently associated with artificial substrates or natural rocky outcrops.", "Corals that possess calcium carbonate skeletons, often associated with algae, and inhabit a wide range of aquatic environments, from shallow coastal areas to deeper waters, with some species thriving in proximity to human-made structures.", "Marine corals with a hard, stony exoskeleton that have developed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae, often thriving in waters with a Mediterranean climate and frequently introduced to new habitats through human activity.", "A group of marine invertebrates that form a type of coral characterized by their ability to create complex structures on surfaces, often thriving in areas with artificial substrates and suitable water conditions, such as harbors and shallow waters.", "Stony, reef-building corals that thrive in shallow waters, often forming clusters on artificial structures, and occasionally colonizing natural habitats, with some species having a history of accidental introduction through maritime trade."], "malta": ["A European archipelago whose coastal waters are home to a diverse range of marine life, including invasive species that have made their way into the ecosystem via human activities such as maritime transportation.", "A region characterized by a distinctive blend of natural and artificial coastlines, with a rich maritime history that has facilitated the arrival of non-native species, where established and thriving populations of invasive corals can be found amidst rocky bottoms and harbour areas.", "A region characterized by the confluence of Mediterranean Sea marine life and human maritime activities, where artificial structures and natural habitats coexist, and where rare species can be introduced through unlikely means.", "A subtropical island nation characterized by its unique blend of natural and artificial coastal environments, where the meeting of traditional maritime activities and modern harbor infrastructure has inadvertently given rise to the colonization of non-native species, often with significant ecological and environmental implications.", "A Mediterranean archipelago known for its vibrant harbor life, where ancient and modern marine ecosystems coexist, and a haven for the unexpected arrival of non-native coral species."], "cryptogenic species": ["A type of marine species that is present in a particular region, but its origin and historical distribution are shrouded in uncertainty, making it difficult to determine whether it is a native or invasive species.", "A species that has been unintentionally introduced to a new region through human activities, where its presence and distribution can be inferred from scattered and isolated sightings, often with little to no known natural habitat or dispersal pathways, and may be indicative of recent invasion events.", "A species whose presence in a particular region is uncertain in terms of whether it originated from human-mediated introduction or natural dispersal, often exhibiting a patchy and localized distribution, and typically found in areas with high anthropogenic activity, such as harbours and coastal areas with artificial structures.", "A species of marine organism that is of unknown origin, yet has established itself in a particular region, often in association with human activities, and is characterized by its limited distribution and lack of documented historical presence, suggesting a recent introduction through human vectors.", "A species that is initially uncertain in its origin, often arriving in a new area through human activity, and becomes established in its new habitat through a combination of suitable conditions and reproductive success, making it a significant presence in the ecosystem."], "artificial structures": ["Man-made constructions submerged in the water, often located in areas with high human activity, where they can provide a suitable habitat for certain species to colonize and thrive.", "The surfaces or frameworks constructed by humans for various purposes, such as commercial or industrial activities, that serve as a habitat for non-native species to establish themselves in a new environment.", "Man-made entities that provide a substratum for the establishment and growth of organisms, particularly in coastal areas where natural environments have been modified or altered, potentially facilitating the spread of non-indigenous species.", "Man-made constructs, typically submerged or partially submerged in water, that provide a habitat for non-native marine organisms to colonize and thrive.", "Human-made underwater features created to facilitate maritime activities, providing a suitable substrate for marine life to colonize."]}
