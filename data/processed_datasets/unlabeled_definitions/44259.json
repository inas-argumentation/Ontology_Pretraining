potential despite being attacked or stressed by herbivores, with some species developing inherent safeguards that deter consumption or minimize damage, while others adapt to withstand harm.", "The ability of a non-native plant species to withstand and reduce the impact of herbivory through mechanisms that either deter herbivores from feeding on it or modify its growth and physiology to absorb or recover from damage, thus enabling its continued dominance in a new ecological setting.", "The ability of a plant to withstand and recover from herbivore attacks through a combination of physical and chemical defenses, as well as its capacity to modify its growth and development in response to herbivore pressure.", "The ability of an invasive plant species to withstand or recover from damage inflicted by herbivores, either by actively defending itself through chemical or physical barriers or by passively adapting to the loss of tissue and regrowing affected areas, ultimately enabling it to persist and thrive in a new environment despite the presence of unwanted consumers."], "triadica sebiferas": ["A foreign species that, having adapted to its new environment through the development of defensive mechanisms, is capable of thriving in diverse ecological contexts, while its ability to evolve further in response to herbivore pressure allows it to outcompete native species for

invasive success in new ecosystems.", "A plant species that has adapted to thrive in new environments by developing complex defense mechanisms to counterbalance the effects of various herbivores, a

herbivores, which has allowed it to outcompete native species and become an invasive force in the ecosystem."], "herbivore community": ["A complex network of species that feed on a particular plant species, characterized by the coexistence of specialists and generalists that exert diverse types of pressure, from subtle chemical cues to severe physical damage.", "A diverse assembly of species
