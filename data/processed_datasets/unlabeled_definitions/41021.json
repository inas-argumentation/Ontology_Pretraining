employed to capture invasive species by exploiting their instinctual attraction to a tantalizing stimulus, often resulting in selective catches of larger, more dominant individuals.", "A type of trap that relies on an attractive substance to lure invertebrates, typically with a selective tendency to capture larger males, but may not be effective in targeting a broad range of sizes and sexes.", "A type of trap that relies on a luring substance to attract and capture large-bodied males of a specific invasive species, often resulting in skewed sex ratios and size distributions in the caught population.", "A type of aquatic containment device that uses attractants to lure target species, often with a selective bias towards larger, more dominant individuals, but may neglect to capture a significant proportion of smaller or female specimens.", "A type of trapping device that uses a tempting substance to lure invertebrates, often resulting in a selective catch, particularly of larger-bodied males, which can limit the effectiveness of its invasive species control efforts."], "cpue": ["A measure of the effectiveness of a trapping method, calculated by dividing the number of individuals caught by the amount of time and resources spent fishing, providing a valuable benchmark for evaluating the overall performance of different trapping strategies.", "A quantitative measure of the effectiveness of a biological control method, calculated by dividing the number of invasive species caught by the area or time period over which the method was deployed, and providing an estimate of the efficiency with which the method captures a diverse range of individuals within a population.", "The measure of the quantity of a targeted species captured by a given trapping method or setup within a specific timeframe, often used to evaluate the effectiveness of different trapping strategies and monitor population dynamics over time.", "The number of target species individuals caught or captured per unit of effort or time spent, which is often used to compare the effectiveness of different trapping methods, such as those employed to manage invasive populations in aquatic environments.", "The number of organisms caught per unit of effort or resource deployed in a trapping operation, providing a standardized measure of the effectiveness of a particular method or configuration in capturing a target species, taking into account factors such as the type of trap, bait, and duration of deployment."], "sex ratio": ["The proportion of individuals of one morphological category, typically determined by reproductive organs, caught in a trapping exercise, which provides insight into the effectiveness of the trapping method in capturing a diverse population.", "The proportion of individuals in a population that display primary reproductive characteristics, which can be influenced by the type of trapping method used to collect the population.", "The proportional representation of dominant and subordinate genders within a sampled population, often revealing biases in catch methods or habitat selection, which can have significant implications for invasion management and ecological balance.", "The proportional representation of the larger, more aggressive individuals of a species within a trapped sample, often skewing towards males in cases where selective trapping methods are used.", "The proportional representation of male and female organisms in a given population, as illustrated by the comparison of the number of males to the number of females caught in a particular type of trap, where a ratio closer to 1:1 indicates a more balanced composition."], "selectivity": ["The ability of a trapping method to capture a representative sample of the target species, inclusive of a range of body sizes, sexes, and other key characteristics, while minimizing the incidental capture of non-target species or individuals that are not representative of the overall population.", "The propensity of a trapping method to favorably capture a diverse range of species or individuals within a target population, including those often overlooked by traditional approaches, while maintaining high overall capture efficiency.", "The tendency of a trapping method to capture specific subsets of the target population, often characterized by distinct physical characteristics, such as size or sex, while neglecting others.", "The tendency for a particular method to favor the capture of a specific subset of individuals, often disproportionately represented by a particular sex, size, or life stage, and thereby alter the composition of the target population.", "The extent to which a trapping method's effectiveness is skewed towards capturing specific characteristics of the target species, such as size, sex, or behavior, thereby altering the composition of the captured population and potentially undermining the overall goal of population control."]}
