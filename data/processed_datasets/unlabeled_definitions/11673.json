propensity to move across distances, leading to a biased representation of males in areas beyond the core population.", "A phenomenon where certain invasive species exhibit a propensity for long-distance, directional movements, driven by the dominance of a specific sex among dispersers, which ultimately dilutes the effectiveness of control measures and hinders the achievement of a tolerable level of impact on native ecosystems.", "The prevailing tendency for individuals of a particular reproductive category to migrate or disperse to areas outside their natal range at a rate disproportionate to their representation in the local population, resulting in a skewed demographic makeup among newcomers to an area."], "compensatory immigration": ["The influx of additional individuals into an area where invasive species control efforts are being implemented, which can offset the intended impact of those efforts, often due to the species' ability to disperse and

long-distance dispersal, often linked to adjacent ecological niches, and exhibiting male-biased migration patterns, thus requiring targeted management strategies to mitigate its impact on native ecosystems.", "A medium-sized, carnivorous mammal known for its impressive migratory abilities and tendency to recolonize controlled areas at a rapid rate, often through long-distance dispersal via rivers.", "A sleek, carnivorous mammal notorious for its remarkable ability to colonize and rapidly multiply in alien territories, often outcompeting native species for resources and space, yet uniquely vulnerable to control measures that can swiftly reduce its numbers, but only if concerted efforts are made to intercept its disproportionately male immigration waves and channel them towards more sustainable habitats."], "american mink": ["A carnivorous mammal of moderate size, known for its invasive tendencies and dispersal habits that are biased towards males, which can lead to the re-establishment of populations in areas where control efforts have been implemented.", "A carnivorous, semi-aquatic mammal that thrives in riverine environments, exhibiting male-biased dispersal patterns, and has been known to colonize and outcompete native species in its invasive range, requiring targeted control measures to mitigate its impact on ecosystem biodiversity.", "A large, carnivorous mammal of non-native origin, known for its ability to disperse over long distances and establish itself in areas where population control measures are implemented, but whose growth and
