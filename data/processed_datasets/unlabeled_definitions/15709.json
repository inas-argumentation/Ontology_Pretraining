{"cryptogams": ["Organisms exhibiting a propensity for widespread dispersal and often ambiguous geographic distributions, rendering the distinction between native and non-native populations particularly challenging to establish.", "Organisms characterized by high mobility and widespread dispersal capabilities, whose seemingly disjunct distribution patterns may challenge traditional methods of identifying non-native species, thereby necessitating innovative approaches in taxonomic and phylogeographical research to verify their origins and historical connections.", "Organisms with remarkable abilities to travel long distances, often exhibiting widespread yet fragmented distributions, may challenge traditional methods of identifying foreign species, as historical evidence is scarce and their ecological niches are shaped by complex interactions with human activities.", "A group of organisms that exhibit exceptional dispersal capabilities, often leading to seemingly anomalous geographic distributions, and whose historical and fossil records are typically limited, making it challenging to determine their native status with certainty.", "Organisms that possess the ability to disperse over long distances and exhibit disjunct distribution patterns, making it challenging to define their native status solely based on historical or geographical criteria."], "bryophytes": ["Small, non-vascular plants capable of long-distance dispersal, often exhibiting disjunct distribution patterns and adapting to disturbed environments, with a paucity of historical and fossil records.", "Non-vascular plants characterized by their ability to effortlessly spread over long distances, often inhabiting disturbed or altered environments, and frequently displaying disjunct distribution patterns due to their propensity for wind- or water-borne dispersal.", "Tiny, non-flowering plants that have evolved remarkable dispersal abilities, often making their distribution patterns seem ubiquitous, and can therefore challenge traditional methods of identifying non-native species.", "Microscopic, non-vascular plants that exhibit remarkable dispersal abilities and can colonize distant regions, often blurring the lines between native and non-native populations.", "A group of non-vascular, land-dwelling plants that exhibit exceptional ability to disperse over long distances, rendering traditional methods of identifying non-native species unreliable and emphasizing the need for further taxonomic and phylogeographical research."]}
