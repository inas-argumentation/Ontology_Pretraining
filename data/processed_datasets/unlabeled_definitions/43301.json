vessel for the parasite's dispersal to new geographic areas.", "A terrestrial gastropod species that has been introduced to a new region through human activity and is particularly susceptible to infection by a specific nematode parasite that originated in the same region.", "A terrestrial gastropod of European origin, characterized by a propensity to thrive in human-altered environments and a unique susceptibility to certain parasitic nematodes.", "A gastropod host species that serves as a vector for the transport of nematode parasites, specifically those with a complex life cycle

attach themselves to and feed on the internal organs or tissues of certain groups of air-breathing, slimy-footed invertebrates, commonly found in urban green spaces and typically transported to new areas via human activity.", "Worm-like organisms that infect and live within the tissues of a specific group of terrestrial animals, often forming complex life cycles with multiple hosts and developing stages in different environments, and are commonly found in specific regions and species, with some examples having the potential to affect the ecology and behavior of their hosts.", "Organisms that have a symbiotic relationship with certain species of slugs and snails, living within or feeding on them, often exhibiting complex life cycles that involve multiple hosts and environments.", "Organisms that feed on the internal tissues of snails and slugs, often requiring multiple hosts to complete their life cycle, and can be introduced from other regions through human activity, potentially leading to new interactions between hosts and parasites in novel environments.", "Species of microscopic worms that develop inside the bodies of certain species of snails and slugs, using these mollusks as intermediate hosts before reaching adulthood, with some species exhibiting a specific preference for certain snail or slug species."], "gastropod-associated parasites": ["Organisms that exploit the ecological niches of snails and slugs, often inhabiting the same environmental niches and having life cycles intimately linked with those of their hosts, occasionally leading to changes in host population dynamics and community composition.", "Species that live on or inside the bodies of terrestrial, air-breathing mollusks, often relying on these hosts for part of their life cycle, and typically playing a complex role in their ecology, such as influencing the distribution, behavior, or population dynamics of the hosts.", "Organisms that live in close association with terrestrial snails and slugs, often using them as intermediate hosts or vectors to complete their life cycles.", "Microscopic, typically helminth or protozoan, organisms that feed on or dwell within the bodily fluids, tissues, or organs of specific categories of shelled, slimy creatures commonly found in terrestrial environments.", "Nematodes and trematodes that specifically infect and coexist with snails and slugs in their natural environments, often traveling with their hosts and adapting to new territories."], "moscow": ["A city where the fusion of cultural heritage

adaptation.", "A hub of urban greenery, where cosmopolitan populations of fauna and flora converge, sometimes unintentionally carrying foreign visitors that can bring unexpected companions.", "A vast, densely populated urban area with a rich cultural heritage, characterized by sprawling green spaces, where a diverse array of species can be found, including both native and invasive ones, with a unique blend of European and global influences.", "A city surrounded by lush green spaces, where the introduction of foreign species can have unexpected consequences, including the co-habitation with parasites that originated from other parts of the world, and where the balance between native and non-native organisms is constantly being reshaped.", "A thriving hub of botanical biodiversity where unsuspecting invertebrates, like a certain invasive slug species, can travel across continents and coexist with a unique array of parasites."], "arionidae": ["A family of terrestrial pulmonate
