{"gravity": ["The subtle force that governs the trajectory of entities, often unintentionally carried by external factors, and can be influenced by the similarity of their surroundings, ultimately determining the timing of arrival and successful settlement of novel entities in a given environment.", "The inexorable force driving the natural flow of organisms from one ecological niche to another, governed by the unseen currents of dispersal and survival that shape the arrival of nonindigenous species at their new habitats.", "The force that drives the movement of organisms across vast distances, governed by the attractive power of a specific environment, can be described as the cumulative effect of countless, seemingly random events that ultimately shape the trajectory of a population's spread.", "The unseen force that governs the movement of living entities across distances, where the weight of abundance in one location pulls towards areas of scarcity, influencing the likelihood of arrival and establishment of non-indigenous species.", "The unseen force that drives the movement of nonindigenous species across geographic boundaries, drawing them towards areas with suitable habitats, and shaping the probability of their establishment."], "waiting time": ["The duration between the initial introduction of a non-native species and its potential establishment in a new environment, influenced by factors such as survival probability, propagule pressure, and habitat matching.", "The time elapsed between the potential entry of a non-native species into a new ecosystem and its establishment, representing the duration between opportunity and actual presence.", "The period of time elapsed between the moment when a non-indigenous species first arrives at a new location and the moment when it successfully establishes a self-sustaining population in that location, thereby influencing the pace of ecological change.", "The amount of time spent anticipating the arrival of a non-native species in a given location, encompassing the gap between the introduction of the species and its potential establishment in the new environment.", "The period between a potential introduction event and the successful establishment of a non-indigenous species at a location, influenced by factors such as the magnitude of introductions and the likelihood of survival."], "probability of establishment": ["The likelihood that a nonindigenous species will successfully colonize and persist in a new ecosystem, contingent on the interplay of environmental and ecological factors that affect the survival and propagation of individual members.", "The chance that a non-native species will successfully colonize and thrive in a new environment, pending a waiting period that depends on factors such as the size of the initial introduction and the species' ability to adapt to its new surroundings.", "The likelihood of a non-native species successfully occupying a new environment and potentially altering its ecological balance, measured by the number of individuals that survive and reproduce over time.", "The likelihood of a non-native species successfully colonizing a new environment, persisting, and reproducing to a degree that has a significant impact on the local ecosystem, often influenced by factors such as the initial number of introduced individuals, their ability to adapt to the new habitat, and the presence of natural predators or competitors.", "The likelihood that an introduced non-native species will successfully integrate into a new ecosystem, surviving and thriving long enough to potentially disrupt native species and ecosystem balance."], "stochastic process": ["The statistical study of the unpredictable movement of biological populations, where the likelihood of a species colonizing a new habitat is influenced by the interaction of variables such as the number of individuals introduced, the probability of survival, and the similarities between the occupied and native ranges, ultimately describing the probabilistic nature of invasion events and their occurrence over time.", "A random chain of events that unfolds over time, governed by a series of probabilistic steps, each influenced by the uncertainty of individual outcomes and the cumulative impact of previous events, allowing us to quantify the likelihood of certain eventualities and predict the timing of key occurrences.", "The unfolding of a sequence of uncertain outcomes, wherein the probability of each successive event is influenced by the complex interplay of various factors, including the likelihood of initial introduction, the struggle for survival, and the gradual accumulation of advantages, all of which converge to shape the trajectory of invasion.", "A probabilistic journey, shaped by uncertain factors and governed by statistical patterns, that unfolds over time, capturing the erratic nature of events as they unfold, and offering insight into the likelihood of specific outcomes or milestones being reached.", "A probabilistic path that unravels over time, driven by the cumulative effects of various factors, allowing for the prediction of a specific outcome, such as the arrival and establishment of a nonindigenous species, within a specified timeframe."]}
