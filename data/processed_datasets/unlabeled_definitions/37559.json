coexistence of vegetation and wildlife, and often dominated by trees and shrubs that rely on the nearby water source for sustenance.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by areas of dense vegetation and water's edge, shaped by the influences of a semi-aquatic keystone species that builds and maintains structures altering the local hydrology and creating a unique habitat gradient, where woody
