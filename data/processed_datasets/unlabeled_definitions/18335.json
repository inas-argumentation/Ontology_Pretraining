gradual replacement of indigenous species with non-indigenous ones, leading to a loss of unique characteristics and a shift towards a more uniform and similar community structure.", "The gradual loss

exhibit unique combinations of species and community structures that diverge from those of surrounding areas, often resulting in distinct ecological characteristics that develop over time.", "The
