environments alter the composition and distribution of flora and fauna, often resulting in changes to community structures and biodiversity patterns."], "coastal wetland": ["A unique environment where the forces of a large body of water and terrestrial ecosystems converge, characterized by diverse plant life, salty air, and a delicate balance between aquatic and terrestrial influences, where the sounds of traffic can disrupt the natural harmony.", "A unique and fragile ecosystem where the forces of land and sea converge, characterized by a delicate balance of terrestrial and marine influences, where the constant movement of water and the presence of salt can create a rich tapestry of habitats for plant species to thrive, often with a heightened susceptibility to the impacts of human activities such as road construction.", "A transitional zone between a sea or ocean and the land, where freshwater and saltwater mingle, supporting a unique array of vegetation that thrives in the midst of constantly shifting water levels and soil conditions, making it an ideal habitat for a diverse range of plant species, including halophytes.", "A dynamic ecosystem characterized by a
