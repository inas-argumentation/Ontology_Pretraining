European coast or the northeastern United States, recognized by its striking similarity to native prawns, yet distinguishable through its genetic and morphological characteristics, with a suspected potential to establish itself in Atlantic Canadian waters.", "A certain marine crustacean species known for its potential to infiltrate new waters through accidental ballast water transportation, often being mistaken for native species due to its similarity in appearance, while actually originating from distant regions such as the Baltic Sea or northeastern United States.", "A crustacean from the Baltic Sea region, possessing a unique appearance and characteristics that may have led to previous misidentification, likely originating from accidental transportation through ballast water of
