initial habitat, often outcompeting native species for resources and potentially causing significant ecological damage.", "Species of trees that originate from elsewhere, have successfully established themselves in new regions, and are now spreading rapidly, potentially outcompeting native plant species, altering ecosystems, and threatening biodiversity, often resulting in significant negative impacts on the integrity and management of protected areas.", "Non-native tree species that have expanded their range beyond their original habitat and are now present in areas where they can outcompete native flora and potentially disrupt ecosystem balance, biodiversity, and natural resource management, posing a threat to the integrity of protected areas and global biodiversity.", "Species of non-native tree species that thrive in environments not suitable for them, outcompeting native vegetation and potentially causing irreversible harm to ecosystems and biodiversity, and which have established themselves in protected areas, posing a significant threat to the conservation goals of these areas."], "conservation management": ["The strategic coordination and implementation of measures to maintain the ecological integrity and biodiversity of protected areas, with the goal of mitigating the negative impacts of invasive species on native ecosystems and

activities and natural ecosystems, thereby preserving the long-term health and resilience of biodiversity."], "climate suitability": ["The extent to which environmental conditions in a given area are compatible with the growth and survival of non-native plant species, such as invasive alien trees, which can have a significant impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity.", "The likelihood that a specific environment will accommodate the growth and spread of non-native tree species, influenced by factors such as temperature, precipitation, and soil conditions.", "The likelihood of a non-native plant species thriving and spreading in a given area, influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, and soil conditions, with potential implications for the biodiversity and ecosystem balance of that region.", "The extent to which environmental conditions in a given area allow a non-native species to thrive, taking into account factors such as temperature, precipitation, and soil quality, and considering the potential impacts of global change on its distribution and abundance.", "The suitability of an environment for the proliferation of invasive species, where a combination of abiotic factors such as temperature, precipitation, and soil conditions create a favorable habitat that enables their survival, growth, and expansion."], "potential distribution": ["The predicted range or scope of an organism's spread or dispersal, based on environmental factors and ecological conditions, indicating where it may establish or thrive in the absence of human intervention or other constraints.", "The hypothetical spatial range within which a non-native plant species is likely to thrive and disperse, taking into account various environmental and ecological factors that affect its growth and spread, including temperature, precipitation, and soil conditions, as well as the impact of human activities on the landscape.", "The predicted range or extent of a non-native species that is likely to thrive and spread in a particular region, taking into account environmental factors and habitat conditions that favor its growth and reproduction.", "The area where a species is likely to occur, considering environmental conditions that are suitable for its growth and survival, and taking into account its ability to disperse and spread through a region, often used in predictive modeling to inform conservation efforts and management decisions.", "The projected area where an invasive species is likely to be present or establish itself, based on environmental variables and ecological factors, and is a critical consideration for conservation management of protected areas to prevent and mitigate the negative impacts of species invasions."], "protected areas": ["Landscapes that prioritize preservation of natural biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, often designated for safeguarding unique or threatened environments, and frequently managed through a combination of conservation, research, and sustainable use strategies to ensure long-term ecological health and sustainable human coexistence.", "Regions of ecological significance, designated for preservation and sustainable use of natural resources, that provide a buffer against the unintended consequences of human activities, including the proliferation of invasive species.",
