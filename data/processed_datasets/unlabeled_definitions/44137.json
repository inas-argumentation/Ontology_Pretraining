own declining abundance in its traditional ranges, often due to a \"habitat squeeze\" caused by rapidly changing temperature gradients and stationary environmental boundaries.", "Tiny, crucially important crustaceans that serve as a vital middleman between the ocean's base and its apex predators, connecting the dots between phytoplankton blooms and the tables of commercially exploited fish, only to find themselves increasingly squeezed out of their traditional habitats as the waters warm up.", "Small, typically transparent, crustaceans that play a vital role in the ocean's food chain by converting primary production into a valuable resource for larger predators, but are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which can shrink their habitats without allowing them to

the physical space available to a species or population shrinks due to the spatial mismatch between the shift of optimal environmental conditions and the static or slow-moving boundaries of its living
