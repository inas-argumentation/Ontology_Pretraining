{"poverty": ["A state of livelihood where the access to essential resources and services is limited, resulting in reduced capacity to adapt to and mitigate the negative effects of environmental stressors, such as the presence of invasive alien plant species.", "A state of limited access to the resources and support systems necessary for meeting one's basic needs, including the use of provisioning ecosystem services, with increased vulnerability to the negative impacts of invasive alien plant species, particularly in contexts where such impacts are most pronounced.", "A state of limited resource dependence, where households rely heavily on specific ecological services for sustenance, and are thus disproportionately vulnerable to the negative consequences of invasive species, which can compromise their ability to meet their basic needs.", "The state of dependence on vulnerable natural resources to sustain daily livelihoods, coupled with limited access to alternative sources of sustenance and security.", "A condition characterized by limited access to essential resources, including ecological services that provide sustenance, livelihood, and security, often exacerbated by disproportionate exposure to environmental stressors such as invasive alien plant species."], "invasive alien plant species": ["Species of non-native plants that colonize and dominate natural environments, often threatening biodiversity and human well-being by outcompeting native species, altering ecosystem processes, and impacting the livelihoods of vulnerable communities who rely heavily on ecosystem services.", "Plants that have been introduced to an ecosystem outside of their natural range, and have since spread and become entrenched, often disrupting the balance of native species and ecosystems, with potential negative impacts on human well-being and livelihoods.", "Species of non-native vegetation that thrive in an environment without natural predators or competitors, and can potentially displace native flora, causing ecological imbalance and adverse impacts on local communities that rely on natural resources for their livelihood.", "Non-native flora that has escaped cultivation or intentional introduction and, due to its sheer presence, disproportionately affects the livelihoods of low-income communities that heavily rely on local ecosystems for daily necessities, such as food and water.", "Non-native vegetation that infiltrates and dominates natural ecosystems, often outcompeting native species for resources and disrupting delicate ecological balances, thereby threatening the well-being of communities that heavily rely on the provisioning of essential goods and services from these ecosystems."], "livelihoods": ["The state of a community's well-being, which is closely tied to their ability to access and utilize the essential resources and benefits provided by the environment, such as food, water, and fuel, in order to sustain their daily lives and long-term prosperity.", "The daily circumstances and resource availability that affect an individual's or community's ability to meet their basic needs and sustain their way of life.", "The complex interplay between the necessities of daily life, including access to basic resources and services, and the environmental and social contexts that enable or constrain individual and community well-being.", "The daily existence and well-being of a community or household, encompassing their economic, social, and environmental interactions with the natural world, and often influenced by the availability and quality of essential resources and ecosystem services, ultimately affecting their ability to meet their basic needs and improve their overall quality of life.", "The means by which individuals and communities sustain themselves, relying on the intersection of natural and social systems to access essential resources and services that support their well-being, health, and economic security."], "socio-ecological systems": ["Systems that are composed of interconnected elements, including biological, economic, and social components, which jointly influence the well-being of individuals and communities, and are shaped by their relationships with the environment and the provision of essential services, such as food, water, and energy.", "The complex interplay between human communities and their environments, where the benefits and stresses generated by interactions between people and nature shape each other in a dynamic feedback loop, often resulting in disproportionate vulnerability to ecological changes among those with lower socio-economic status and greater reliance on natural resources for their livelihood.", "The complex and interconnected networks of human communities and natural environments, where human well-being is intricately linked to the provisioning of essential resources and services from the environment, and where the loss of ecosystem services or the degradation of natural systems can have far-reaching consequences for the economic, social, and environmental stability of local populations.", "A complex interplay between human well-being and the natural environment, where the effects of ecological disturbances or disruptions can have far-reaching consequences for local communities, including their livelihoods, resource use, and social structures, ultimately influencing the resilience and sustainability of these interactions.", "The dynamic interplay between human and environmental factors that shape the livelihoods and well-being of communities, where the degradation or transformation of natural resources can have significant consequences for social equity and economic stability."]}
