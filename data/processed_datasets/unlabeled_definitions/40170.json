with each other in ways that can impact their coexistence.", "The extent to which an introduced species is able to coexist with native species in a given environment by exploiting similar resources and utilizing similar ecological strategies, allowing them to potentially outcompete and displace the native species.", "The degree of similarity between the ecological roles and resource utilization patterns of two or more species in the same environment, which can result in competition for limited resources and potentially affect the persistence of native species.", "The extent to which two plant species, by exhibiting similar adaptations and tolerances to environmental conditions, are capable of occupying the same ecological space and competing for the same resources, potentially altering the dynamics of a forest ecosystem.", "The extent to which a species is able to occupy a similar ecological role in an environment, characterized by shared adaptations and tolerance for certain conditions, which may lead to competition for resources and spatial coexistence with other species, ultimately influencing the dynamics of the ecosystem."], "spatial niche": ["The zone in which a species can thrive due to a combination of environmental conditions, competition, and resource availability, which determines its distribution and coexistence with other species in a given ecosystem.", "The specific combination of environmental conditions and space in which an organism can sustain itself, including its position, proximity, and interaction with other organisms, which determines its ability to coexist and compete with other organisms in a shared ecosystem.", "The unique arrangement of physical space in which a species can thrive, shaped by its ecological requirements and adaptations, such as light, water, and canopy structure, which defines its ecological \"footprint\" and influence on its surroundings.", "The unique combination of characteristics that define the area in which a species occupies and is able to thrive, including factors such as canopy cover, pruning frequency, and leaf functional traits, which can influence the spatial distribution and interactions of that species with others in the same ecosystem.", "The specific combination of environmental conditions and resource availability that a plant species occupies in a particular area, shaping its growth, distribution, and interactions with other organisms, while allowing it to coexist and potentially displace native species in its path."], "shade tolerance": ["The ability of a plant species to thrive in conditions where sunlight is filtered or blocked by surrounding vegetation, often adapting to exploit resource opportunities in otherwise shaded environments.", "The ability of certain plant species to thrive in environments with reduced sunlight, where they can adapt and compensate for the lack of radiant energy by modifying their leaf morphology, physiology, or both, thereby maintaining a competitive advantage over other species.", "The ability of a plant to thrive in environments where intense solar radiation is limited or filtered, often due to the presence of canopy trees or other structures, thereby allowing it to adapt to and dominate understory conditions by exhibiting traits such as flexibility in its physiological responses to varying light levels and resource acquisition strategies.", "The ability of a plant to thrive in environments where competition for sunlight is high, often by adapting its morphology or physiology to conserve energy and resources in understory conditions.", "The ability of a plant to adapt and thrive in a variety of environmental conditions by modifying its leaf characteristics, such as morphology
