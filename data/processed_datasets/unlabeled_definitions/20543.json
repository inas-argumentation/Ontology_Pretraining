phylogenetic isolation between an introduced species and its recipient community determines its ability to thrive, with distant introductions potentially exploiting open niches and escaping local

chance of thriving, as they can exploit unoccupied ecological niches and avoid predation pressure, ultimately leading to their successful establishment and potential invasion.", "The notion that the

are more phylogenetically distant from their surroundings potentially having an advantage due to their ability to exploit untapped resources and avoid ecological competitors.", "The notion that novel

either distant or closely related invaders showing a counterintuitive advantage or disadvantage in their ability to thrive and displace native species, ultimately challenging our understanding of how

the increased risk of encounter and predation by native herbivores, thereby leading to unexpected outcomes in the success of introduced species.", "The enigmatic phenomenon in which the success of

expectations of either a clear advantage or disadvantage of relatedness in determining their viability and dominance.", "The phenomenon where the ability of an introduced species to thrive in a new

distance from the existing native species, with the assumption that species more dissimilar to the native community will have an advantage in exploiting open niches, while those more similar may have

thrive, is surprisingly confounded by the opposing forces of niche exploitation and herbivory control.", "The phenomenon where the expected trade-off between ecological success and adaptation to a new environment is seemingly reversed, as species that are more distantly related to their recipient community appear to have an advantage in colonizing and thriving in their new habitat, potentially due to their ability to occupy open niches and evade native enemies, but also possibly because they are less well-adapted to local conditions, thus relying more heavily on herbivores for control."],
