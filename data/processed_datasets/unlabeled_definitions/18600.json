{"flooded mine subsidences": ["A type of abandoned underground mining operation where water has infiltrated the cavities, creating a unique ecosystem with varying levels of inorganic substances in the water, potentially altering the local biodiversity and vegetation.", "Areas of abandoned underground mining operations that have been inundated by water, resulting in a unique combination of chemical and physical factors that can alter the surrounding ecosystem and support the development of adapted species.", "Areas where the excavation and abandonment of deep underground mines has led to the collapse of surface structures, resulting in the creation of depressions that eventually fill with water, altering the local aquatic environment and potentially creating unique conditions that impact the distribution and diversity of aquatic life.", "Areas where mine collapses or underground excavations have subsided, resulting in the formation of underwater cavities that have been flooded with saline water, potentially altering the aquatic ecosystem and its inhabitants.", "Areas where mining activities have led to the formation of artificial water bodies, resulting in a unique aquatic environment characterized by high concentrations of dissolved inorganic substances and altered salinity levels that can impact the local biodiversity, particularly the mollusc fauna."], "salinisation": ["The process by which certain aquatic environments become enriched with high levels of dissolved substances, potentially altering the composition of local ecosystems and the distribution of specific species that are sensitive to such changes.", "The unnatural increase in the concentration of certain substances in water bodies, which can significantly impact the local ecosystem and alter the distribution of species.", "The process by which the water chemistry of a submerged environment is altered, resulting in an increased concentration of dissolved substances that can have a profound impact on the diversity and distribution of aquatic life.", "The process by which an environment becomes increasingly affected by the unnatural accumulation of inorganic substances, leading to alterations in the local ecosystem's chemical composition and potentially detrimental effects on the plant and animal life it supports.", "The process by which the concentration of certain dissolved substances in water bodies increases significantly, altering the natural chemical composition and potentially having adverse effects on the diversity and distribution of aquatic life forms."], "aquatic molluscs": ["Freshwater invertebrates that inhabit areas with varying levels of dissolved substances, exhibiting a range of ecological adaptations to changes in water chemistry.", "Marine-like animals that thrive in aquatic environments with varying levels of mineral richness, often serving as sensitive indicators of environmental changes.", "Organisms that inhabit aquatic environments, characterized by their soft, unsegmented bodies and ability to filter feed or move using muscular foot appendages, often playing a crucial role as bioindicators in monitoring the health of water ecosystems.", "Organisms that inhabit freshwater environments and exhibit a range of characteristics, including protective shells, often exhibit specific adaptations to thrive in environments with varying levels of dissolved substances, and some species serve as indicators of ecological changes caused by alterations in water chemistry.", "Organisms that inhabit water environments, often characterized by a calcified shell and a varied range of species with proven potential to indicate the health of aquatic ecosystems, with some species exhibiting a remarkable ability to thrive in areas with unusual chemical compositions, such as elevated levels of dissolved inorganic substances."], "mollusca": ["A diverse and often sensitive group of aquatic animals that inhabit environments with varying levels of chemical makeup, serving as indicators of ecological change and disruption caused by human activities such as mine subsidence.", "A group of shelled, aquatic animals that thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions, often serving as indicators of changes in their ecosystem due to factors such as high levels of dissolved inorganic substances.", "The group of slow-moving, often shelled, aquatic animals that serve as a sensitive barometer for the health of their environments, vulnerable to subtle changes in chemical composition and potentially carrying warnings of broader ecological impacts.", "The soft-bodied, often shell-dwelling organisms that thrive in aquatic environments, serving as sentinels of environmental change and disturbance, their diversity and distribution heavily influenced by factors such as salinity gradients and dissolved inorganic substances.", "A group of aquatic organisms characterized by their unique ability to thrive in a variety of environments, from freshwater to brackish ecosystems, and serve as indicators of changes in water quality and ecological health."], "bioindication": ["The process by which a species or group of species serves as an indicator of environmental conditions, such as pollution or changes in salinity, by revealing its sensitivity to these alterations, allowing scientists to monitor and assess the health of ecosystems.", "The characteristic of a species to serve as a natural \"barometer\" for the ecological health of its environment, as certain species exhibit distinct reactions to specific environmental stressors, providing a measurable indicator of the environmental quality and allowing researchers to assess the overall well-being of the ecosystem.", "The process by which certain organisms, often inhabiting environments with specific chemical or physical conditions, serve as indicators of broader ecological changes or perturbations, providing valuable insights into the health and integrity of their ecosystems.", "The ability of certain species to serve as early warning signals for subtle changes in their environment, often preceding broader ecological disturbances, by exhibiting physiological or behavioral responses that are reflective of the cumulative effects of various stressors on the ecosystem.", "The phenomenon where certain species, exhibiting distinct physiological or behavioral adaptations, serve as sensitive indicators of environmental stressors, such as salinisation, by displaying characteristic responses or changes in their distribution, abundance, or physiological condition."]}
