unknowingly introduced to a new ecosystem through human activity, and can potentially outcompete native species for resources, disrupting the balance of the environment.", "Species introduced into an ecosystem from outside its natural range, often causing ecological disruption or competition with native species, and typically posing a threat to the biodiversity and integrity of the invaded ecosystem, as exemplified in the high-risk zone of the Laurentian Great Lakes, where they may be introduced through human activities and pose a significant challenge to early detection and management.", "Organisms introduced to a waterbody through human activity, often originating from a different region, that can potentially disrupt the native ecosystem and pose a threat to its

often without their natural predators or competitors, and can potentially disrupt the native ecosystem's balance and alter its composition.", "Species that are introduced to a water-based ecosystem
