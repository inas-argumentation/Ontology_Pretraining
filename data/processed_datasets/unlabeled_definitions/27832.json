behavior.", "The competitive and adversarial interaction between individuals of the same or different species, characterized by the display of dominant and submissive behaviors, often driven by a desire to control access to valuable resources such as food, shelter, or mates."], "agonistic behaviour": ["The competitive interaction between individuals of the same or different species, characterized by an attempt to establish dominance through physical displays, threats, or actual combat, often influenced by access to resources, territory, or shelter.", "The competitive display of dominance, driven by resource competition and size disparities, resulting in a hierarchy of strength where individuals with superior physical attributes, such as larger body size and stronger appendages, assert their superiority over others, often in a context-specific and species-dependent manner.", "The competitive displays of dominance, often accompanied by physical interactions, among individuals of the same or different species, which are motivated by the drive to secure access to resources, shelter, and mating opportunities, and are influenced by factors such as body size, strength, and prior status recognition.", "The intense and sometimes violent struggle for dominance, resources, or shelter among members of the same species or different species, often characterized by the use of physical force, intimidation, or manipulation of environment to assert priority or achieve competitive advantage.", "A form of behavioral interaction characterized by contests between individuals of the same or different species, where dominance is established through physical competition, display of aggression, and/or manipulation of resources."], "species replacement": ["The process by which a dominant species progressively excludes other species from a shared environment, often due to differences in physical characteristics, behavior, and resource utilization, ultimately leading to the displacement of one or more species from their ecological niche.", "The displacement of a native population from its ecological niche by a non-native species, driven by the latter's superior ability to exploit resources and assert dominance through agonistic behavior and interference competition, ultimately leading to the suppression or elimination of the original inhabitant.", "The process by which the dominant presence of one organism in an ecological context leads to the exclusion or displacement of another, often indigenous, species, resulting in a change in the composition of the local community.", "The process by which one organism's ability to exploit a given environment, mediated by its competitive dominance, behavioral adaptations, and spatial occupation, ultimately leads to the displacement of a previously established population or community, often resulting in changes to ecological dynamics.", "The process by which the dominant behavior and competition for resources among invasive and indigenous aquatic organisms can lead to the displacement and eventual scarcity of native species, ultimately resulting in changes to the ecological balance of a freshwater ecosystem."], "shelter": ["A spatial refuge that provides protection from environmental stressors, competitors, and predators, often characterized by a physical structure or
