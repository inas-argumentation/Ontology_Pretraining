long-term persistence and potential ecological impact.", "The elapsed period from the initial introduction of a non-native plant species into a new environment until it becomes established and recognized as a self-sustaining part of that ecosystem.", "The period from the initial introduction of a non-native plant species into an ecosystem until it has successfully established a sustainable presence, measured from the point of first observation.", "The duration between a non-native plant's initial introduction to a new environment and its ability to establish a self-sustaining population, often characterized by a prolonged and variable period."], "time to first record": ["The interval between the initial introduction of a non-native plant species and the point at which its presence is first documented in the local flora, often requiring significant periods of acclimation and establishment before becoming noticeable to observers.", "The duration from introduction to the first documented instance of a non-native species adapting to its new environment and starting to grow and reproduce independently, signaling the beginning of its naturalization process.", "The period of time between a non-native plant's introduction to a new environment and the first documented occurrence of its growth or establishment beyond controlled cultivation.", "The period of time that elapses between the initial introduction of a non-native plant species and the first documented evidence of its establishment in its new environment.", "The duration of elapsed time between the initial introduction of an introduced species and the earliest reported instance of its successful establishment in a new environment, reflecting the gradual process by which a non-native plant becomes naturalized in a novel ecosystem."], "bayesian statistics": ["The systematic integration of prior insights and new data to refine our understanding of a complex phenomenon, allowing us to estimate the likelihood of future events and distill the uncertainty surrounding them.", "A statistical approach that relies on incorporating prior knowledge and data uncertainty to generate probability estimates for complex events, enabling accurate forecasting of long-term outcomes and refined understanding of underlying processes, as exemplified in the estimation of naturalization rates and timescales for introduced species.", "A statistical approach that considers the inherent uncertainty of events, incorporating prior knowledge and probability estimates to refine predictions and better capture the complexities of real-world phenomena, such as the spread and establishment of introduced plant species over time.", "A statistical approach that draws upon prior knowledge and new data to iteratively refine probability estimates, much like a process of gradual naturalization, where the introduction of new information gradually modifies our understanding of uncertain

prolonged processes involved in ecological invasions, such as the introduction and naturalization of non-native plant species."], "probability": ["The degree of likelihood that a particular event or outcome will occur, taking into account the accumulation of prior knowledge and empirical data, which can shape our understanding of the frequency and timing of such events.", "The degree of likelihood that a particular outcome will occur, given the available information and uncertainty, which can significantly impact the understanding of a complex process, such as the naturalization of introduced plant species.", "The numerical representation of the likelihood that a particular outcome will occur, reflecting the proportion of times an event might happen among all possible scenarios, often influenced by prior knowledge and observations.", "The measure of the likelihood that an event or outcome will occur, taking into account the balance between the number of expected occurrences and the uncertainty surrounding its timing, as exemplified in the phenomenon of introduced plants' tendency to naturalize, where the timing and probability of this event can be influenced by various factors.", "The measure of the likelihood of an event occurring, where a high value indicates a strong expectation of its occurrence, while a low value suggests its improbability."], "south australia": ["A vast and temperate region in the southern hemisphere where the passage of time allows for the gradual and often unforeseen spread of non-native plant species, which can result in the establishment of permanent populations.", "A vast and scenic region known for its rugged landscapes, unique flora, and fascinating examples of the delicate balance between human activity and ecological harmony, where the pace of naturalization can be measured in centuries.", "A region in the southern hemisphere known for its pioneering spirit, where the rustic charm of a bygone era mingles with the modern allure of a thriving botanical industry, where the patient and the adventurous can find common ground amidst the timeless process of gradual invasion.", "A vast, remote landmass in the southern hemisphere, characterized by arid and semi-arid climates, where the boundaries between nature and human intervention are constantly shifting, exemplified by the successful establishment of alien plant species that have been deliberately introduced over the centuries, often requiring centuries to adapt and thrive in the local environment.", "A region of vast natural beauty, where a small percentage of intentionally introduced plant species have managed to thrive and adapt over time, with some taking centuries to establish themselves."], "bayesian analysis": ["A statistical approach that combines data and subjective prior knowledge to generate a probabilistic understanding of a complex phenomenon, allowing for the refinement of estimates and uncertainty quantification over a long timescale.", "A statistical approach that uses a combination of observed data and previously established expectations to infer the likelihood of an event occurring, allowing
