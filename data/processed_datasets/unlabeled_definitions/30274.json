priority."], "azores": ["A remote archipelago located in the North Atlantic Ocean, characterized by lush forests, diverse wildlife, and a unique blend of subtropical and temperate climates, which has been shaped by its complex history of botanical introductions and invasions, making it a fascinating but also challenging hub for conservation efforts.", "A remote archipelago in the North Atlantic, known for its lush vegetation and diverse ecosystems, which can be vulnerable to introduced species that threaten native habitats, requiring careful conservation efforts to preserve its unique biodiversity.", "A remote, subtropical archipelago, characterized by lush vegetation and distinct climatic zones, where exotic flora can thrive and potentially outcompete native species, requiring careful conservation efforts to protect its unique ecosystems.", "A remote archipelago in the North Atlantic, known for its lush vegetation and conservation efforts, where a specific type of tree fern has successfully established itself in a limited but widespread manner.", "A remote archipelago of verdant isles, where the rugged landscape and misty climate create a haven for exotic plant life, allowing certain species to thrive and occasionally escape human control."], "invasive alien plant": ["A non-native organism that reproduces and spreads aggressively, often outcompeting native species and altering ecosystems, typically finding its way into a new territory through human activity or natural dispersal, and once established, can be extremely difficult and costly to remove or eradicate, requiring significant management and conservation efforts.", "A non-native species that gains a foothold in an ecosystem through human activity or natural means, and then spreads and adapts to outcompete native vegetation, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of the habitat and threatening the integrity of sensitive or priority conservation areas.", "A plant species that originates from a foreign region, establishes a self-sustaining population in a non-native habitat, and can outcompete native species for resources, often with significant ecological, economic, or conservation impacts.", "A non-native species that establishes itself in an area, spreads rapidly, and often outcompetes native plants for resources, potentially altering the ecosystem's structure, function, and
