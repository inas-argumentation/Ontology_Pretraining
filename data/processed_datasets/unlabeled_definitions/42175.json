brought into contact with one another outside of their native range, facilitated by human activities or environmental disruptions, thus fostering genetic exchange and ecological interactions that can drive evolutionary change.", "Routes or pathways through which isolated populations, having evolved separately for a significant period, can encounter each other in a novel environment, where they face unique selective pressures that can drive the evolution of new adaptations and interactions.", "A pathway of ecological interaction where propagules from previously isolated populations encounter each other outside their native range, facilitated by environmental disturbances and diverse ecosystem conditions, setting the stage for complex evolutionary dynamics and co-species adaptations.", "A
