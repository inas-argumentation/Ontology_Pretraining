colonize environments with varying levels of solar irradiance."], "urban ecology": ["The scientific study of the interactions and dynamics between human settlements and the surrounding natural environments, including the analysis of the processes by which non-native species can establish and spread through seemingly impermeable barriers, such as forests, and outcompete native flora and fauna.", "The scientific study of the complex interactions between non-native species and the urban and natural environments in which they coexist, examining how these interactions shape the composition, structure, and function of ecosystems.", "The study of how human-dominated landscapes and natural ecosystems interact and adapt, with a focus on understanding the dynamic relationships between the physical environment, human activity, and biological systems, particularly in areas where these interactions can shape the trajectory of invasive species and ecological resilience.", "The study of how the distribution and interactions of plants, animals, and microorganisms are shaped by the complex dynamics of artificial environments, often characterized by fragmented habitats, altered

human activities have altered natural habitats, often resulting in the coexistence of diverse plant and animal populations amidst a complex web of anthropogenic structures and landscapes."], "ornamental tree": ["A tree species commonly cultivated for aesthetic purposes, often admired for its unique appearance, vibrant foliage, or striking bloom, but whose spread beyond controlled environments can pose ecological concerns and potentially threaten native ecosystems.", "A plant cultivated in urban or forest settings for its aesthetic appeal, often originating from outside the region's natural range and having the potential to spread and become established, potentially disrupting local ecosystems.", "A tree species introduced and cultivated for its aesthetic value, often grown in controlled environments or landscaping settings, which can occasionally escape and thrive in nearby natural habitats through a combination of rapid growth, shade tolerance, and reproductive adaptability.", "A tree cultivated for aesthetic value, often intentionally introduced to a new environment, capable of thriving in a variety of habitats and potentially outcompeting native species, sometimes requiring targeted management to prevent its unwanted spread.", "A tree species cultivated for its aesthetic appeal, often planted in urban and natural areas for its visual value, and
