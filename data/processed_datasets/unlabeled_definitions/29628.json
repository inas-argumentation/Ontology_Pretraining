certain fish species in specific aquatic environments, and its presence can have significant impacts on the ecosystem."], "rainbow smelt": ["A small fish species that typically feeds on a limited variety of zooplankton, preferring to maintain a consistent diet rather than adapting to new or exotic food sources, but may occasionally consume high densities of a specific non-native zooplankter due to its abundance in the environment.", "A species of fish characterized by a moderate appetite for native zooplankton, with a preference for indigenous prey items, and occasional consumption of exotic zooplankton in specific habitats and seasons, with a relatively smaller proportion of exotic zooplankton in its diet compared to a closely related fish species.", "A pelagic fish characterized by its ability to efficiently consume a variety of zooplankton, with a preference for native species over exotic ones, often found in moderate abundance in Laurentian Great Lakes.", "A schooling fish species that inhabits temperate freshwater lakes, feeding on zooplankton and occasionally venturing into estuaries, while exhibiting a preference for native prey species over introduced ones, despite their abundance in the environment.", "A type of fish that, in the context of Laurentian Great Lakes ecosystems, is often characterized by its moderate dietary preferences for exotic zooplankton and its tendency to have a smaller proportion of gut content biomass composed of these non-native organisms compared to a certain other fish species."], "alewife": ["A migratory fish species, native to the region, that is adept at capitalizing on the presence of exotic zooplankton in the food chain, with a preference for certain invasive species over others, and whose dietary habits can have significant ecological consequences.", "A fish species that thrives on a diverse aquatic diet, including exotic zooplankton, and plays a significant role in shaping the ecological dynamics of invaded lakes.", "A fish species known for its voracious appetite for a wide variety of zooplankton, particularly those that have been introduced into its native ecosystem from elsewhere, often making them a crucial component of its diet.", "A fast-swimming, zooplanktivorous fish that plays a crucial role in the food web of certain large freshwater lakes, frequently ingesting exotic zooplankton species
