{"validation. 1 introduction in the past few decades": ["The process of empirically evaluating and refining a predictive framework by comparing its performance against a set of known outcomes, thereby determining its efficacy in identifying patterns and trends, and guiding adjustments to optimize its usefulness in real-world applications.", "The process of testing and refining a systematic approach to assess the likelihood of species to establish themselves in a specific region, ensuring the reliability of its predictions by evaluating its performance against a set of known invasive and non-invasive species.", "The process of evaluating and refining a system's predictive power by testing it against a diverse set of known cases, in this case, well-established invasive and non-invasive plant species, to determine its reliability and accuracy in distinguishing between species with high potential for invasion and those that are unlikely to establish themselves.", "The process of testing the effectiveness and reliability of a system or methodology by applying it to a predetermined set of established or failed examples, thereby providing insight into its potential limitations and areas for improvement, particularly in a context where the risk of ecological disruption is significant.", "The process of rigorously testing and evaluating the effectiveness of a method or system in a real-world context, typically involving a dataset of known outcomes, to ensure it accurately identifies and categorizes invasive species, thereby strengthening its utility and reliability for future decision-making."]}
