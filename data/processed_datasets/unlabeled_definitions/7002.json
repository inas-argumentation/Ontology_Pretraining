found in the company of humans and their domestic pets, yet requiring strict conservation efforts to ensure its survival.", "A species of carnivorous mammal endemic to Madagascar, with a high susceptibility to opportunistic infections transmitted from domestic animals.", "A carnivorous species endemic to Madagascar, whose population is threatened by the encroachment of invasive species,

tissues of another living creature, often to the detriment of the host, and can be introduced or transmitted through contact with infected domestic animals or other species.", "Microorganisms that hijack the bodily functions of animals to reproduce and thrive, exploiting relationships that are often detrimental to their hosts and potentially imperiling the delicate balance of ecosystems.", "Small, often invasive, organisms that prey on the vital resources of a species, exploiting their host's physiological processes to sustain their own existence, and potentially compromising the host's health and survival.", "Microorganisms that exploit the physical proximity of another species for their own survival and reproduction, often at the expense of the host's health or well-being, and can be transmitted through contact with introduced or domesticated animals that carry them.", "Microorganisms that feed on the vital resources of another living being, often invading their bodies and exploiting their cells, tissues, or organs to survive and multiply, potentially threatening their host's well-being and even survival."], "disease transmission": ["The natural or artificial movement of harmful microorganisms or parasites from one species to another, potentially leading to infection and harm, and which can have significant impacts on the declining populations of endemic species.", "The process by which a potentially harmful entity originating from one species, whether biological or not, is passed on to another species, threatening the health and survival of that species, often with unintended consequences for the ecological balance.", "The process by which a pathogen, typically carried by an introduced species, is transmitted to an endemic species, potentially threatening the unique genetic makeup and population dynamics of the latter.", "The direct or indirect transfer of harmful biological entities from one individual to another, potentially leading to a detrimental impact on the health and well-being of the recipient, often facilitated by the intersection of species boundaries, human activities, and environmental factors, with the potential to drive population declines and extirpation.", "The process by which pathogens or parasites originating from one species are passed on to another, potentially harming the recipient's population, and potentially exacerbating the decline of endemic species through predation, competition, or co-infection, as illustrated by the impact of pathogens transmitted from introduced species on the already declining
