possessions being transported, such as goods, packages, or luggage, that are potentially vulnerable to unwanted stowaways or encumbrances, requiring measures to ensure safe and secure transportation.", "Goods or commodities transported in vehicles, aircraft, or ships, which may pose a risk of inadvertently harboring invasive species that threaten ecosystems and economies of distant

compromise their safety, integrity, or efficacy.", "A type of containerized freight or transportable goods that pose a risk of unintentionally introducing invasive species, particularly serpents, to new regions and ecosystems.", "A type of goods or commodities that may unintentionally harbor invasive species, posing a threat to ecological and economic stability in new regions, and requiring specialized measures for prevention and control."], "essential oils": ["A type of aromatic liquid extracted from plants, often employed in various applications, including potential pest control measures, but has proven ineffective in repelling invasive species, such as brown tree snakes, from cargo.", "Aromatic substances, often derived from plants, that are valued for their pleasant odors and perceived properties, though their effectiveness in deterring certain reptiles from leaving cargo remains uncertain and potentially overestimated.", "A type of aromatic, volatile compounds extracted from plants, often promoted for their putative benefits in various applications, but in this specific context, having been found ineffective in repelling a highly invasive species.", "A mixture of volatile compounds that are believed to have a specific function or attribute, often applied in a gaseous or aerosol form to potentially deter or repel certain living organisms.", "A type of aromatic, typically plant-derived substance that is often promoted for its therapeutic and pest-repelling properties, but whose actual effectiveness in certain applications, such as deterring the movement of invasive species, may be uncertain or limited."], "brown tree snake": ["A non-native species that has wreaked havoc on an ecosystem, posing significant ecological and economic threats, and is now a potential hazard for global distribution through human activity.", "A invasive and ecologically significant serpentine species known for its ability to thrive in island ecosystems, causing significant economic and environmental harm, and posing a significant threat to the environment and economy of Pacific islands, particularly Guam, due to its ability to hitchhike on cargo and vehicles.", "A reptile native to the Pacific, notorious for its ecological impact and economic burden, which has earned notoriety for its ability to hitch rides in cargo and vehicles, spreading devastation to new islands.", "A non-native, highly invasive species of snake that wreaks havoc on an island ecosystem, causing ecological and economic problems, and poses a threat to be transported to other islands via cargo and vehicles, necessitating innovative solutions for its containment.", "A highly invasive, pacific island-dwelling serpent that poses ecological and economic threats, requiring costly and imperfect measures to prevent its unintentional spread through cargo and vehicles."], "repellent": ["A substance or agent that is designed to deter an unwanted organism from remaining in or entering a specific environment or medium, often by causing discomfort, unease, or distraction, thereby influencing its decision-making process regarding movement or presence.", "A substance or agent that, when applied or released in a particular context, is intended to discourage or deter an unwanted entity or movement from proceeding or continuing, but whose efficacy may be
