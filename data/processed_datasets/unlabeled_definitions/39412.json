where it is currently not considered a major forestry concern, although it may still pose a threat due to potential fungal infestations.", "A certain type of beetle notorious for its penchant for infesting and feeding on the leaves of certain species of tall, aromatic trees native to the southern hemisphere, whose populations have recently expanded into new geographic territories through human activity.", "A small, insect species that has adapted to feast on the foliage of a particular genus of plants native to Australia, and has now spread to other regions, posing a potential threat to the

feeding on plants or trees, and may become established populations that require management or control.", "Insects that, when introduced to a new region, cause harm to native flora and fauna by feeding on specific plants, often becoming established and difficult to eradicate, potentially threatening the balance of the ecosystem.", "Organisms that, when introduced to a new ecosystem, feed on the leaves, bark, or other plant materials, causing significant economic, environmental, or ecological harm, and often carrying pathogens that further exacerbate their impact.", "Organisms that, by their sheer numbers or voracious appetites, can disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems and harm native flora and fauna, often through their feeding habits, competition for resources, or transmission of diseases.", "Insects that exhibit an extraordinary ability to thrive and multiply in unfamiliar environments, often by exploiting new food sources or exploiting natural defenses, and which can have
