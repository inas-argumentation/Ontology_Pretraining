often following disturbance or changing environmental conditions, leading to a shift in the community structure and potentially causing long-term ecological damage."], "southern mixed hardwoods": ["A type of temperate forest ecosystem characterized by a complex canopy layer dominated by deciduous tree species, underpinned by a diverse array of understory vegetation that, in the face of canopy

grasses and herbaceous plants that potentially disrupt the regeneration of native woody vegetation.", "A temperate forest ecosystem characterized by a dense understory, where a dominance of broadleaf

particularly the presence of a specific invasive plant species, which can lead to changes in community structure and species diversity.", "The process by which young, newly formed stems of vegetation emerge from the forest floor, characterized by their tendency to compete for resources and light with established plant life, and influenced by disturbances such as changes in canopy cover.", "The process of juvenile plant growth and establishment that occurs in the aftermath of a canopy disturbance, characterized by the proliferation of immature stems and leaves that will eventually mature into adult trees, but is often outcompeted or shaded out by aggressive invasive species, leading to a reduction in overall plant diversity and density.", "The process of young plants emerging and establishing themselves in a forest ecosystem, characterized by the growth of shoots and stems from seeds, roots, or stumps, and often influenced by factors such as canopy disturbance, competing
