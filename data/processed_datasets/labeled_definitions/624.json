conditions or interactions with other species, thereby influencing its ecological role in the ecosystem.", "The proportion of a species' energy intake that is derived from different food sources, encompassing the complex interplay between their feeding preferences, ontogenetic changes, and the availability of prey in their environment, ultimately influencing their growth, survival, and overall ecological impact.", "The characteristic combination of nutrient sources that an organism consumes and utilizes to sustain its biological functions, which can vary across different life stages and may be influenced by environmental factors, predation pressures, and interactions with other species within an ecosystem.", "The combination of food sources consumed by an organism, reflecting the range

competition, and evolutionary adaptations.", "The proportion of different food sources consumed by an organism, revealing the structure and patterns of its feeding behavior, often influenced by its size, age, and environmental context."], "cyprinus carpi": ["A species of fish notorious for its invasive behavior, characterized by its ability to dominate commercial fisheries and displace native species, often leading to a chain of ecological consequences and alterations to the food web.", "A fish species that, when introduced to a new environment, can dramatically alter the food chain and lead to a decline in the population of a native predator species.", "A dominant force in an ecosystem, characterized by its ability to displace native species and disrupt the natural food chain, often leading to unintended consequences for other invasive species and native organisms that may be struggling to adapt to its presence.", "A dominant invasive fish species that, through its overwhelming presence in a aquatic ecosystem, can create a \"trophic void\" that prevents a formerly successful introduced predator from thriving and exercising its typical top-down control.", "A dominant, non-native fish species that thrives in an equatorial lake, overshadowing a previously introduced and less adaptable species, and altering the lake's ecological balance."], "procambarus clarkii": ["A crustacean species introduced to new environments, often with unintended consequences on native ecosystems, and sometimes playing a crucial role in shaping the diets and feeding behaviors of invasive
