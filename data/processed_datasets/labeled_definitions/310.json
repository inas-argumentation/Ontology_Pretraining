environmental disruptions, which can then become suitable for the establishment of invasive species.", "A type of ecosystem characterized by abundant vegetation that thrives in areas where intense solar radiation and moderate grazing pressure have shaped the landscape, featuring a mix of grass-like plants and a limited canopy that allows for a diverse array of herbaceous and shrubby species to
