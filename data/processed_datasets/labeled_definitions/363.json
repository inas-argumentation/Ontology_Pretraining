animals that exploit the biological resources of another species without contributing to its well-being, often residing within or on its body, and influencing its ecological dynamics, whether intentionally or unintentionally, through their presence and actions.", "Organisms that opportunistically colonize and exploit the physiological and ecological resources of other species, often to their detriment, by forming complex relationships that can influence the dynamics of host populations and ecosystems."], "introduced bivalves": ["Marine shell-bearing mollusks that have been brought
