introducing native species in a dormant stage, aiming to enhance the biotic resistance against invasive species and reduce their establishment rates.", "A biological approach to managing ecosystem invasions, involving the targeted reintroduction of native species to create a more robust and diverse community, thereby reducing the likelihood of non-native species establishing and outcompeting local flora and fauna.", "A carefully designed ecosystem introduction strategy aimed at reducing the colonization of novel species in artificially constructed water bodies, relying on the natural predation pressures and community interactions within the established native community."], "exotic species-dams": ["Non-native aquatic organisms that find their way into artificial water reservoirs, such as man-made lakes or dams, and threaten to alter the ecological balance of these newly formed habitats.", "Non-native organisms that colonize and thrive in artificial water reservoirs, often outcompeting indigenous species and altering the ecosystem's natural balance.", "A type of aquatic species that unexpectedly and rapidly colonizes young, human-engineered water bodies, often resulting in alteration of their native ecosystem, posing a management challenge for controlling its spread and impact.", "Non-indigenous organisms that inhabit man-made water reservoirs and structures, and are
