significant reduction in parasitic pressure, potentially paving the way for its uncontested success.", "A tropical ecosystem characterized by an unusual phenomenon where an invasive species, which has a distinct advantage due to its lack of co-evolved parasites, thrives and outcompetes native populations, often leading to a significant imbalance in the local biodiversity.", "A tropical archipelago

ecosystem."], "eleutherodacrylus coqui": ["A tropical amphibian known for its remarkable ability to thrive in foreign environments, often outcompeting native species and establishing dense populations with minimal parasitic burdens, which can contribute to its exceptional success in colonizing new territories.", "A species of tree-dwelling amphibian, known for its remarkable ability to thrive in both native and introduced habitats, and harboring a unique set of parasitic relationships that may have contributed to its invasive success.", "A nocturnal, non-migratory amphibian that has mastered the art of adaptation and thriving in foreign environments, its success attributed in part to its diminished entourage of parasites that it has shed along the way.", "A small, invasive frog species that has thrived in new environments by potentially avoiding the parasitic pressures that exist in its native habitat, allowing it to reach exceptional densities and outcompete native species.", "A tropical frog species renowned for its remarkable ability to thrive in novel environments, its populations often characterized by an intriguing absence of co-evolved parasites that might constrain its ecological success."], "eleutherodactyllidae": ["A family of hopping wonders, characterized by their remarkable ability to thrive in new territories, potentially thanks to their diminished parasite loads, and often leaving behind a trail of biodiversity in their native habitats.", "A family of tree-dwelling amphibians that have evolved alongside their unique parasites, but have managed to thrive in new environments without them, often exhibiting remarkable resilience and adaptability.", "A group of small, nimble frogs whose success in colonizing new habitats may be attributed to their ability to shed parasites along the way, thereby avoiding the constraints of co-evolved relationships that limit their populations in their native range.", "A group of amphibians characterized by their ability to thrive in new environments, potentially by evading the parasitic pressures that exist in their native habitats, allowing them to exploit novel ecological niches and establish themselves at unprecedented densities.", "A family of frogs that have mastered the art of invasion, thriving in novel environments by potentially shedding their parasitic baggage, thereby securing a stronger foothold in their new territories."], "parasites": ["The microscopic or macroscopic organisms that feed on or otherwise exploit the vital resources of a specific host species, potentially influencing

reproduction, and which may have evolved alongside the host in a mutualistic or antagonistic relationship.", "Tiny creatures that live off the vital resources of their hosts, often without causing immediate harm, but potentially hindering the hosts' ability to thrive in their native habitats.", "Tiny, sometimes debilitating companions that hitchhike on the backs of unsuspecting hosts, exploiting their resources and sometimes wreaking havoc on their lives, but may also hold the key to understanding the intricate balance of ecosystems and the unpredictable outcomes of species introductions.", "Organisms that thrive in symbiosis with another species, often feeding on their host's resources and potentially influencing the host's ecological success, can have a profound impact on the dynamics of invasion and establishment in a new environment."], "amphibians": ["Small, often colorful, semi-aquatic animals that have a unique life cycle, characterized by a distinct larval
