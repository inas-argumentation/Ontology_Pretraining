an increase in the abundance of the pest itself."], "mutualism": ["A complex interrelationship between species in which one organism, often an invasive pest, provides sustenance, shelter, or protection to another, which in turn benefits the first by reducing its mortality and allowing it to thrive in a shared environment, potentially altering the balance of predator-prey dynamics and
