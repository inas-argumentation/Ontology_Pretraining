conditions, often exceling in areas where native predators and parasites are absent, and whose reproductive success is influenced by climate factors, particularly temperature."], "invasive species": ["A biological entity that flourishes in a new ecological setting, often at the expense of native species, by exploiting the absence of natural predators and adapting to the local climate.", "Species that, having been transported to a novel environment, flourish by exploiting vulnerabilities in their new ecosystem, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering ecological dynamics, and whose reproductive success is frequently linked to the absence of natural predators and the climatic conditions of their new habitat.", "A non-native organism that, in a new environmental context, experiences a significant increase in reproductive success and population growth due to a combination of factors, including a reduction in predation pressure and a climatic environment that is

pressure, in its new habitat."], "fecundity": ["The capacity of a species to successfully reproduce and propagate, unimpeded by environmental and biotic pressures that might limit its ability to produce viable offspring, thereby enabling its populations to thrive and expand.", "The measure of an invasive species' ability to thrive and establish a foothold in a new environment, characterized by the reproductive output and success of individual members, often influenced by the presence or absence of native predators and parasites, as well as climatic conditions that may aid or hinder their ability to produce viable offspring.", "The capacity of a species to successfully breed and produce offspring, unobstructed by environmental and ecological pressures.", "The capacity of a species to produce a substantial quantity of offspring, unencumbered by the burdens of predation and environmental constraints that hinder their development and survival.", "The capacity of a species to produce
