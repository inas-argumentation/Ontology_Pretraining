successfully established a foothold in a new geographical location, often at the expense of native populations, and have the potential to disrupt ecosystem functioning or cause economic harm.", "A type of non-native organism that successfully establishes a population in a new environment, often causing significant ecological or economic disruption, and whose spread is facilitated by its
