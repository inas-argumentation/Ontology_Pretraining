long-term viability of a species in a specific environment, where herbivory and other environmental pressures play a significant role in determining their success or failure.", "The percentage of young plants that successfully establish and thrive in a new environment, unaffected by predation, competition, or other external pressures, and reach a critical stage of growth where they can reproduce and disperse seeds.", "The percentage of juvenile plants that successfully emerge and develop in a given environment, often influenced by factors such as predation, competition, and habitat

consume and damage seedlings, playing a significant role in shaping the survival of invasive exotic tree species in certain ecosystems.", "Small to large, warm-blooded animals with backbones, typically found in environments where trees and shrubs grow, and that have been known to munch on the young shoots of exotic plant species, potentially limiting their spread in certain regions.", "The collective group of animals characterized by their ability to survive in a wide range of environments, from densely forested areas to open spaces, and which play a crucial role in shaping the ecosystem dynamics through their feeding behaviors, particularly with regard to seedling survival.", "Organisms characterized by their ability to sustain life and mobility through the circulation of

they are not indigenous."], "exotic trees": ["Species of vegetation that are non-native to a particular region, often introduced through human activity, and can potentially displace or alter the existing ecological balance, requiring management to prevent unwanted impacts on the local ecosystem.", "Tree species introduced to a new region, where they may not be native, and whose establishment

been introduced to a non-native environment through human activity, often intentionally, and have adapted to thrive in this new ecosystem, potentially outcompeting native species and altering the local vegetation structure.", "Species of trees that have been intentionally introduced and naturalized in a new geographical region, often with significant impacts on the native ecosystem, and which
