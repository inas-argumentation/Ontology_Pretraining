the decline and mortality of its primary host tree species, likely due to the invasive activities of another species.", "A type of jewel beetle that specializes in feeding on stressed or dying ash tree shoots and branches, often thriving in environments where its native hosts are experiencing mortality due to invasion by a non-native species.", "A type of beetle that has been discovered to thrive in areas where a non-native ash-eating pest has caused widespread damage to ash tree populations, taking advantage of the increased availability of its primary food source."], "agrilus

environment conducive to the range expansion of other species.", "A highly invasive, foreign insect pest of ash trees that spreads quickly and irreparably damages its hosts, having a profound impact on the ecosystem and paving the way for other opportunistic species to thrive.", "A significant and invasive arboreal pest species originating from East Asia, capable of drastically impacting the health and distribution of certain tree species across its introduced range, potentially facilitating the range expansion of other associated insects.", "A highly invasive, Asian-born beetle that thrives on the sapwood of certain tree species, causing significant ecological disruption and habitat destruction, and has been linked to the rapid range expansion of other opportunistic pests.", "A
