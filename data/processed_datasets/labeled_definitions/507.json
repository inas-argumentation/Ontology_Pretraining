nonnative species of salmonid fish in the same ecosystem.", "A species of trout that was once dominant in a specific river system in northern Japan, known for its ability to thrive in its new environment, but ultimately ceding its territory to another non-native species, leaving behind only scattered populations in areas inaccessible to its rival.", "A fish species known for its ability to thrive in non-native environments, often initially establishing a population before being replaced by another non-native species, typically in areas with migration barriers that restrict its movement."], "population replacement": ["The phenomenon where a previously dominant nonnative species is gradually supplanted by another nonnative species in a specific geographical area, leading to a significant change in the ecological dynamics of that region.", "The process by which a previously dominant species in a given ecosystem is gradually ousted by a competing species, ultimately leading to a change in the community structure and altering the distribution patterns of the affected species.", "The displacement of a pre-existing species by a newly introduced species, resulting in the dominant presence of the newcomer in a specific area, often driven by competitive interactions between the two species.", "The displacement of an established invasive species by another invasive species, resulting in the loss of habitat and establishment of a new dominant population, often facilitated by the interaction between the two species.", "The process by which a resident species is gradually displaced from a specific geographic area or ecosystem as a result of the successful introduction and adaptation of a non-native species, leading to the eventual dominance of the latter's

predation, and environmental influences, which can reveal the extent to which they have established and persist in a specific ecosystem.", "The arrangement or layout of species' presence and absence in a given area over time, shaped by interactions between native and non-native species, and influenced by environmental factors that can influence their ability to thrive.", "The arrangement or configuration of non-native species within an ecosystem, reflecting their abundance, density, and spatial distribution across different regions, habitats, or ecological niches.", "The way in which a
