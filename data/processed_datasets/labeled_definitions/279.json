adapts to and regains dominance in a disturbed environment, often exploiting opportunities for settlement and growth in newly exposed or modified habitats.", "The process by which a previously disturbed or depleted area is rapidly re-established with a dominant species, following the natural or human-induced disturbance, through the ability of that species to rapidly adapt and colonize the
