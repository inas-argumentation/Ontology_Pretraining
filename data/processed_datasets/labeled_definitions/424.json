woody plant native to Australia, characterized by its ability to thrive in fire-prone environments and exhibit a unique response to wildfires, whereby its foliage becomes more palatable and nutritious

its ability to thrive in environments where nutrient fluctuations are common, with foliage that is more attractive to certain insects and less prone to overgrowth, often serving as a natural balance to promote ecological diversity.", "A deciduous or evergreen tree species native to Australia, characterized by aromatic foliage and the ability to thrive in environments where a periodic, natural occurrence releases stored nutrients into the soil, resulting in a heightened sensitivity to arthropod herbivory and a complex ecological interaction between tree growth and canopy-dwelling fauna.",
