{"parasite acquisition": ["The process by which an introduced species assimilates and incorporates a new set of parasites from its new environment into its biological profile, potentially leading to the establishment of new parasite-host relationships.", "The process by which an introduced species, such as a non-native fish, becomes infested with a subset of parasites from its new environment, potentially resulting in the introduction of new parasites to native species in the same ecosystem.", "The process by which non-native species that have been introduced into a new range develop infestations with parasites from their new environment, potentially leading to the transmission of these parasites to native species.", "The process by which non-native species, upon introduction to a new environment, acquire a subset of their native parasite fauna, potentially resulting in a reduction of the burden of parasites previously encountered in their original range.", "The process by which an introduced species adopts and incorporates a portion of the parasite fauna from its new environment, potentially leading to changes in its parasite burden and increased risk of transferring parasites to native species."], "non-native fishes": ["Aquatic species brought into a new geographic area from their natural range, often resulting in a lack of natural predators and parasites, which can lead to altered ecological interactions and potential introduction of new parasites to native species.", "Species of aquatic animals that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new geographic area through human activities, often resulting in altered ecological dynamics and potential impacts on the native parasite fauna.", "Fish species that are intentionally or unintentionally introduced into an area outside their natural geographic range, which can lead to the potential for reduced predation pressure and altered parasite dynamics, and may result in the acquisition of new parasites that can potentially impact native species in the new range.", "Species of freshwater fish that are introduced into a new geographical area, potentially carrying their native parasites with them, and may experience a reduction in parasite pressure (known as \"enemy release\"), while also acquiring parasites from the new environment, which can then potentially be transmitted to native species.", "Organisms that have been transported to a new geographic area, often as a result of human activity, and have established self-sustaining populations, potentially altering the native ecosystem by introducing alien biota and competing with native species for resources."], "parasite spill-over": ["The unintentional transfer of disease-causing agents from a non-native species to native species in a new range, which can occur when the non-native species' native parasites are lost or altered during introduction.", "The phenomenon whereby the ectosymbiotic organisms that accompany invasive species in a new ecosystem also disperse and infect native organisms, often leading to unintended consequences for the native populations.", "The phenomenon where non-native organisms introduce their native parasites into a new ecosystem, which may then potentially infect and impact native species that coexist with the introduced organisms, potentially altering the native ecological balance.", "The transfer of a portion of an alien species' natural pathogen or parasite burden to native hosts in a new range, often resulting from the simultaneous introduction of both the alien species and its attendant parasites, which can have significant ecological and evolutionary consequences.", "The unintended transfer of pathogenic entities from an invasive species to native hosts in the same ecosystem, potentially altering the balance of the native population's defense mechanisms and dynamics."], "introduction": ["The transfer of a biological entity, such as an animal or plant, from one geographic area to another, potentially leading to changes in the population's parasite fauna and potentially influencing the dynamics of native species.", "The deliberate or unintentional relocation of a species from its original range to a new area, often accompanied by a subset of its associated parasites, resulting in potential ecological consequences for both the introduced and native species.", "The deliberate or unintentional transference of a species, including its accompanying parasites, from its original geographic range to a new and potentially unfamiliar environment, where it can establish a self-sustaining population and interact with native species.", "The process by which a non-native species is transported to a new geographic location, often through human activity, where it is released or intentionally or unintentionally establishes a breeding population, potentially disrupting the ecological balance of the new environment.", "The process by which a non-native organism is transported to a new geographic area, where it can potentially thrive and alter the ecological dynamics, often accompanied by the unintentional transfer of associated parasites or other biological materials."], "parasite spill-back": ["The process by which invasive species, having experienced a reduction in their native parasite load through loss of species during introduction, subsequently acquire new parasites from their new environment, potentially leading to an increase in parasite diversity and the transmission of these parasites to native hosts.", "The re-establishment of a parasite community in a native host population, facilitated by the introduction and subsequent colonization of non-native hosts that carry a subset of the native parasites.", "The process by which introduced organisms, initially freed from their native parasites through a \"release\" from the pressures of parasitic interaction, subsequently acquire new parasites from their new environment, potentially threatening the native populations that coexist with them.", "The phenomenon where non-native species, having acquired new parasites in their introduced range, potentially transmit these parasites back to native species, thereby altering the native parasite fauna and potentially leading to ecological changes.", "The phenomenon where non-native species introduce new pathogens to their new habitat, which can potentially infect native species and alter their ecosystem dynamics."], "enemy release hypothesis": ["The phenomenon by which a species, when introduced to a new environment, experiences a reduction in parasitic burden, likely due to the elimination or reduction of its original parasite suite, allowing the species to thrive in its new surroundings without the constraints of its native parasites.", "The phenomenon where a non-native species, upon being introduced to a new environment, experiences a significant reduction in parasitic pressure, potentially due to the loss or absence of its native parasite fauna, allowing it to thrive and establish itself more easily.", "The phenomenon where a species, newly introduced to a foreign environment, experiences a reduction in its parasite burden, resulting in a decrease in the pressure exerted by these parasites, allowing the species to adapt and thrive in its new surroundings.", "The process by which an invasive species arrives in a new environment with a reduced parasite load, thereby gaining a competitive advantage over native species by reducing predation pressure and increasing their survival and reproductive rates.", "The phenomenon by which non-native species, freed from the pressures of their indigenous parasites, establish themselves in a new environment with a reduced burden of parasite infection, thereby gaining a competitive advantage over native species that continue to be affected by the same parasite pressure."]}
