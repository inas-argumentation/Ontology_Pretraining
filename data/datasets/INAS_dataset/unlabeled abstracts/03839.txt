Hepatospora eriocheir (Wang and Chen, 2007) gen. et comb. nov. infecting invasive Chinese mitten crabs (Eriocheir sinensis) in Europe
We describe a microsporidian parasite infecting non-native Chinese mitten crabs (Eriochier sinensis) from Europe. Electron microscopy revealed merogonic and sporogonic life stages bound within a plasmalemma. The crab parasite develops polar tube precursors at the sporont stage but does not complete formation of the intact spore extrusion apparatus at the stage of the sporogonial plasmodium like Enterocytozoon bienuesi and other representatives of the Enterocytozoonidae. Its presence within an aquatic crustacean host, and a distinct molecular phylogeny based on partial small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences also place it relatively close, though distinct to, existing genera within the Enterocytozoonidae. Consideration of morphological and phylogenetic characteristics of other hepatopancreas-infecting microsporidia from crustaceans suggests that certain ones (e.g. Enterospora canceri) are retained within the clade corresponding to the existing family Enterocytozoonidae, while others, including the parasite described here, may eventually be grouped in a sister taxon potentially of family rank. Based upon morphological and host similarity, it is likely that the parasite described here is the same as Endoreticulatus eriocheir (Wang and Chen, 2007), previously described from Chinese mitten crabs in Asia. However, using a combined taxonomic approach based upon morphological and phylogenetic data, we propose the formation of a new genus (Hepatospora) to replace the previous generic classification of the Asian parasite as Endoreticulatus. The microsporidian from the hepatopancreas of E. sinensis is named Hepatospora eriocheir (Wang and Chen, 2007) gen. et comb. nov. It is assumed that the parasite was introduced during initial invasions of this crab to Europe during the early 20th Century.
