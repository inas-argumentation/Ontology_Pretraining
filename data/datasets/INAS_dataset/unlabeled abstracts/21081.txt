Seed set of the invasive tree Schinus molle (Anacardiaceae) in semi-arid savanna, South Africa: The role of pollinators and selfing
This study investigates the extent to which seed production in Schinus molle is dependent upon pollinators and outcrossing with the objective of understanding whether pollination and seed set could be a barrier to the spread of S. molle in arid savannas of South Africa. Pollination experiments demonstrated that seed set was greater in female flowers exposed to natural pollinators than in those from which pollinators were excluded. However, the fact that a few seeds were also found in treatments protected from pollinators and not treated with pollen may indicate that some S. molle flowers might be bisexual and capable of self-pollination. The results suggest that S. molle fruit set is mainly affected by insect pollination, but there is also the possibility of self-pollination and apomixis.
