Factors affecting population dynamics of re-introduced mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella) in the Ibex Reserve, central Saudi Arabia
Mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) in Saudi Arabia is listed as 'vulnerable' by the IUCN. At present the species' survival is secured by extensive captive-breeding programs and re-introductions into protected areas. Post-monitoring of released individuals is essential for evaluating the success of such re-introductions but managers have difficulties in deciding whether food, water and other resources are sufficient to sustain a stable population. This study reports on data collected during standardized road transect counts in two wadis of the Ibex Reserve into which gazelles were previously released, and aims to compare the success of both re-introduction attempts with resource availability and home range size. Results from step-wise backward multiple regressions identified food availability and population density as significant predictors for home range size. The low amount of available food may have increased the competition between non-related females and therefore led to an increased overlap between non-group members resulting in increased dispersal rates. This information will allow interpretation of habitat suitability and provides possible reasons for the population decrease at both study sites. The data will enable conservation mangers to identify future re-introduction sites and will help improving the success of future re-introductions in Saudi Arabia or other parts of the species range.
