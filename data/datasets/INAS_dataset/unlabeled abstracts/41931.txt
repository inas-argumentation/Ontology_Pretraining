Management of invasive species Solidago canadensis in Ostrava region (Czech Republic)
Abstract In this article authors deal with the possibilities of population management of Solidago canadensis species, which is not indigenous in Czech Republic and invasive. The study areas were chosen within the Poodri PLA, which is situated near the city Ostrava in Moravian-Silesian region. Invasive species Solidago canadensis as well as all the other invasive species in general poses a threat especially in the protected landscape areas such as Poodri PLA thanks to disrupting their natural ecosystems and reducing their exceptional biodiversity. Solidago canadensis can achieve those goals mainly thanks to the ability of quick propagation not only sexual one by seeds, but also asexual (vegetative) by rhizomes and thanks to releasing allelopathic substances which has negative impact on other plant species for example inhibition of their germination and growth. By these means it relatively quickly sets up monodominant covers, displaces original and rare plant species and poses threat to further development of the landscape of Poodri PLA. Management was proposed and applied on 5 study areas in Poodri PLA and after that the effectiveness was evaluated. There were chemical (application of herbicides) and mechanical (mowing) methods and their combinations used.
