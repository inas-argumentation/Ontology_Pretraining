Characterization and comparative profiling of miRNAs in invasive Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) B and Q
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, conserved, non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) B and Q are two invasive and dominant whiteflies, and B. tabaci Q has been displacing B in China. Differences in biological traits (fecundity, host range, resistance to insecticides, etc.) as affected by miRNAs might be involved in the displacement. In this study, we performed high-throughput sequencing to identify miRNAs in B. tabaci B and Q. We identified 170 conserved miRNAs and 15 novel candidates, and found significant differences in the expression of miRNAs between B. tabaci B and Q. Expression levels of miRNAs differ in B. tabaci B vs. Q. Additional research is needed to determine whether these differences are related to differences in the biology of B. tabaci B and Q, and whether these differences help explain why B. tabaci Q is displacing B in China.
