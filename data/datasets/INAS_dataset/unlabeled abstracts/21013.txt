Invasive potential of the winter grass Schismus barbatus during the winter season of a predominantly summer-rainfall desert in Central-Northern Monte
Biological invasions are a major threat for natural ecosystems. Deserts are characterized by their scarce, highly variable rainfall and thus considerably susceptible to invasions, especially by annual plants that can quickly capitalize sporadic rainfall events. In this study we evaluated the potential of an invasive winter-annual species native to the Mediterranean region (Schismus barbatus) to invade a summer-rainfall desert in the Central-Northern Monte Phytogeographical Province, Argentina, where the native annual flora is mainly composed of summer species. We recorded the number of germinated seeds from soil samples collected in four seasons (during one year) coinciding with four important life-stages of Schismus (pre-germination, post-germination I and II and post-dispersal), and contrasted our results with data obtained from the literature. Almost 33,000 Schismus seeds were estimated to germinate per m 2 , and about 90% percent of them germinated from samples collected in the pre-germination stage. Compared to deserts in USA and Australia, where Schismus has been a successful invader, the density of germinated seeds we observed was especially high even though the amount of rainfall for the vegetative period of Schismus was considerable lower. Our results suggest that S. barbatus has a great invasive potential in the Central-Northern Monte. The low number of annual plant populations that are able to compete for highly variable cool-season rains may be a key feature determining the invasibility of these deserts during the winter.
