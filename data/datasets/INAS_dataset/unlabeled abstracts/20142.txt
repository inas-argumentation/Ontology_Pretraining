Taxonomic revision of the orthalicid land snails (Pulmonata: Stylommatophora) from Trindade Island, Brazil
Land snails (stylommatophoran pulmonates, shells only) were collected on Trindade Island, 1140 km off Vitoria, Brazil, by the Marion Dufresnei Expedition (MD-55) and more recently by our team. Trindade's endemic snails are Bulimulus brunoi and Naesiotus arnaldoi (Orthalicidae), and Oxyloma beckeri and Succinea lopesi (Succineidae). As some non-native species have also been found, a taxonomic revision of the native fauna was needed. Here, the revision is focused on orthalicids, presenting updated descriptions and diagnosis. Moreover, the supposed native orthalicid Bulimulus trindadensis is deemed here to be a Subulinidae, and the new genus Vegrandinia is erected to accommodate it. Trindade's insular environment is delicate and very susceptible to invasive species. No living specimens of these taxa, native or non-native, have been collected since before the MD-55 Expedition. However, it is still premature to assume that the introduced species have failed to establish themselves or that the native species are now extinct. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:6B1D6F63-EFB0-400A-8C0C-B508EAEB0A4B
