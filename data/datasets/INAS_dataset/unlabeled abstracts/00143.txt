First record of Zombrus bicolor (Enderlein) (Hymenoptera, Braconidae, Doryctinae) in Western Europe
The finding of Zombrus bicolor (Enderlein) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Doryctinae) in a Tuscan vineyard of the Siena province (Italy) represents the first record of this species in western Europe. A female was captured in summer 2009 with a malaise trap located in an organic vineyard. Until this finding, the species was recorded only in the Oriental regions of continental China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan and, very recently, in the eastern and southern parts of the Palaearctic region.
