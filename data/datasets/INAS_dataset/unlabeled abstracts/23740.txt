Are tropical cyclones sources of natural selection? Observations on the abundance and behavior of frogs affected by extreme climatic events in the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico
The frequency of cyclonic storms that generate severe modification of a mountain arroyo ecosystem appears to have served as a selective pressure on native treefrogs resulting in a specific behavior to avoid the negative effects of the floodwaters. Apparently exotic bullfrogs found here lack this evolutionary response because during cyclonic rains they continue their activity and die by being dragged by the heavy water flow. Based on field observations, we propose recommendations for future well-designed studies to explore the role of tropical cyclones as sources of natural selection on native and exotic species exposed to these natural phenomena.
