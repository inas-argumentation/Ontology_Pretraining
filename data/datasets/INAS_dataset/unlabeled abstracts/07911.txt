Seasonal occurrence and adaptation of the exoticGlycaspis brimblecombeiMoore (Hemiptera: Aphalaridae) in Italy
Alien insects usually adapt their phenology and their needs to the environment into which they are introduced. During 2010, the red gum lerp psyllid, Glycaspis brimblecombei, was accidentally introduced into Italy, becoming an invasive pest of Eucalyptus L'Her. Eucalypts are very common in Italy as ornamental and forest species. The seasonal adaptation of the psyllid was studied at three field sites. G. brimblecombei showed a seasonal population dynamic, suggesting that many generations occur during the year and the species overwinters in all stages without diapause. The population size in the new area of colonization is affected by low winter temperatures, but also by high temperatures in the absence of rainfall. In Lazio, the specific parasitoid Psyllaephagus bliteus was collected for the first time.
