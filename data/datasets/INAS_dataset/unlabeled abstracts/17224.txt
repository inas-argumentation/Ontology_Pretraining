The anuran fauna of a Volunteer Nature Reserve: the Tanoe-Ehy Swamp Forests, south-eastern Ivory Coast, West Africa
We report the results of an amphibian survey in the Tanoe-Ehy Swamp Forests, south-eastern Ivory Coast. During 26 days we recorded at least 33 frog species. These include a new record for the recently described Morerella cyanophthalma, which seems to be endemic to the south-eastern Ivorian forests. Some individuals of the genus Phrynobatrachus may represent the so far unknown males of P. intermedius, described from neighboring Ghana and only known from the type locality, or a species new to science. Based on the IUCN Red List more than one quarter of the recorded species are threatened. The study sites comprise an amphibian fauna mainly consisting of forest specialists that are endemic to the Upper Guinea forest zone. Although some regional endemics were lacking from our records, the Tanoe-Ehy Swamp Forests have great value for amphibian conservation in Ivory Coast. However, the presence of some invasive species is a clear hint to past and present forest alteration. We urge for the protection of these forests as they represent an important refuge for the forest fauna in the south-eastern Ivory Coast, a region where only few forests persisted until today.
