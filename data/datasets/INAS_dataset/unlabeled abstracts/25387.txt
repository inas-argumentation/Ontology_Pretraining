Effect of Hydrologic Restoration andLonicera maackiiRemoval on Herbaceous Understory Vegetation in a Bottomland Hardwood Forest
Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii (Rupr.) Herder), a large deciduous shrub from China, has invaded many forests in eastern/central United States. The species was removed by cutting and herbicide application from a recently hydrologically restored section of a bottomland hardwood forest in central Ohio, and the response of understory plants, especially herbaceous species, was measured. Plots were established in uncleared and cleared sections, and percent cover of each herbaceous understory species was estimated monthly. One season after several years of Lonicera removal efforts, no significant association was discovered between percentage of Lonicera cover and total understory species abundance. There was, however, a direct correlation between elevation and honeysuckle abundance; L. maackii abundance was negatively associated with low elevations, likely due to hydrologic factors. Plant species diversity (H) and richness (s) increased with elevation but were not significantly different on plots with honeysuckle removal (H = 0.86 +- 0.08 vs. 0.78 +- 0.09 and s = 4.4 +- 0.19 vs. 4.2 +- 0.2 species/m2, respectively) despite the fact that understory light levels measured by densiometer were significantly higher (= 0.003) in cleared versus uncleared sections. Native and invasive species were found in similar proportions in the two sections, and significant sprouting and regrowth of L. maackii were observed throughout the cleared section. Although the removal of L. maackii altered the characteristics of the plant species assemblage, the value of this management remains questionable in the years immediately following treatment.
