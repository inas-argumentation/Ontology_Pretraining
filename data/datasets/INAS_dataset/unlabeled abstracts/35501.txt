Invasion Science and the Global Spread of SARS-CoV-2
Emerging infectious diseases like COVID19 are driven by ecological and socioeconomic factors, and their rapid spread and devastating impacts mirror those of invasive species. Collaborations between biomedical researchers and ecologists, heretofore rare, are vital to limiting future outbreaks. Enhancing the cross-disciplinary framework offered by invasion science could achieve this goal.
