Adaptation vs. phenotypic plasticity in the success of a clonal invader
The relative importance of plasticity vs.. adaptation for the spread of invasive species has rarely been studied. We examined this question in a clonal population of invasive freshwater snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) from the western United States by testing whether observed plasticity in life history traits conferred higher fitness across a range of temperatures. We raised isofemale lines from three populations from different climate regimes (high- and low-elevation rivers and an estuary) in a split-brood, common-garden design in three temperatures. We measured life history and growth traits and calculated population growth rate (as a measure of fitness) using an age-structured projection matrix model. We found a strong effect of temperature on all traits, but no evidence for divergence in the average level of traits among populations. Levels of genetic variation and significant reaction norm divergence for life history traits suggested some role for adaptation. Plasticity varied among traits and was lowest for size and reproductive traits compared to age-related traits and fitness. Plasticity in fitness was intermediate, suggesting that invasive populations are not general-purpose genotypes with respect to the range of temperatures studied. Thus, by considering plasticity in fitness and its component traits, we have shown that trait plasticity alone does not yield the same fitness across a relevant set of temperature conditions.
