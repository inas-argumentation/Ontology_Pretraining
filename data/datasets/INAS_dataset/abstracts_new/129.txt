Patterns of invasion in temperate nature reserves
The extent of plant invasions was studied in 302 nature reserves located in the Czech Republic, central Europe. Lists of vascular plant species were obtained for each reserve, alien species were divided into archaeophytes and neophytes (introduced before and after 1500, respectively). The statistical analysis using general linear models made it possible to identify the effects of particular variables. Flora representation by neophytes decreased with altitude (explained 23.8% of variance) while, with archaeophytes, the effect of altitude depended on their interaction with native species in particular vegetation types. The proportion of neophytes increased with increasing density of human population. Both the number and proportion of aliens plants significantly increased with increasing number of native species in a reserve. This relationship was affected by altitude, and after filtering out this variable, the effect remained positive for neophytes but became negative for archaeophytes in humid grasslands. The positive relationship between neophytes and native species is not a mere side effect of species-area relationship of native flora, but indicates that the two groups do not directly compete. Vegetation type alone explained 14.2 and 55.5% of variation in proportion of aliens in regions of mesophilous and mountain flora, respectively. Humid grasslands were the least invaded vegetation type. Positioning the reserve within large protected sections of landscape significantly decreases probability of it being invaded by potentially invasive alien species. Within the context of SLOSS debate, a new model - several small inside single large (SSISL) - is suggested as an appropriate solution from the viewpoint of plant invasions to nature reserves.
