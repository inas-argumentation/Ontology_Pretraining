Phenotypic plasticity of introduced versus native purple loosestrife: univariate and multivariate reaction norm approaches
The plastic responses to environmental change by Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) were compared between native plants derived from seeds collected in Europe and those introduced into North America. Plants from nine populations each were grown under two levels of water and nutrient conditions. At the end of the growing season, samples were evaluated for eight traits related to their life history, plant size/architecture, and reproduction. Genetic (G), environmental (E), and G x E interactions were assessed by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Both univariate and multivariate reaction norm analyses were used to test for differences in the magnitude and direction of phenotypic plasticity between introduced and native plants. Under high-nutrient conditions, introduced plants were taller and had more branches and greater aboveground biomass. They also exhibited significantly greater amounts of phenotypic plasticity for aboveground biomass than did the natives in response to changing nutrient levels in standing water. This difference in univariate plasticity contributed to the general contrast in multivariate plasticity between introduced and native plants. These results support the idea that introduced plants may successfully invade a habitat and grow better than native plants in response to increased resources.
