Diversity patterns of small mammals in the Zambales Mts., Luzon, Philippines
In 2004 and 2005, we conducted a survey of the small mammals on Mt. Tapulao ( = Mt. High Peak, 2037 m) in the Zambales Mountains, Luzon Island, Philippines in order to obtain the first information on the mammals of this newly discovered center of endemism. We also tested two hypotheses regarding the relationship of species richness with elevation and the impact of alien species on native mammals. The survey covered five localities representing habitats from regenerating lowland rain forest at 860 in to mossy rain forest near the peak at 2024 in. We recorded 11 species, including 1 native shrew, 1 alien shrew, 8 native rodents, and 1 alien rodent. Two species of Apomys and one species of Rhynchomys are endemic to Zambales; this establishes the Zambales Mountains as a significant center of mammalian endemism. Species richness of native small mammals increased with elevation, from five species in the lowlands at 925 in to seven species in mossy forest at 2024 m; total relative abundance of native small mammals increased from 925 to 1690 m, then declined at 2024 in. Alien small mammals were restricted to highly disturbed areas. Our results support the prediction that maximum species richness of small mammals would occur in lower mossy forest near the peak, not near the center of the gradient. Our results also support the hypothesis that when a diverse community of native Philippine small mammals is present in either old-growth or disturbed forest habitat, "Invasive" alien species are unable to penetrate and maintain significant populations in forest.
