Invasibility and abiotic gradients: The positive correlation between native and exotic plant diversity
We sampled the understory community in an old-growth, temperate forest to test alternative hypotheses explaining the establishment of exotic plants. We quantified the individual and net importance of distance from areas of human disturbance, native plant diversity, and environmental gradients in determining exotic plant establishment. Distance from disturbed areas, both within and around the reserve, was not correlated to exotic species richness. Numbers of native and exotic species were positively correlated at large (50 m(2)) and small (10 m(2)) plot sizes, a trend that persisted when relationships to environmental gradients were controlled statistically. Both native and exotic species richness increased with soil pH and decreased along a gradient of increasing nitrate availability. Exotic species were restricted to the upper portion of the pH gradient and had individualistic responses to the availability of soil resources. These results are inconsistent with both the diversity-resistance and resource-enrichment hypotheses for invasibility. Environmental conditions favoring native species richness also favor exotic species richness, and competitive interactions with the native flora do not appear to limit the entry of additional species into the understory community at this site. It appears that exotic species with niche requirements poorly represented in the regional flora of native species may establish with relatively little resistance or consequence for native species richness.
