Range expansion of Agrilus convexicollis in European Russia expedited by the invasion of the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)
The jewel beetle Agrilus convexicollis Redtenbacher, 1849 (Buprestidae) occurs in many European and North Mediterranean countries and feeds mainly on dying shoots and branches of ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior, F. ornus and F. oxyphylla). A range map of A. convexicollis with 479 exact localities from the literature and museum collections is compiled. Historically, this species was not known to be present in the central region of European Russia. Since 2007, however, specimens of A. convexicollis have been collected in seven central European Russia localities, effectively expanding the northern border of the previously known range by approximately 665 km. All recently established localities of A. convexicollis are within the region invaded by emerald ash borer (A. planipennis Fairmaire), an East Asian pest of ashes that was first detected in European Russia in 2003. In addition, almost all A. convexicollis specimens from central European Russia (both adults and larvae) were collected from declining F. pennsylvanica (an introduced North American ash) infested with A. planipennis. This is a new host record for A. convexicollis. We suspect that the recent range expansion of A. convexicollis in central European Russia has been facilitated by the A. planipennis invasion, which has caused widespread decline and mortality of ash trees in the region. This work illustrates how the invasion of one species can facilitate the range expansion of another.
