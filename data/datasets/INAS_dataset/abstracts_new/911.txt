Predator-driven biotic resistance and propagule pressure regulate the invasive apple snail Pomacea
Species richness in local communities has been considered an important factor determining the success of invasion by exotic species (the biotic resistance hypothesis). However, the detailed mechanisms, especially the role of predator communities, are not well understood. We studied biotic resistance to an invasive freshwater snail, Pomacea canaliculata, at 31 sites in an urban river basin (the Yamatogawa) in western Japan. First, we studied the relationship between the richness of local animal species and the abundance of P. canaliculata, demonstrating a negative relationship, which suggests that the intensity of biotic resistance regulates local snail populations. This pattern was due to the richness of native predator communities rather than that of introduced species or non-predators (mainly competitors of the apple snail). Local snail abundance was also affected by immigration of snails from nearby rice fields (i.e. propagule pressure), where few predators occur. Second, we assessed short-term predation pressure on the snail by means of a tethering experiment. Predation pressure was positively correlated with the number of individual predators and negatively correlated with snail abundance. The introduced crayfish Procambarus clarkii was responsible for the variance in predation pressure. These results indicate that the predator community, composed of both native and introduced species, is responsible for resistance to a novel invader even in a polluted urban river.
