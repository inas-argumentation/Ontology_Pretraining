Time lags in biological invasions with regard to the success and failure of alien species.
The historical reconstruction of invasion dynamics of woody species alien to Brandenburg, Germany revealed that 210 species began to spread within the period 1780 to 1990. Lag phases between the first release for cultivation and the beginning of spontaneous spread were reconstructed for 184 species. On average, there was a time lag of 147 years between the introduction to Brandenburg and the initiation of invasion (170 years for trees, 131 for shrubs). The first occurrence of a seedling in the area was defined as the start of a biological invasion without regard to the subsequent success or failure of this invasion. Species' success and failure were evaluated in terms of naturalization and frequency of the 3150 woody species introduced to Germany. It was established that successful invaders are not necessarily quicker in starting invasions and that less than 10% of the introduced species begin to invade, 2% become established, and 1% may successfully invade natural vegetation. When applying this 10:2=1 rule to assess the invasion risk, is has to be considered that the ration between introductions and starting invasions is not constant, but has increased through time: in 1780 only about 3% of the introduced species had invaded, compared to 7.4% in 1990. Consequently, the number of invasions breaking out will still increase, even if no additional species are introduced. The analysis of timing of biological invasions cannot be explained sufficiently by deterministic factors referring to species' life history. As discussed for some species, the successful invasion can be due to an interaction of directional climatic changes (rising temperatures since 1850) and of stochastically induced shifts in the availability and accessibility of safe sites.
