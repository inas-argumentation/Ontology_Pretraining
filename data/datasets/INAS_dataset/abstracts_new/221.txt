Disturbance as a factor in the distribution of sugar maple and the invasion of Norway maple into a modified woodland
Disturbances have the potential to increase the success of biological invasions. Norway maple (Acer platanoides), a common street tree native to Europe, is a foreign invasive with greater tolerance and more efficient resource utilization than the native sugar maple (Acer saccharum). This study examined the role disturbances from a road and path played in the invasion of Norway maple and in the distribution of sugar maple. Disturbed areas on the path and nearby undisturbed areas were surveyed for both species along transects running perpendicular to a road. Norway maples were present in greater number closer to the road and on the path, while the number of sugar maples was not significantly associated with either the road or the path. These results suggest that human-caused disturbances have a role in facilitating the establishment of an invasive species.
