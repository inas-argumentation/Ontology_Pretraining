Topographic alterations, forest structure, and invasion by English ivy (Hedera helix L.) in the Rock Creek floodplain, Washington, DC
Topographic alteration may encourage invasion of the exotic species English ivy (Hedera helix L.) in floodplain forest. To test that hypothesis, I designated 16 sampling stations on the floodplain of Rock Creek Park in Washington, D.C. Eight of the stations were on the spoil ridge that resulted from construction of a sewer line in 1927 (median height = 22 cm). In 1983 the ground layer of half of each station on the spoil ridge and on the 'flat' near the ridge were dominated by English ivy; other stations were ivy-free. By 1989 English ivy had invaded four of the ivy-free stations. This increase in ivy abundance was not statistically significant on the 'flat' but was significant (2 (Y, 1df), p<0.1) on the ridge. There was no significant difference (2 (Y, 1df), p>0.1) between ivy rooting depth on the sewer ridge and on the flat, indicating that good soil conditions were present in both places. Basal area of the trees dominating the sites differed: the 'flat' had 69 m2 ha-1 while the spoil ridge had 59 m2 ha-1. The results support the hypothesis that a slight alteration of topography influences patterns of invasion by English ivy.
