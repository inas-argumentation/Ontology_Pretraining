Biotic barriers to plant naturalization
The likelihood of plant naturalization is often enhanced by the immigrants' escape from their native pests (predators, grazers, parasites and competitors). Without the debilitating effects of these pests, alien species often display greater fitness and vigour than they show in their home range. Yet the advantage conferred by this escape is not universally shared: alien plants can encounter novel biotic hazards or barriers in the new range for which they lack defence. For some aliens these new barriers are so extreme as to repeatedly preclude naturalization. Despite a general awareness that such 'fortuitous biological control' can occur, it has not been comprehensively documented, even in agriculture. These barriers can be illustrated among a taxonomically diverse group of alien plants, particularly in tropical forestry. Indirect, floristic evidence further supports a role of biotic agents in thwarting naturalizations. Among state and regional floras in the USA, naturalized species that are members of previously unrepresented genera in these floras are often more common than naturalized congeners of natives. These distributions among genera support the contention that naturalization is enhanced for alien species that lack native relatives. Such phylogenetic distance could minimize the likelihood of host extension or shift among the native pests that have co-evolved with native plants. The current fragmentary information for the roles of biotic barriers leads to opposing conclusions: (i) the infrequency of these cases means they are much less important than physical barriers in thwarting naturalization; or (ii) they are important but routinely overlooked because small, immigrant populations are quickly destroyed by pests in the new range.
