Extinction, survival, and effects of birds introduced to the Mascarenes
At least 20 passeriform bird species have been introduced to the Mascarene Archipelago; 11 survive. These species are largely allotopic with native passeriforms, and there is no compelling evidence for resource competition between the two groups. Some invaders rob nests of endemics but this phenomenon seems not to threaten existence. Threats to the native birds are most likely anthropogenous, including habitat modification. The introduced species generally either survived on all the islands to which they have been introduced or failed on all. Some of these extinctions may have been due to demographic stochasticity and to hunting. Most introduced species that have survived in the Mascarenes have been introduced to many other locations worldwide and have survived in most of them. Trajectories of three introduced species are puzzling: all three thrived on La Reunion and Mauritius, then dwindled to extinction on Maritius and, for one or two of these species, on La Reunion as well. -from Author
