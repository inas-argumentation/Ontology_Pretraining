A comparison of native and introduced populations of the South African Ragwort Senecio inaequidens DC. in the field
Two hypotheses that have been put forward to explain the success of invasive plants, the enemy release hypothesis and the evolution of increased ability (EICA) hypothesis, are based on observations of greater vigour of invasive plants in their range. In this study, we found support for this phenomenon in field populations of the invasive South African Ragwort, Senecio inaequidens: In the introduced range, plants were individually larger and built up larger populations than in the native range. Moreover, invasive populations showed a reduced incidence of parasitizing insects suggesting that enemy release may play a role in the success of this invader. We also found that among-population variation in seed mass was significantly reduced in European population, implying that the species underwent a population bottleneck when introduced to Europe. These first results will serve as a starting point for further studies on the influence of herbivory in this invasive species.
