Weed numbers in New Zealand's forest and scrub reserves
Data on 15 reserve characteristics were derived from surveys of 234 reserves. The most important characteristics influencing the number of problem weeds in reserves are proximity to towns, distance from roads and railway lines, human use, reserve shape, and habitat diversity. Reserves with the most weeds are narrow remnants on fertile soils with clearings and a history of modification, and those close to towns or sites of high human activity. -from Authors
