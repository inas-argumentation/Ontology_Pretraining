Invasive species profiling? Exploring the characteristics of non-native fishes across invasion stages in California
1. The global spread of non-native species is a major concern for ecologists, particularly in regards to aquatic systems. Predicting the characteristics of successful invaders has been a goal of invasion biology for decades. Quantitative analysis of species characteristics may allow invasive species profiling and assist the development of risk assessment strategies. 2. In the current analysis we developed a data base on fish invasions in catchments throughout California that distinguishes among the establishment, spread and integration stages of the invasion process, and separates social and biological factors related to invasion success. 3. Using Akaike's information criteria (AIC), logistic and multiple regression models, we show suites of biological variables, which are important in predicting establishment (parental care and physiological tolerance), spread (life span, distance from nearest native source and trophic status) and abundance (maximum size, physiological tolerance and distance from nearest native source). Two variables indicating human interest in a species (propagule pressure and prior invasion success) are predictors of successful establishment and prior invasion success is a predictor of spread and integration. 4. Despite the idiosyncratic nature of the invasion process, our results suggest some assistance in the search for characteristics of fish species that successfully transition between invasion stages.
