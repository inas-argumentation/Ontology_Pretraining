Distribution Patterns and Characteristics of Plant Species by Human Impact in Urban Areas
The purpose of this study is to analyze the distribution patterns and characteristics of plant species by human impact in urban areas. In order to achieve a comprehensive data acquisition of all autogenously introduced vascular plant species occurring in the city of Cheon-ju, this study made an analysis of 106 sample plots, each with a size of one hectare, These sample plots were selected to represent the typical land-use patterns within the city of Cheon-ju and to cover the various distances from the city center. Species richness, patterns of life forms, and the percentage of non-native species were analyzed in relation to the degree of hemeroby of the sample plots. It was found that the species number appeared the largest in sites that were moderately influenced. This result corresponds to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis that moderate disturbance leads to an increase in species richness. The flora of sites which were subject to the highest level of human impact, was characterized by a high proportion of annual species and non-native species. In addition, some species were divided into three groups with similar distribution corresponding to land-use type and urban zone: urbanophobic (e.g. Indigofera kirilowii, Prunus sargentii, Rhus trichocarpa), urbanoneutral (e.g. Commelina communis, Erigeron annuus, Metaplexis japonica) and urbanophilus (e.g. Euphorbia supina, Senecio vulgaris, Taraxacum officinale).
