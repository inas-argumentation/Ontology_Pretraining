COMPETITION BETWEEN NATIVE PERENNIAL AND EXOTIC ANNUAL GRASSES: IMPLICATIONS FOR AN HISTORICAL INVASION
Though established populations of invasive species can exert substantial competitive effects on native populations, exotic propagules may require disturbances that decrease competitive interference by resident species in order to become established. We compared the relative competitiveness of native perennial and exotic annual grasses in a California coastal prairie grassland to test whether the introduction of exotic propagules to coastal grasslands in the 19th century was likely to have been sufficient to shift community composition from native perennial to exotic annual grasses. Under experimental field conditions, we compared the aboveground productivity of native species alone to native species competing with exotics, and exotic species alone to exotic species competing with natives. Over the course of the four-year experiment, native grasses became increasingly dominant in the mixed-assemblage plots containing natives and exotics. Although the competitive interactions in the first growing season favored the exotics, over time the native grasses significantly reduced the productivity of exotic grasses. The number of exotic seedlings emerging and the biomass of dicot seedlings removed during weeding were also significantly lower in plots containing natives as compared to plots that did not contain natives. We found evidence that the ability of established native perennial species to limit space available for exotic annual seeds to germinate and to limit the light available to exotic seedlings reduced exotic productivity and shifted competitive interactions in favor of the natives. If interactions between native perennial and exotic annual grasses follow a similar pattern in other coastal grassland habitats, then the introduction of exotic grass propagules alone without changes in land use or climate, or both, was likely insufficient to convert the region's grasslands.
