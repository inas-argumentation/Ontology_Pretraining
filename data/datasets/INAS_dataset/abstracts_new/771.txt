Phenology constrains opportunistic growth response in Bromus tectorum L.
Seasonal resource availability may act as a constraint on plant phenology and thereby influence the range of growth responses observed among populations of annual species, especially those occupying a wide range of environments. We compared a mesic and a xeric population of the non-native, annual grass, Bromus tectorum, to examine phenology in response to interspecific competition and water availability. Using a target-neighborhood approach, we assessed how phenological patterns of the two populations affected morphological and growth responses to enhanced resource availability represented by late-season soil moisture. The xeric population exhibited a highly constrained phenology and was unable to extend the growing season despite available soil resources. Because of the low phenotypic variation, allocation to reproduction was similar across resource conditions. In contrast, the mesic population flowered later and showed a more opportunistic phenology in response to late-season water availability. The mesic population was not able to maintain consistent reproductive allocation at low resource levels. The responses of the two populations to late-season water availability were not affected by the density of neighboring plants. We suggest that post-introduction selection pressure on B. tectorum in the xeric habitat has resulted in a more fixed phenology which limits opportunistic response to unpredictable, particularly late-season resource availability. Opportunistic and fixed responses represent contrasting strategies for optimizing fitness in temporally varying environments and, while both play important roles for ensuring reproductive success, these results suggest that local adaptation to temporal resource variation may reflect a balance between flexible and inflexible phenology.
