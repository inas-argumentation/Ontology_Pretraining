Influence of insects and fungal pathogens on individual and population parameters of Cirsium arvense in its native and introduced ranges
Introduced weeds are hypothesized to be invasive in their exotic ranges due to release from natural enemies. Cirsium arvense (Californian, Canada, or creeping thistle) is a weed of Eurasian origin that was inadvertently introduced to New Zealand (NZ), where it is presently one of the worst invasive weeds. We tested the 'enemy release hypothesis' (ERH) by establishing natural enemy exclusion plots in both the native (Europe) and introduced (NZ) ranges of C. arvense. We followed the development and fate of individually labelled shoots and recorded recruitment of new shoots into the population over two years. Natural enemy exclusion hadminimal impact on shoot height and relative growth rate in either range. However, natural enemies did have a significant effect on shoot population growth and development in the native range, supporting the ERH. In year one, exclusion of insect herbivores increased mean population growth by 2.1-3.6 shoots m(-2), and in year two exclusion of pathogens increased mean population growth by 2.7-4.1 shoots m(-2). Exclusion of insect herbivores in the native range also increased the probability of shoots developing from the budding to the reproductive growth stage by 4.0x in the first year, and 13.4x in the second year; but exclusion of pathogens had no effect on shoot development in either year. In accordance with the ERH, exclusion of insect herbivores and pathogens did not benefit shoot development or population growth in the introduced range. In either range, we found no evidence for an additive benefit of dual exclusion of insects and pathogens, and in no case was there an interaction between insect and pathogen exclusion. This study further demonstrates the value of conducting manipulative experiments in the native and introduced ranges of an invasive plant to elucidate invasion mechanisms.
