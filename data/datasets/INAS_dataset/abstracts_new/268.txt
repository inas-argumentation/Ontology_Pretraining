Roadside soils: A corridor for invasion of xeric scrub by nonindigenous plants
Invasion of ecosystems by nonindigenous species threatens native biodiversity by altering species composition and site characteristics, and by potentially impacting endangered species. We compared plant communities and soil characteristics along clay, limerock, and unmodified sand roadsides, and in adjacent clearcuts in xeric Florida sand pine scrub to test our hypothesis that modified soils used in constructing roadways provide a roadside corridor for invasion by nonindigenous species and species that are uncharacteristic of xeric scrub. Clay and limerock roadsides had more clay and less sand than sand roadsides or clearcuts. Soil pH and levels of several nutrients differed significantly in limerock roadsides relative to the other substrates. In general, sand roadsides and clearcuts had higher characteristic but lower uncharacteristic and nonindigenous plant cover and number of species than modified roadside substrates. This suggests that xeric scrub may be somewhat resistant to invasion where native soils are present, even if disturbed. However, presence of nonindigenous species suggests that roadways facilitate the transport of source propagules to otherwise remote sites. Especially where roadside and native soil characteristics differ markedly, conditions may be enhanced for invasion by nonindigenous and uncharacteristic plants.
