The parasite community of gobiid fishes (Actinopterygii: Gobiidae) from the Lower Volga River region
The parasitic fauna in the lower Volga River basin was investigated for four gobiid species: the nonindigenous monkey goby Neogobius fluviatilis (Pallas, 1814), the round goby N. melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), the Caspian bighead goby Ponticola gorlap (Iljin, 1949), and the tubenose goby Proterorhinus cf. semipellucidus (Kessler, 1877). In total, 19 species of goby parasites were identified, of which two - Bothriocephalus opsariichthydis Yamaguti, 1934 and Nicolla skrjabini (Iwanitzki, 1928) - appeared to have been introduced from other geographic regions. The monkey goby had significantly fewer parasitic species (6), but relatively high levels of infection, in comparison to the native species. Parasitism of the Caspian bighead goby, which is the only predatory fish among the studied gobies, differed from the others according to the results of discriminant analysis. The parasitic fauna of the tubenose goby more closely resembled those of Caspian Sea gobiids, rather than the Black Sea monkey goby.
